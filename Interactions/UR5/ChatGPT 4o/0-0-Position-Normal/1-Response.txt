The task is to find the analytical inverse kinematics solution for a 1-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator with a revolute joint rotating about the Z-axis. Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Manipulator and Target
- The manipulator consists of a single revolute joint (Revolute 1) at the origin \([0, 0, 0]\), with the rotational axis along the Z-axis.
- The TCP (Tool Center Point) is located at \([0, 0.13585, 0]\) relative to the first joint.
- The task is to find the angle \(\theta\) of Revolute 1 to make the TCP reach the target position \(p = [p_x, p_y, p_z]\).

### Step 2: Analytical Approach
- The revolute joint rotates about the Z-axis, and the TCP always remains in the XY plane since there is no offset along the Z-axis.
- The transformation of the TCP under a rotation by \(\theta\) about the Z-axis is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x_{TCP} \\
  y_{TCP} \\
  0
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\theta & -\sin\theta & 0 \\
  \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0.13585 \\
  0
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- After applying the rotation matrix, the transformed TCP position in world coordinates is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x_{TCP} \\
  y_{TCP} \\
  0
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  -0.13585 \sin\theta \\
  0.13585 \cos\theta \\
  0
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- To reach the target \(p = [p_x, p_y, p_z]\), equate the TCP coordinates:
  \[
  p_x = -0.13585 \sin\theta, \quad p_y = 0.13585 \cos\theta
  \]
- Dividing these equations:
  \[
  \tan\theta = -\frac{p_x}{p_y}
  \]
- Solve for \(\theta\):
  \[
  \theta = \arctan2(-p_x, p_y)
  \]

### Step 3: Implementation
We can now implement the solution in Python. Hereâ€™s the complete function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint value needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, _ = p  # Extract target coordinates
    theta = math.atan2(-px, py)  # Compute joint angle
    return theta
```
