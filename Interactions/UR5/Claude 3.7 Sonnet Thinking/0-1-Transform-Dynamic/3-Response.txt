Looking at the forward kinematics output for joint values (0, 0), I can see the expected position of the TCP when both joints are at their zero positions. This information will help me develop the inverse kinematics solution.

Based on the robot description and the forward kinematics result, I'll derive the closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics.

First, let me understand the robot structure:
- Revolute 1 rotates around Z-axis at origin
- Revolute 2 rotates around Y-axis at position [0, 0.13585, 0] relative to joint 1
- TCP is at position [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint 2

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Note: orientation r is not used in this implementation as the robot has only 2 DOF
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (around Y-axis)
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (around Z-axis)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    if abs(sin_theta2) < 1e-10:  # Handle the case when sin(theta2) is close to zero
        theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan2(y, x) - math.atan2(0.01615, 0.425 * sin_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution works as follows:
1. We first calculate θ₂ from the z-coordinate using the relationship z = 0.425*cos(θ₂)
2. For θ₁, we have two cases:
   - When sin(θ₂) is close to zero (θ₂ is 0 or π), we use θ₁ = atan2(-x, y)
   - Otherwise, we use θ₁ = atan2(y, x) - atan2(0.01615, 0.425*sin(θ₂))

This solution correctly maps any reachable TCP position to the required joint angles.
