I'll try another test to better understand the robot's behavior with different joint configurations.

Let me analyze the forward kinematics output for joint values (1.57, 0.5):
- Joint 1 at 90° (1.57 rad) rotates the arm around the Z-axis
- Joint 2 at 0.5 rad rotates around the Y-axis of the second link
- The TCP position is approximately [-0.016, 0.204, 0.373]

This confirms my understanding of how the joints affect the TCP position. Now I can develop a better inverse kinematics solution.

After analyzing the robot structure and the forward kinematics results, I'll complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, the joint values directly correspond to the orientation
    # Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis and affects rz
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis and affects ry
    
    theta1 = rz
    theta2 = ry
    
    # Check if we need to use the alternative configuration based on rx
    if abs(rx - math.pi) < 0.1:  # rx is close to π
        theta1 = rz - math.pi if rz > 0 else rz + math.pi
        theta2 = -ry
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution recognizes that for this 2-DOF robot, the joint angles directly correspond to the orientation of the end effector, with a special case when rx is close to π (indicating the need for an alternative arm configuration).
