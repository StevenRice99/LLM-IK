Based on my analysis of the robot configuration and the forward kinematics test, I can now complete the inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the structure:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis at the origin
- Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis at position [0, 0.13585, 0]
- TCP is at position [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint 2

The solution I'm developing takes into account that for this 2-DOF robot, the orientation directly corresponds to the joint angles:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, the orientation values directly correspond to the joint angles
    # where rz (rotation around z-axis) maps to joint 1 and 
    # ry (rotation around y-axis) maps to joint 2
    
    return (rz, ry)
```

This solution directly maps the orientation values to joint angles. While this might seem overly simple, it follows from the robot's structure where joint 1 controls rotation around the Z-axis (corresponding to rz) and joint 2 controls rotation around the Y-axis (corresponding to ry).

The beauty of this solution is that it elegantly handles all the geometric complexities of the robot through the orientation parameters, which are calculated to produce the desired position.
