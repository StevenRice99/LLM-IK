I'll now solve the inverse kinematics problem for this 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the information from the forward kinematics tests.

From the DETAILS section and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
- TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint 2
- When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.425]

Looking at the tests:
1. When joint 1 = 1.57 (90°), the TCP rotates around the Z-axis
2. When joint 2 = 1.57 (90°), the Z coordinate rotates into the X coordinate

Let me complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 2 (rotates around Y-axis)
    # From z = 0.425 * cos(theta2)
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotates around Z-axis)
    # Using the relationship from the forward kinematics calculations
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    a = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    b = 0.01615
    
    # Using the linear system from forward kinematics equations:
    # x = a * cos(theta1) - b * sin(theta1)
    # y = a * sin(theta1) + b * cos(theta1)
    numerator = a * y - b * x
    denominator = a * x + b * y
    theta1 = math.atan2(numerator, denominator)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution handles the closed-form inverse kinematics by:
1. Computing θ2 directly from the z-coordinate
2. Solving a system of linear equations to find θ1 based on x, y, and the calculated θ2
