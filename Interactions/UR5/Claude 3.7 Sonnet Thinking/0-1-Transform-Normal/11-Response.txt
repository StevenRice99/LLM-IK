After analyzing the feedback, I need to completely revise my inverse kinematics solution. I need to properly account for the specific geometry of this robot and the relationship between joint values and end-effector pose.

Let me implement a more accurate solution:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Robot parameters from the description
    L1 = 0.13585  # Z-offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    L2 = 0.425    # Length of the second link
    d = 0.1197    # Y-offset of TCP from second link
    
    # Compute the IK solution
    
    # First determine the position of joint 2 (wrist) from desired TCP position and orientation
    # This requires understanding how the orientation affects the TCP position relative to joint 2
    
    # Extract rotation matrix from the orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)
    # For this specific robot with revolute joints around Z and Y:
    # - rx corresponds to roll
    # - ry corresponds to pitch
    # - rz corresponds to yaw
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot with joints around Z and Y, the orientation is directly related to joint angles
    # Joint 1 (Z-axis rotation) primarily affects rz
    # Joint 2 (Y-axis rotation) primarily affects ry
    
    # For this specific robot, we need to use the provided orientation to determine the correct solution
    # among the mathematically possible ones
    
    # Step 1: Calculate the squared distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Step 2: Determine joint 2 angle (theta2)
    # We need to account for the TCP offset from joint 2
    
    # The Z coordinate after accounting for first link height
    z_prime = z - L1
    
    # Using geometric approach to find theta2
    # We know that the effective reach of the arm is affected by both L2 and d (the y-offset)
    
    # Calculate the effective coordinates of the wrist (joint 2)
    # Since joint 2 rotates around Y-axis, the angle of this joint affects how the offset d translates
    # to the global coordinates
    
    # For determining theta2, we need to solve the constraint equation:
    # √(x² + y²) = L2*sin(theta2) - d*cos(theta2)
    # z' = L2*cos(theta2) + d*sin(theta2)
    
    # This gives us the quadratic equation:
    # (L2² + d²) - (√(x² + y²))² - (z')² = 2*(d*√(x² + y²) - L2*z')sin(theta2)
    
    D = L2**2 + d**2 - r_xy**2 - z_prime**2
    E = 2 * (d * r_xy - L2 * z_prime)
    
    # Avoid division by zero
    if abs(E) < 1e-10:
        if abs(D) < 1e-10:
            # Infinite solutions, choose theta2 = 0
            theta2 = 0
        else:
            # No solution, choose closest approximation
            theta2 = np.pi/2 if D > 0 else -np.pi/2
    else:
        # Calculate theta2
        sin_theta2 = D / E
        # Ensure within valid range for arcsin
        sin_theta2 = max(min(sin_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
        theta2 = np.arcsin(sin_theta2)
    
    # Step 3: Determine joint 1 angle (theta1)
    
    # For theta1, we need to consider how the arm is oriented in the XY plane
    # The base angle (phi) is the angle of the target in the XY plane
    phi = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # We also need to account for the effect of theta2 on the position
    # The angle adjustment (alpha) depends on how theta2 affects the TCP position
    
    # Calculate the offset angle
    # The effective reach in XY plane is affected by both theta2 and the offsets
    cos_theta2 = np.cos(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = np.sin(theta2)
    
    # Calculate the offset in the XY plane due to theta2
    effective_d = d * cos_theta2 - L2 * sin_theta2
    
    # Calculate theta1 considering the XY offset
    if abs(effective_d) < 1e-10:
        # No offset, theta1 is just the angle in XY plane
        theta1 = phi
    else:
        # Adjust theta1 based on the offset
        # The sign is negative because the offset works in the opposite direction
        offset_angle = np.arctan2(effective_d, 0)
        theta1 = phi - offset_angle
    
    # Determine the correct branch of the solution (multiple solutions exist)
    # We can use the orientation information to choose
    
    # For many inverse kinematics problems with multiple solutions,
    # the orientation helps determine which solution branch to use
    
    # Check if the resulting orientation matches the target
    # If not, try alternative solutions
    
    # Alternative solution: theta1 + π, -theta2 + π
    alt_theta1 = theta1 + np.pi
    alt_theta2 = np.pi - theta2
    
    # Normalize angles to [-π, π]
    while theta1 > np.pi: theta1 -= 2*np.pi
    while theta1 < -np.pi: theta1 += 2*np.pi
    while theta2 > np.pi: theta2 -= 2*np.pi
    while theta2 < -np.pi: theta2 += 2*np.pi
    
    while alt_theta1 > np.pi: alt_theta1 -= 2*np.pi
    while alt_theta1 < -np.pi: alt_theta1 += 2*np.pi
    while alt_theta2 > np.pi: alt_theta2 -= 2*np.pi
    while alt_theta2 < -np.pi: alt_theta2 += 2*np.pi
    
    # Use orientation information to choose between solutions
    # For this robot, rz is most closely related to theta1
    # and ry is most closely related to theta2
    
    # Calculate which solution better matches the desired orientation
    solution1_rz_diff = min(abs(rz - theta1), abs(rz - theta1 + 2*np.pi), abs(rz - theta1 - 2*np.pi))
    solution2_rz_diff = min(abs(rz - alt_theta1), abs(rz - alt_theta1 + 2*np.pi), abs(rz - alt_theta1 - 2*np.pi))
    
    # Choose the solution with the smaller difference in rz
    if solution1_rz_diff <= solution2_rz_diff:
        return (theta1, theta2)
    else:
        return (alt_theta1, alt_theta2)
```

This solution:

1. Takes a pure geometric approach to the inverse kinematics
2. Properly accounts for the arm structure, including the offset of the TCP from the second joint
3. Solves explicitly for the joint angles using the geometric constraints
4. Handles multiple solution branches and uses orientation information to select the correct one
5. Normalizes all angles to ensure they're within the expected range

The key insight is understanding the geometric relationship between the joint positions, joint angles, and the resulting TCP position, while using the orientation information to disambiguate between multiple possible solutions.
