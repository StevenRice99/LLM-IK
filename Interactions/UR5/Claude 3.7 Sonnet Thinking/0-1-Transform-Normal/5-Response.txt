I'll analyze the 2-DOF robot manipulator based on the provided information and the forward kinematics test results.

Looking at the test results:
1. When joints are at (0,0), the TCP is at [0, 0.016149999999999998, 0.425]
2. When joints are at (Ï€/2,0), the TCP is at [-0.016149999999999998, ~0, 0.425]

Let me derive the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint2 (rotates around Y-axis)
    # From z = 0.425*cos(theta2)
    theta2 = np.arccos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Solve for joint1 (rotates around Z-axis)
    # From our forward kinematics analysis:
    # x = 0.425*sin(theta2)*cos(theta1) - 0.016149*sin(theta1)
    # y = 0.425*sin(theta2)*sin(theta1) + 0.016149*cos(theta1)
    
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    phi = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # For all reachable positions (as stated in the problem)
    theta1 = phi - np.arcsin(0.016149 / r_xy)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution works by:
1. Directly calculating theta2 from the z-coordinate
2. Using trigonometric identities to solve for theta1 based on the x and y coordinates

The solution is analytically derived and works for all reachable positions as required.
