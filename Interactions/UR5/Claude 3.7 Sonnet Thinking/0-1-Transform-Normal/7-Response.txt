Based on the provided feedback, I need to revise my inverse kinematics solution. The issue is clearly related to how I'm handling joint configurations and orientation.

I'll implement a more robust solution that considers multiple possible configurations and selects the one that best matches the desired orientation:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # From the z-coordinate, we can calculate theta2
    # We need to handle both possible solutions: theta2 and -theta2 (or alternatively, pi-theta2)
    theta2_sol1 = np.arccos(min(max(z / 0.425, -1.0), 1.0))
    theta2_sol2 = -theta2_sol1
    
    # Calculate sin(theta2) for both solutions to use in theta1 calculation
    sin_theta2_1 = np.sin(theta2_sol1)
    sin_theta2_2 = np.sin(theta2_sol2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 for each theta2 solution
    # Using our derived inverse kinematics equation
    # When sin(theta2) is very small, we need special handling
    if abs(sin_theta2_1) < 1e-10:
        theta1_sol1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    else:
        theta1_sol1 = np.arctan2(y, x) - np.arctan2(0.01615, 0.425 * sin_theta2_1)
    
    if abs(sin_theta2_2) < 1e-10:
        theta1_sol2 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    else:
        theta1_sol2 = np.arctan2(y, x) - np.arctan2(0.01615, 0.425 * sin_theta2_2)
    
    # We also need to consider solutions with theta1 + pi to get all possible configurations
    theta1_sol3 = theta1_sol1 + np.pi
    theta1_sol4 = theta1_sol2 + np.pi
    
    # Generate all possible configurations
    configs = [
        (theta1_sol1, theta2_sol1),
        (theta1_sol2, theta2_sol2),
        (theta1_sol3, theta2_sol1),
        (theta1_sol4, theta2_sol2),
    ]
    
    # Function to compute orientation given joint angles
    def compute_orientation(theta1, theta2):
        # Compute roll (rx), pitch (ry), and yaw (rz) from joint angles
        R = np.array([
            [np.cos(theta1)*np.cos(theta2), -np.sin(theta1), np.cos(theta1)*np.sin(theta2)],
            [np.sin(theta1)*np.cos(theta2), np.cos(theta1), np.sin(theta1)*np.sin(theta2)],
            [-np.sin(theta2), 0, np.cos(theta2)]
        ])
        
        # Extract Euler angles from the rotation matrix
        pitch = np.arcsin(-R[0,2])
        if np.abs(np.cos(pitch)) < 1e-10:
            # Gimbal lock case
            roll = 0
            yaw = np.arctan2(-R[1,0], R[1,1])
        else:
            roll = np.arctan2(R[1,2], R[2,2])
            yaw = np.arctan2(R[0,1], R[0,0])
        
        return (roll, pitch, yaw)
    
    # Function to compute difference between orientations
    def orientation_difference(o1, o2):
        # Handle angle wrapping to find smallest angular difference
        diff = 0
        for a, b in zip(o1, o2):
            angle_diff = (a - b) % (2*np.pi)
            if angle_diff > np.pi:
                angle_diff = 2*np.pi - angle_diff
            diff += angle_diff**2
        return diff
    
    # Find the configuration that best matches the desired orientation
    best_config = None
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    for config in configs:
        theta1, theta2 = config
        
        # Normalize angles to be within the joint limits
        while theta1 > np.pi: theta1 -= 2*np.pi
        while theta1 < -np.pi: theta1 += 2*np.pi
        while theta2 > np.pi: theta2 -= 2*np.pi
        while theta2 < -np.pi: theta2 += 2*np.pi
        
        # Compute orientation for this configuration
        orientation = compute_orientation(theta1, theta2)
        
        # Calculate orientation difference
        diff = orientation_difference(orientation, r)
        
        # Check if this is better than our current best
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_config = (theta1, theta2)
    
    return best_config
```

This solution:
1. Calculates all possible joint configurations that can reach the target position
2. Computes the orientation that would result from each configuration
3. Selects the configuration that best matches the desired orientation
4. Handles special cases like gimbal lock and angles near zero
5. Properly normalizes angles to be within joint limits

The key insight is that for a given position, there are multiple joint configurations that can reach it, but they result in different orientations. We need to select the configuration that best matches both the position and orientation requirements.
