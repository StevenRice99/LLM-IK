I need to completely rethink my approach. Looking at the feedback, I notice I'm often getting positions with opposite signs and incorrect orientations. Let's create a more accurate inverse kinematics solution based on the robot's specific geometry.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from base to joint 2 along z
    l2 = 0.425    # Distance from joint 2 to TCP along local z
    offset_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of TCP from joint 2
    
    # Correct for the offset in the arm structure
    # The effective z is adjusted by the height of the first link
    z_adjusted = z - l1
    
    # Calculate theta2 (using the adjusted z)
    # We need arccos of z_adjusted/l2
    cos_theta2 = z_adjusted / l2
    # Clamp to valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # We have two possible solutions for theta2
    theta2_pos = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_neg = -theta2_pos
    
    # For each possible theta2, calculate the corresponding theta1
    # Using x = cos(theta1)*(l2*sin(theta2) + offset_y*cos(theta2)) - sin(theta1)*offset_y*sin(theta2)
    # and y = sin(theta1)*(l2*sin(theta2) + offset_y*cos(theta2)) + cos(theta1)*offset_y*sin(theta2)
    
    solutions = []
    
    for theta2 in [theta2_pos, theta2_neg]:
        # Calculate components for the trigonometric equations
        a = l2 * np.sin(theta2)
        b = offset_y
        
        # Calculate effective radius in xy-plane
        r_xy = np.sqrt(x*x + y*y)
        
        # Get angle in xy-plane
        phi = np.arctan2(y, x)
        
        # Calculate theta1 using the law of cosines and angle adjustments
        if abs(a) < 1e-10:  # Handle vertical arm case
            theta1 = phi
        else:
            # Calculate theta1 with offset consideration
            gamma = np.arctan2(b, a)
            theta1 = phi - gamma
        
        # Add both solutions: (theta1, theta2) and (theta1 + pi, -theta2)
        solutions.append((theta1, theta2))
        solutions.append((theta1 + np.pi, -theta2))
    
    # Normalize angles to be in range [-pi, pi]
    normalized_solutions = []
    for theta1, theta2 in solutions:
        while theta1 > np.pi: theta1 -= 2*np.pi
        while theta1 < -np.pi: theta1 += 2*np.pi
        while theta2 > np.pi: theta2 -= 2*np.pi
        while theta2 < -np.pi: theta2 += 2*np.pi
        normalized_solutions.append((theta1, theta2))
    
    # Choose the solution that best matches the desired orientation
    # For this robot, orientation is directly related to joint angles:
    # rx is approximately 0 or pi (depending on configuration)
    # ry is approximately theta2
    # rz is approximately theta1
    
    best_solution = None
    min_error = float('inf')
    
    for theta1, theta2 in normalized_solutions:
        # Check if rx matches (either 0 or pi)
        rx_error = min(abs(rx), abs(rx - np.pi), abs(rx + np.pi))
        
        # Check ry against theta2
        ry_error = min(abs(ry - theta2), abs(ry - theta2 + 2*np.pi), abs(ry - theta2 - 2*np.pi))
        
        # Check rz against theta1
        rz_error = min(abs(rz - theta1), abs(rz - theta1 + 2*np.pi), abs(rz - theta1 - 2*np.pi))

        total_error = rx_error + ry_error + rz_error

            min_error = total_error
            best_solution = (theta1, theta2)
    
    return best_solution
```

This solution:
1. Takes into account the correct geometry of the robot, including the offset between joint positions
2. Calculates multiple possible configurations (4 in total) that reach the desired position
3. Uses a better orientation matching mechanism that understands the relationship between joint angles and orientation
4. Properly normalizes all angles to avoid issues with angle wrapping

The key insight is understanding that for this specific robot, the orientation components relate directly to the joint angles, which simplifies the selection of the correct configuration from multiple possibilities.
