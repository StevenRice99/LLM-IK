After carefully analyzing the feedback and studying the test cases more deeply, I realize that we need to consider both the position and orientation when computing the inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the pattern of failed cases, I've identified that the sign of the z-coordinate of the position is crucial for determining how to handle the orientation. Here's my improved solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Check if z is negative (target is below the base)
    z_negative = z < 0
    
    # Check if rx is close to π or -π (indicating a "flipped" orientation)
    rx_is_pi = abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6
    
    if z_negative and rx_is_pi:
        # For targets below with flipped orientation, we need to invert the angles
        # Joint 2
        if ry > 0:
            theta2 = ry + (math.pi - 2*ry)
        else:
            theta2 = ry - (math.pi + 2*ry)
            
        # Joint 1
        if rx > 0:  # rx ≈ π
            if rz > 0:
                theta1 = -math.pi + rz
            else:
                theta1 = math.pi + rz
        else:  # rx ≈ -π
            if rz > 0:
                theta1 = -math.pi + rz
            else:
                theta1 = math.pi + rz
                
    else:
        # For normal cases, directly map orientation to joint angles
        theta1 = rz
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

However, after carefully analyzing the provided test cases and failures, I believe the answer is much simpler than I initially thought. Let me implement a more straightforward solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, determine if we need to account for flipped orientation (z < 0)
    if z < 0:
        # Joint angles for reaching positions with z < 0
        if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6:  # rx is close to π or -π
            if rx > 0:  # rx ≈ π
                theta1 = rz
                theta2 = math.pi - ry
            else:  # rx ≈ -π
                theta1 = rz
                theta2 = -math.pi - ry
                
            # Adjust theta1 by π
            if theta1 > 0:
                theta1 -= math.pi
            else:
                theta1 += math.pi
    else:
        # For regular positions (z ≥ 0)
        theta1 = rz
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
