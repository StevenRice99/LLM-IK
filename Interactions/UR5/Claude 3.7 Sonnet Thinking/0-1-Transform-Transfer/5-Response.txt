Based on the forward kinematics calls I've made, I can now implement the inverse kinematics solution that considers both position and orientation.

After analyzing the results from the forward kinematics tests, I notice a clear pattern:

1. When joints are at (0, 0), the TCP orientation is [0, 0, 0]
2. When joints are at (1.0, 0.5), the TCP orientation is [0, 0.5, 1]

This reveals a direct relationship between the joint angles and the orientation:
- The Z component of orientation (rz) corresponds to joint 1's angle
- The Y component of orientation (ry) corresponds to joint 2's angle
- The X component remains 0

Since I need to solve for both position and orientation, and the problem states that all targets will be reachable, I can use this relationship to implement the inverse kinematics solution.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target orientation
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint angles can be directly extracted from the orientation
    theta1 = rz  # Joint 1 (Z-axis rotation) corresponds to rz
    theta2 = ry  # Joint 2 (Y-axis rotation) corresponds to ry
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution leverages the direct relationship between the joint angles and the orientation components, providing a clean and efficient inverse kinematics solution for this specific 2-DOF robot configuration.
