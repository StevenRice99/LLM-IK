After analyzing the feedback and the provided test cases, I can now implement a correct inverse kinematics solution. Looking at the pattern of the failures, I notice that when the Z component of the position is negative (pointing downward), the orientation typically has rx ≈ π, and the joint values have a specific relationship with the orientation values.

Let me implement the corrected solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Check if rx is close to π, which indicates a "flipped" orientation
    is_flipped = abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6
    
    if is_flipped:
        # For a flipped orientation (rx ≈ π)
        theta1 = rz - math.pi
        theta2 = math.pi - ry
    else:
        # For a regular orientation (rx ≈ 0)
        theta1 = rz
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Normalize theta1 and theta2 to [-π, π]
    while theta1 > math.pi:
        theta1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while theta1 < -math.pi:
        theta1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    while theta2 > math.pi:
        theta2 -= 2 * math.pi
    while theta2 < -math.pi:
        theta2 += 2 * math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution correctly handles both normal and "flipped" orientations. When the robot needs to reach a position with the end-effector pointing downward (rx ≈ π), we need to make specific adjustments to the joint angles. The patterns observed in the test cases show that:

1. For normal orientation (rx ≈ 0):
   - theta1 = rz
   - theta2 = ry

2. For flipped orientation (rx ≈ π):
   - theta1 = rz - π
   - theta2 = π - ry

The normalization steps ensure all angles stay within the [-π, π] range.
