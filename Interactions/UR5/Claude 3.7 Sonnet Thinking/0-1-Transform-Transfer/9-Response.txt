I've analyzed the feedback from the previous attempts, and I've determined that my solution was handling the orientation correctly but needed refinement to account for the sign of rx in the orientation. 

Let's fix the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Check if rx is close to pi or -pi (indicating a "flipped" orientation)
    is_flipped = abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6
    
    if is_flipped:
        # For a "flipped" orientation (rx ≈ π or rx ≈ -π)
        if rz >= 0:
            theta1 = rz - math.pi
        else:
            theta1 = rz + math.pi
        
        if rx > 0:  # rx ≈ π
            theta2 = math.pi - ry
        else:  # rx ≈ -π
            theta2 = -math.pi - ry
    else:
        # For a "normal" orientation (rx ≈ 0)
        theta1 = rz
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Normalize theta1 and theta2 to [-π, π]
    theta1 = (theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    theta2 = (theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution accomplishes several key things:

1. It correctly identifies when the orientation is "flipped" (rx close to π or -π)
2. It handles different cases based on the sign of rx and rz
3. For flipped orientations, it adjusts the joint angles with specific formulas:
   - When rx ≈ π: θ1 = rz ± π and θ2 = π - ry
   - When rx ≈ -π: θ1 = rz ± π and θ2 = -π - ry
4. For normal orientations (rx ≈ 0), it uses the direct mapping θ1 = rz and θ2 = ry
5. It normalizes all angles to the range [-π, π]

This approach correctly handles the relationship between orientation and joint angles for this 2-DOF manipulator.
