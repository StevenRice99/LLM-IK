After analyzing the feedback carefully, I notice consistent patterns in the joint values. Let me fully revise my approach with a more comprehensive solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    return best_solution
```

This solution:

1. Tries both possible values for joint 1 (rz and rz±π) based on observed patterns
2. For each joint 1 value, transforms the target to joint 2's frame
3. Uses the law of cosines to find both possible joint 3 angles (elbow up/down)
4. Calculates joint 2 angles that satisfy the position constraint
5. Adjusts joint 2 to enforce the orientation constraint (joint2 + joint3 = ry, ry±π, or ry±2π)
6. Evaluates the quality of each solution based on position error
7. Returns the best solution found

This approach handles the different solution branches observed in the test cases and should provide more accurate inverse kinematics solutions.
