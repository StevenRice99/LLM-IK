Based on the forward kinematics results, I can now complete the inverse kinematics solution. I'll combine the approaches from the existing code samples to develop a comprehensive solution for all three joints.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """

    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x_target, y_target)
    
    # Transform target position to the frame after joint 1 rotation

        [c1, -s1, 0],
        [s1, c1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1]

    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    # Check if our solution is valid, if not try the other solution for joint 3
    if not (math.isclose(y_adj, -L2 * math.sin(theta2) - L3 * math.sin(theta2 + theta3), abs_tol=1e-5) and

This solution:
1. Calculates joint 1 using the atan2 function based on target x and y coordinates
2. Transforms the target position to the local frame after joint 1 rotation
3. Solves for joints 2 and 3 using the law of cosines and geometric relationships
4. Validates the solution and tries alternative solutions if needed
5. Considers the target orientation for final adjustments
