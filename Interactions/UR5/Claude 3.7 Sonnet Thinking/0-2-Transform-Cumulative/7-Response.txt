It appears my previous inverse kinematics solution has several issues. Let me revise it completely based on the feedback and test cases.

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This revised solution:

1. Calculates joint 1 based on target x and y coordinates
2. Transforms the target position to the frame after joint 1 rotation
3. Uses the law of cosines to calculate joint 3
4. Calculates joint 2 by considering the angle to the target and adjusting for joint 3
5. Validates potential solutions by checking forward kinematics
6. Handles orientation constraints by adjusting joint angles accordingly
7. Normalizes angles to be within standard ranges

The approach takes into account the specific robot geometry and considers multiple possible solutions, selecting the most appropriate one based on the target position and orientation.
