After analyzing the feedback and the correct joint values, I need to completely revise my approach. There appears to be a more direct relationship between the orientation parameters and joint angles than I initially thought.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This revised solution takes a different approach:

1. Joint 1 (theta1) is set equal to the rz orientation value, as this is the direct relationship observed in the correct solutions.

2. For joints 2 and 3, I use two complementary methods:
   - First, I solve for the position using the law of cosines and check if the resulting orientation matches ry
   - If that fails, I try setting theta2 + theta3 = ry and check how close that gets to the target position

3. In both cases, I evaluate potential solutions based on their error (either orientation error or position error) and choose the best one.

The robot's kinematics show that joint 1 controls the heading (rz), while joints 2 and 3 work together to reach the target position while maintaining the desired pitch (ry).
