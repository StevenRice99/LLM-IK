After carefully analyzing the correct solutions from the feedback, I see a clear pattern in how the joint angles relate to the orientation. I need to implement two possible solution branches based on this insight:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

Wait, I'm making this too complicated and introducing errors. Let me fix it with a simpler, more reliable approach:
