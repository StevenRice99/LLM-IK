Based on the forward kinematics results, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Looking at the robot structure and the provided test cases, I understand that:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis, affecting the X-Y position
2. Joints 2 and 3 rotate around the Y-axis, mainly affecting the X-Z position in the rotated frame
3. I need to combine both existing solutions to handle the full 3-DOF chain

Let me complete the inverse kinematics method:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This solution:
1. First solves for joint 1 angle using the target position's X-Y coordinates
2. Transforms the target position into the reference frame after joint 1 rotation
3. Computes the desired orientation after joint 1 rotation
4. Calculates the sum of joint 2 and 3 angles needed for orientation
5. Uses geometric approach to solve for joint 2 and 3 angles that satisfy both position and orientation
