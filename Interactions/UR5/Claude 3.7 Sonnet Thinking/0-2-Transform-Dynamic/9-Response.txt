After analyzing the feedback patterns, I notice that in most cases, the correct theta1 value matches the rz component of the orientation. This insight suggests a direct relationship between joint 1 and the z-rotation in the target orientation. Let me improve my solution:

Hmm, I realize this solution still doesn't properly account for the orientation constraints and link offsets. Let me simplify and create a more accurate solution:

```python

After further thought, I realize this problem requires a more precise geometric approach. Let me finalize the solution:

Wait, this still doesn't properly handle all the geometric constraints. Let me make one final correction with the correct approach:
