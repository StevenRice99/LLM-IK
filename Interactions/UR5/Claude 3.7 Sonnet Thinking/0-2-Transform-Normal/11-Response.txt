Thanks for the feedback. I can see my solution had significant issues with joint angle calculations and configuration selection. Let me develop a more comprehensive inverse kinematics solution that properly handles all the cases.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract position components
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    L2 = 0.425    # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    # For most cases, the base rotation will align with the target position
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # If orientation indicates a different configuration, we may need to flip by ±π
    # Check if the orientation's z component (rz) suggests a different base rotation
    if abs(rz) > 0.1:  # If there's a significant orientation around z
        # If the difference between theta1 and rz is more than π/2, adjust theta1
        if abs(theta1 - rz) > math.pi/2 and abs(theta1 - rz) < 3*math.pi/2:
            if theta1 < rz:
                theta1 += math.pi
            else:
                theta1 -= math.pi
    
    # Transform target point to the 2D plane after rotation by theta1
    r_target = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_target = z - L1  # Height relative to joint 2
    
    # Calculate distance from joint 2 to target
    D = math.sqrt(r_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    # L2 + L3 is the maximum reach of the arm
    if D > L2 + L3:
        D = L2 + L3  # Clamp to maximum reach
    
    # Use the law of cosines to calculate the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3 (elbow up/down)
    # Determine which configuration to use based on the orientation
    if ry < 0:
        theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Elbow down config
    else:
        theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)   # Elbow up config
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines
    # First, get the angle between the line from joint 2 to target and the horizontal
    phi = math.atan2(z_target, r_target)
    
    # Then get the angle between the line from joint 2 to joint 3 and the line from joint 2 to target
    psi = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(abs(theta3)), L2 + L3 * cos_theta3)
    
    # Compute theta2
    if theta3 >= 0:
        theta2 = phi - psi
    else:
        theta2 = phi + psi
    
    # Special cases and adjustments based on target orientation
    # If target is above the robot and ry indicates a flip
    if z_target > 0 and ry < -0.5:
        theta2 = -theta2
        theta3 = -theta3
    
    # If theta1 is close to ±π, check if we should flip base rotation
    if abs(abs(theta1) - math.pi) < 0.1 and rz < -1.0:
        theta1 = -theta1
    
    # Check if orientation suggests we should be reaching backward
    if abs(ry) > 1.2 and z_target < 0:
        if theta2 > 0:
            theta2 = math.pi - theta2
        else:
            theta2 = -math.pi - theta2
    
    # Normalize angles to [-π, π] range
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta3 = ((theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This improved solution:

1. Calculates the base rotation (theta1) and considers orientation to select the correct quadrant
2. Handles multiple arm configurations (elbow up/down) based on the target orientation
3. Makes adjustments for special cases (reaching backward, targets above the robot)
4. Normalizes all angles to ensure they're in the expected range

The solution considers the orientation input to select the most appropriate arm configuration to match both position and orientation as closely as possible with the 3 available DOF.
