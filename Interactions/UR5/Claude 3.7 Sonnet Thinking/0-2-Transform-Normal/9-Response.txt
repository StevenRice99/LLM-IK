I'll analyze the robot arm's structure based on the details and FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests to develop an inverse kinematics solution.

From the FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests, I can see:
- When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
- Joint 1 rotates around Z axis (changes x,y coordinates)
- Joint 2 rotates around Y axis (when set to 1.57, arm extends forward horizontally)
- Joint 3 rotates around Y axis (when set to 1.57, forearm bends forward)

Let me derive a closed-form inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract position components
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the URDF
    L2 = 0.425  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-component)
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    h = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform to r-z plane (r is the distance from z-axis)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_rel = z - h  # Height relative to joint 2
    
    # Apply 2-link planar arm inverse kinematics
    d_squared = r**2 + z_rel**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is in valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Compute theta3 (elbow angle)
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2), cos_theta3)
    
    # Compute theta2 (shoulder angle)
    beta = math.atan2(r, z_rel)
    gamma = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates θ₁ directly from the target x,y coordinates
2. Transforms the problem to the r-z plane (after θ₁ rotation)
3. Uses the standard 2-link manipulator inverse kinematics to calculate θ₂ and θ₃
4. Handles position constraints by using the law of cosines and appropriate transformations

The solution assumes all targets are reachable as specified in the instructions.
