Based on the feedback and test cases, I see that my previous approaches were not correctly handling the relationship between position and orientation constraints. Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis and directly corresponds to rz component of orientation
    θ1 = rz
    
    # Constants - robot dimensions
    d2 = 0.13585    # Offset in Y from joint 1 to joint 2
    d3 = -0.1197    # Offset in Y from joint 2 to joint 3
    a2 = 0.425      # Length of link 2 in Z direction
    a3 = 0.39225    # Length of link 3 in Z direction
    
    # Transform target position to frame after θ1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(θ1), math.sin(θ1)
    x_1 = x * c1 + y * s1
    y_1 = -x * s1 + y * c1
    z_1 = z
    
    # The Y component of orientation (ry) is the sum of θ2 and θ3 in this robot
    # Therefore θ2 + θ3 = ry
    # We'll use this constraint along with the position equations to solve for θ2 and θ3
    
    # First, adjust the target position by subtracting the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_1_adj = y_1 - d2
    
    # Now we need to solve for θ2 and θ3 given:
    # 1. The position constraint (the end effector must reach the target)
    # 2. The orientation constraint (θ2 + θ3 = ry)
    
    # We can use the position equations:
    # x_end = a2*sin(θ2) + (a3*sin(θ2+θ3) + d3*cos(θ2+θ3))
    # y_end = d3*sin(θ2+θ3) - a3*cos(θ2+θ3) - a2*cos(θ2)
    
    # Substituting θ3 = ry - θ2 into these equations gives us a single equation in θ2
    
    # Let's try a different approach using a known orientation constraint
    # If we know θ2 + θ3 = ry, we can solve for θ2 and θ3 using the position constraint
    
    def forward_position(θ2, θ3):
        # Calculate end effector position given θ2 and θ3
        s2, c2 = math.sin(θ2), math.cos(θ2)
        s23, c23 = math.sin(θ2 + θ3), math.cos(θ2 + θ3)
        
        x_end = a2 * s2 + a3 * s23 + d3 * c23
        z_end = a2 * c2 + a3 * c23 - d3 * s23
        
        return x_end, z_end
    
    # We'll try different values of θ2 and compute θ3 = ry - θ2
    # Then check which combination gives a position closest to the target
    
    best_error = float('inf')
    best_solution = None
    
    # Try different values of θ2 in a reasonable range
    # For more precision, we could use a numerical solver
    num_samples = 1000
    θ2_range = (-math.pi, math.pi)
    
    for i in range(num_samples):
        θ2 = θ2_range[0] + (θ2_range[1] - θ2_range[0]) * i / (num_samples - 1)
        θ3 = ry - θ2
        
        # Check if this combination reaches the target position
        x_calc, z_calc = forward_position(θ2, θ3)
        
        # Calculate error as distance from calculated position to target
        position_error = (x_calc - x_1)**2 + (z_calc - z_1_adj)**2
        
        if position_error < best_error:
            best_error = position_error
            best_solution = (θ1, θ2, θ3)
    
    return best_solution
```

Wait, there's an issue with the approach above. Let me refine it:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1 (revolves around Z-axis)
    θ1 = rz
    
    # Transform target position to frame after θ1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(θ1), math.sin(θ1)
    x_1 = x * c1 + y * s1
    y_1 = -x * s1 + y * c1
    z_1 = z
    
    # Robot dimensions
    d2 = 0.13585    # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    d3 = -0.1197    # Y offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    a2 = 0.425      # Length of link 2
    a3 = 0.39225    # Length of link 3
    
    # For our 3-DOF robot with specific orientation, we have the constraint:
    # θ2 + θ3 = ry
    
    # Calculate θ3 directly
    θ3 = math.asin((x_1**2 + (z_1 - d2)**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3))
    
    # Calculate θ2 based on position and θ3
    k1 = a2 + a3 * math.cos(θ3)
    k2 = a3 * math.sin(θ3)
    
    θ2 = math.atan2(x_1, z_1 - d2) - math.atan2(k2, k1)
    
    # Check if our solution satisfies the orientation constraint
    # If not, try the other solution for θ3
    if abs((θ2 + θ3) - ry) > 0.01:
        θ3 = math.pi - θ3
        k1 = a2 + a3 * math.cos(θ3)
        k2 = a3 * math.sin(θ3)
        θ2 = math.atan2(x_1, z_1 - d2) - math.atan2(k2, k1)
    
    # Final adjustment to match the orientation constraint exactly
    θ_adjustment = ry - (θ2 + θ3)
    θ2 += θ_adjustment / 2
    θ3 += θ_adjustment / 2
    
    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

I realize there's still an issue with this approach. Let me develop a proper analytical solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1 is directly determined by rz
    θ1 = rz
    
    # Transform target position to joint 1 frame
    c1, s1 = math.cos(θ1), math.sin(θ1)
    x_1 = x * c1 + y * s1
    y_1 = -x * s1 + y * c1
    z_1 = z
    
    # Robot dimensions
    d2 = 0.13585    # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    d3 = -0.1197    # Y offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    a2 = 0.425      # Length of link 2
    a3 = 0.39225    # Length of link 3
    
    # Orientation constraint: θ2 + θ3 = ry
    θ23 = ry  # Combined angle of joints 2 and 3
    
    # Given the orientation constraint and target position, solve for θ2 and θ3
    
    # First, calculate the wrist position (where joint 3 connects to the end effector)
    # The wrist position is offset from the target position by the end effector length
    # in the direction determined by the orientation
    
    c23, s23 = math.cos(θ23), math.sin(θ23)
    
    # The end effector extends a3 units along its local z-axis
    # In the base frame, this is:
    # [x_wrist, y_wrist, z_wrist] = [x, y, z] - a3 * [s23, 0, c23]
    
    x_wrist = x_1 - a3 * s23
    z_wrist = z_1 - a3 * c23
    y_wrist = y_1 - d3 * s23  # Account for y-offset in link 3
    
    # Now, using the position of the wrist, we can solve for θ2
    # The wrist is at position [0, d2, 0] + a2 * [s2, 0, c2] relative to joint 2
    
    # Adjust for the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_wrist -= d2
    
    # Calculate distance from joint 2 to wrist
    r = math.sqrt(x_wrist**2 + z_wrist**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if r > a2:
        # Target is too far, use closest possible solution
        θ2 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist)
    else:
        # Calculate θ2 using geometry
        θ2 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist) - math.asin(0)  # Adjust if needed
    
    # Calculate θ3 from the orientation constraint
    θ3 = θ23 - θ2
    
    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

I see I'm still not getting it right. Let me try a different approach that builds on the existing position-only solution and incorporates the orientation constraint:
