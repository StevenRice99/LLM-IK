Based on the forward kinematics results, I can see that:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis

Looking at the test case with joint values (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), I notice that the orientation values [~0, 1, 0.5] have a direct relationship to the joint angles. Specifically:
- The z-component (0.5) matches joint 1's value
- The y-component (1) appears to be the sum of joints 2 and 3 (0.5 + 0.5)

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function to account for both position and orientation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
