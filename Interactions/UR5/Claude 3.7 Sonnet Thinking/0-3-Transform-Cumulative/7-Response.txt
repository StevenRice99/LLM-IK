I need to revise my solution completely based on the correct answers. Let me analyze the pattern in the correct solutions and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solver.

```python

    tcp_offset = 0.093  # TCP offset in y direction
    
    # For this robot, joint 1 (base rotation) is directly related to the yaw
    # This is a key insight from analyzing the correct answers

    return solutions[0]
```

Wait, I think I'm still not fully understanding the correct mathematical relationship from the examples. Let me revise one more time:
