Looking carefully at the robot kinematics and studying the correct joint values, I've identified where my previous approach went wrong. I need to implement a solution that properly handles the orientation constraints. Here's a completely revised solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

```

This solution:

1. Sets joint 1 equal to the yaw angle from the input orientation
2. Creates a proper rotation matrix for the target orientation
3. Extracts the target orientation sum constraint from the rotation matrix
4. Accounts for the TCP offset in the joint 1 frame
5. Solves the planar manipulator inverse kinematics for joints 2, 3, and 4
6. Uses the same approach as in EXISTING 2 to ensure the sum of joint angles matches the target orientation
7. Selects the solution with minimum position and orientation error

The key insight was understanding that joint 1 should be set to the yaw angle, and the target orientation sum (derived from the rotation matrix) constrains the sum of joints 2, 3, and 4.
