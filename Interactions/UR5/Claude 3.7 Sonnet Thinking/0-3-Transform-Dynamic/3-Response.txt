I'll complete the inverse kinematics method by combining the approach from both existing solutions. The first solution handles joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis), and the second solution can be adapted for joints 2-4 (all rotating around Y-axis).

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    # Step 1: Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation

This solution:
1. First calculates joint 1 to align with the target in the XY plane (rotating around Z-axis)
2. Transforms the target position and orientation to the frame after joint 1 rotation
3. Accounts for the offset of joint 2 from joint 1
4. Factors in the TCP offset when determining the position for joint 4
5. Solves the 3-joint planar manipulator problem for joints 2, 3, and 4 (all rotating around Y-axis)
6. Selects the optimal solution with minimal joint movement

The approach addresses all the kinematic details in the robot's structure while ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation.
