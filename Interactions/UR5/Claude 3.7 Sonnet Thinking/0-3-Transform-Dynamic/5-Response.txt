Based on the feedback, I need to improve my inverse kinematics solution. I'll analyze the robot geometry more carefully and develop a complete solution that properly handles all joints.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This solution:

1. Uses the target orientation (yaw) to determine joint 1
2. Calculates the wrist position by subtracting the TCP offset along the y-axis of the end-effector frame
3. Transforms the wrist position to the frame after joint 1 rotation
4. Solves the planar manipulator problem for joints 2, 3, and 4 in the YZ plane
5. Uses the pitch value to constrain the sum of joints 2, 3, and 4
6. Considers alternative configurations by potentially flipping joint 1 by ±π
7. Chooses the solution with minimum joint movement

This approach properly accounts for the robot's kinematic structure and the coordinate frames of each joint.
