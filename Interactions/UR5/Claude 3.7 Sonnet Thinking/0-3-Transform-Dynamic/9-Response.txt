After analyzing the feedback and examining the correct joint values, I'm going to implement a revised solution that directly addresses the robot's kinematic structure:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    # Robot dimensions
    l1_y = 0.13585        # Joint 2 Y offset from Joint 1
    l2_y = -0.1197        # Joint 3 Y offset from Joint 2
    l2_z = 0.425          # Joint 3 Z offset from Joint 2
    l3_z = 0.39225        # Joint 4 Z offset from Joint 3
    tcp_y = 0.093         # TCP Y offset from Joint 4
    
    # Target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Step 1: Set Joint 1 = yaw from the orientation
    theta1 = yaw
    
    # Step 2: Transform target to Joint 1 frame
    c1, s1 = np.cos(theta1), np.sin(theta1)
    R1 = np.array([
        [c1, s1, 0],
        [-s1, c1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Position in Joint 1 frame
    p1 = R1 @ np.array([x, y, z])
    
    # Calculate rotation matrix for target orientation
    c_r, s_r = np.cos(roll), np.sin(roll)
    c_p, s_p = np.cos(pitch), np.sin(pitch)
    c_y, s_y = np.cos(yaw), np.sin(yaw)
    
    Rx = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, c_r, -s_r], [0, s_r, c_r]])
    Ry = np.array([[c_p, 0, s_p], [0, 1, 0], [-s_p, 0, c_p]])
    Rz = np.array([[c_y, -s_y, 0], [s_y, c_y, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    
    R_target = Rz @ Ry @ Rx
    
    # Target orientation in Joint 1 frame
    R1_target = R1 @ R_target
    
    # Step 3: Account for TCP offset
    # The TCP offset is along the Y-axis of the TCP frame
    tcp_offset = R1_target @ np.array([0, tcp_y, 0])
    
    # Wrist position (Joint 4) in Joint 1 frame
    wrist = p1 - tcp_offset
    
    # Step 4: Now we have a 3-joint planar manipulator problem
    # Adjust for Joint 2 offset from Joint 1
    wrist[1] -= l1_y
    
    # The effective lengths of the links
    l2 = np.sqrt(l2_y**2 + l2_z**2)  # Effective length from Joint 2 to 3
    l3 = l3_z                        # Length from Joint 3 to 4
    
    # The angle offset of link 2 due to Y offset
    phi2 = np.arctan2(l2_z, l2_y)
    
    # Distance to wrist from Joint 2
    d = np.sqrt(wrist[1]**2 + wrist[2]**2)
    
    # Use cosine law to find Joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Two possible solutions for Joint 3
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    theta3_alt = -theta3
    
    # Calculate Joint 2 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(wrist[1], wrist[2])
    gamma = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    gamma_alt = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3_alt), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3_alt))
    theta2_alt = beta - gamma_alt
    
    # Step 5: Calculate Joint 4 to achieve the desired orientation
    # Extract the Z-axis of the target orientation in Joint 1 frame
    z_axis = R1_target[:, 2]
    
    # Angle of Z-axis in the YZ plane
    target_angle = np.arctan2(z_axis[1], z_axis[2])
    
    # Joint 4 angle to achieve the desired orientation
    theta4 = target_angle - theta2 - theta3
    theta4_alt = target_angle - theta2_alt - theta3_alt
    
    # Normalize angles to [-π, π]
    def normalize_angle(angle):
        return ((angle + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    # Apply corrections for the robot's specific geometry
    # Based on the correct joint values from feedback
    
    # Joint 1 is already correct (theta1 = yaw)
    
    # Joint 2 needs an angle correction due to the link configuration
    theta2 = normalize_angle(theta2 - phi2)  # Subtract the offset angle
    theta2_alt = normalize_angle(theta2_alt - phi2)
    
    # Normalize all angles
    theta1 = normalize_angle(theta1)
    theta3 = normalize_angle(theta3)
    theta4 = normalize_angle(theta4)
    
    theta3_alt = normalize_angle(theta3_alt)
    theta4_alt = normalize_angle(theta4_alt)
    
    # Step 6: Choose the solution with minimal joint movement
    # Create two possible solutions
    solution1 = (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
    solution2 = (theta1, theta2_alt, theta3_alt, theta4_alt)
    
    # Select the solution with the minimum sum of absolute joint values
    if sum(abs(angle) for angle in solution1) <= sum(abs(angle) for angle in solution2):
        return solution1
    else:
        return solution2
```

This solution has several key improvements:

1. Joint 1 is directly set to the yaw value, which seems to be the correct approach based on the feedback
2. The transformations between frames are more carefully handled
3. The TCP offset is correctly applied in the end-effector frame
4. The kinematics for the planar manipulator (joints 2-4) are solved with proper geometric relationships
5. The link angle offset is accounted for in joint 2
6. Two possible solutions (elbow up/down configurations) are considered and the one with minimal joint movement is selected

This solution properly takes into account the robot's specific geometry and should correctly solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator.
