Looking at the feedback, I can see my inverse kinematics solution has significant issues. I'll develop a more accurate solution based on analyzing the failed test cases.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

```

The key improvements in this revised solution:

1. Properly handles the TCP offset based on the target orientation
2. Considers both possible solutions for joint 1 (θ₁ and θ₁±π)
3. Calculates two solutions for each configuration (elbow up and elbow down)
4. Handles edge cases more robustly
5. Uses a more accurate approach for calculating joint angles based on the robot's geometry

This solution should better handle the variety of target positions and orientations in the test cases.
