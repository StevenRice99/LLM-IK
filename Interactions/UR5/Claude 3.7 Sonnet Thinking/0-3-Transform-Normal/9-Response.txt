Based on the robot details and the forward kinematics tests, I'll develop a solution for the inverse kinematics of this 4-DOF serial manipulator.

Looking at the test cases, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis and controls the orientation in the XY plane
2. Joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate around Y-axis and determine the position in the resulting plane

I'll now complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Robot dimensions
    l1 = 0.13585  # Joint 1 to Joint 2 in y-axis
    l2_y = -0.1197  # y-component of Joint 2 to Joint 3
    l2_z = 0.425   # z-component of Joint 2 to Joint 3
    l3 = 0.39225   # Joint 3 to Joint 4 in z-axis
    l4 = 0.093     # Joint 4 to TCP in y-axis
    
    # Step 1: Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Z)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(py, px)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target point into the YZ plane after rotation by theta1
    r_distance = np.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)  # Distance from z-axis to target in XY plane
    
    # Step 3: Compute the position of the wrist (Joint 4) from TCP
    # TCP is offset from Joint 4 by [0, 0.093, 0] in local frame
    # We need to account for this offset
    wrist_y = r_distance - l4 * np.cos(ry)
    wrist_z = pz - l4 * np.sin(ry)
    
    # Step 4: Solve the inverse kinematics for a planar 3R manipulator
    # Using the law of cosines for the joint angles 2 and 3
    
    # Distance from Joint 2 to wrist
    wrist_to_j2_y = wrist_y - l1
    wrist_to_j2_distance = np.sqrt(wrist_to_j2_y**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle using law of cosines
    # cos(theta3) = (L2^2 + L3^2 - D^2) / (2*L2*L3)
    l2 = np.sqrt(l2_y**2 + l2_z**2)
    cos_theta3 = (l2**2 + l3**2 - wrist_to_j2_distance**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical issues
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # First, get the angle between the y-axis and the line from J2 to wrist
    psi = np.arctan2(wrist_z, wrist_to_j2_y)
    # Second, get the angle between the line from J2 to J3 and the line from J2 to wrist
    phi = np.arccos((l2**2 + wrist_to_j2_distance**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * wrist_to_j2_distance))
    # Adjust for the offset angle of the J2-J3 link from the y-axis
    offset_angle = np.arctan2(l2_z, -l2_y)
    theta2 = psi - phi - offset_angle
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle
    # The sum of joint angles 2, 3, and 4 must match the desired orientation (ry)
    theta4 = ry - theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates theta1 based on the target position in the XY plane
2. Transforms the target to find its distance from the Z-axis
3. Accounts for the TCP offset to find the wrist position
4. Uses the law of cosines to solve for theta2 and theta3
5. Derives theta4 from the orientation constraint
6. Returns all joint angles in radians
