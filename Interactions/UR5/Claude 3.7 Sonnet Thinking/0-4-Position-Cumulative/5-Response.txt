Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 5-DOF manipulator. I see that:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis at the base
2. Joints 2, 3, and 4 rotate around the Y-axis 
3. Joint 5 rotates around the Z-axis
4. The TCP has an offset of [0, 0, 0.09465] from the last joint

I'll complete the inverse kinematics function that solves for all 5 joint angles:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths from the URDF
    L1 = 0.425       # Joint 2 to 3 z-component
    L2 = 0.39225     # Joint 3 to 4 z-component
    L3 = 0.09465     # Joint 5 to TCP z-component
    offset_y_j2 = 0.13585  # y-offset of joint 2
    offset_y_j3 = -0.1197  # y-offset from joint 2 to 3
    offset_y_j5 = 0.093    # y-offset of joint 5
    
    # Calculate total y-offset in the chain
    y_offset = offset_y_j2 + offset_y_j3 + offset_y_j5
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target position to account for joint 1 rotation
    # We need to find the wrist center (position before the final joint and TCP offset)
    wrist_center_x = x - L3 * math.sin(theta1)
    wrist_center_y = y - L3 * math.cos(theta1)
    wrist_center_z = z
    
    # Project the wrist center into the plane defined by joints 2, 3, and 4
    # This is the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center in the joint 2-3-4 plane
    r = math.sqrt(wrist_center_x**2 + (wrist_center_y - y_offset)**2)
    s = wrist_center_z - offset_y_j2 - offset_y_j3
    
    # Now we solve the 2R problem for joints 2 and 3
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Choose the elbow down configuration (more natural)
    # Calculate theta2 based on theta3
    beta = math.atan2(s, r)
    psi = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - psi
    
    # Joint 4 compensates to keep the end effector horizontal
    # In this 5-DOF setup, joint 4 affects the TCP orientation 
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # Joint 5 rotates around the Z-axis at the wrist
    # Since it doesn't affect position, we can set it to zero or any desired orientation
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-pi, pi]
    def normalize(angle):
        while angle > math.pi:
            angle -= 2 * math.pi
        while angle < -math.pi:
            angle += 2 * math.pi
        return angle
    
    theta1 = normalize(theta1)
    theta2 = normalize(theta2)
    theta3 = normalize(theta3)
    theta4 = normalize(theta4)
    theta5 = normalize(theta5)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I see some issues with my implementation. The coordinate system transformations aren't quite right. Let me revise this solution.
