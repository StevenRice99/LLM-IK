Based on the feedback, I can see that my initial approach had several issues. Let me develop a better inverse kinematics solution that correctly handles the robot's kinematic structure.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the URDF
    # Link offsets
    J1_to_J2_y = 0.13585
    J2_to_J3_y = -0.1197
    J2_to_J3_z = 0.425
    J3_to_J4_z = 0.39225
    J4_to_J5_y = 0.093
    J5_to_TCP_z = 0.09465
    
    # We'll first determine the position of the wrist center (joint 5)
    # by subtracting the TCP offset from the target position
    # Since joint 5 rotates around Z, it doesn't affect the TCP position for a fixed joint 5 angle
    # For now we'll set joint 5 = 0, as this doesn't affect the position
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    # First we need to find the wrist center (joint 4 position)
    # We know that the TCP is offset by [0, 0, J5_to_TCP_z] from joint 5 in local coordinates
    # We need to account for both the J4_to_J5_y and J5_to_TCP_z offsets
    
    # Calculate squared distance from the base to the target point in the XY plane
    xy_dist_squared = x**2 + y**2
    
    # Total offset in y direction from joint 1 to TCP
    y_offset = J1_to_J2_y + J2_to_J3_y + J4_to_J5_y
    
    # First solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate distance from joint 2 to the target in the rotated plane
    # This is the plane containing joints 2, 3, 4 and the target
    r_target = math.sqrt(xy_dist_squared) - y_offset  # Distance in the XY plane adjusted for Y offset
    
    # Now we solve the position for joints 2, 3, and 4 as a three-link planar manipulator
    # First, we compute the wrist position (position of joint 4)
    # The position of joint 4 is offset from the TCP by the last link length
    wrist_x = x - J5_to_TCP_z * math.sin(theta1)
    wrist_y = y - J5_to_TCP_z * math.cos(theta1)
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Now calculate the planar distance from joint 2 to the wrist in the rotated frame
    r_wrist = math.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_y**2) - y_offset
    s_wrist = wrist_z - J1_to_J2_y
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    D = math.sqrt(r_wrist**2 + s_wrist**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - J2_to_J3_z**2 - J3_to_J4_z**2) / (2 * J2_to_J3_z * J3_to_J4_z)
    
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Using negative for elbow down configuration
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and the known theta3
    beta = math.atan2(s_wrist, r_wrist)
    
    # Calculate the angle gamma using the law of sines
    sin_gamma = (J3_to_J4_z * math.sin(-theta3)) / D
    gamma = math.asin(sin_gamma)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Calculate theta4 to keep the end effector at the desired orientation
    # In this case, we want to make joint 4 compensate for joints 2 and 3
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    # Normalize angles to be in the range [-pi, pi]
    def normalize_angle(angle):
        while angle > math.pi:
            angle -= 2 * math.pi
        while angle < -math.pi:
            angle += 2 * math.pi
        return angle
    
    theta1 = normalize_angle(theta1)
    theta2 = normalize_angle(theta2)
    theta3 = normalize_angle(theta3)
    theta4 = normalize_angle(theta4)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I notice that my implementation still has issues with the geometry calculations. Let me revise this solution once more:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

    # First, we'll solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Since joint 5 doesn't affect the TCP position when set to a fixed angle,
    # we'll work backward from the target to find the wrist center
    # The wrist center is the position of joint 4
    
    # Calculate the wrist center by removing the effect of the last link
    wrist_x = x - J5_to_TCP_z * math.sin(theta1)

    alpha = math.atan2(r_adj, s)
    
    # Then find the angle between the first link and the line from joint 2 to the wrist
    sin_beta = (L2 * math.sin(-theta3)) / D
    beta = math.asin(sin_beta)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta4 to achieve the desired orientation

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

I'm still not fully confident in this solution, as the robot's geometry is complex. Let me provide a properly corrected version that addresses all the feedback issues:
