Looking at the forward kinematics test results, I can see how the joint angles affect the position of the robot. I need to develop a solution for the inverse kinematics that can calculate all 5 joint angles to reach a given position.

Based on the test results and the robot information provided, I'll implement a solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot dimensions
    L1 = 0.425       # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L2 = 0.39225     # Z offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    L3 = 0.09465     # Z offset from joint 5 to TCP
    
    # Y offsets
    j1_to_j2_y = 0.13585
    j2_to_j3_y = -0.1197
    j4_to_j5_y = 0.093
    Y_OFFSET = j1_to_j2_y + j2_to_j3_y + j4_to_j5_y  # Should equal 0.10915
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the TCP offset
    z_adj = z - L3
    
    # Step 1: Calculate joint 3 using the law of cosines
    numerator = x**2 + y**2 + z_adj**2 - L1**2 - L2**2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * L2
    cos_q3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure valid cosine value
    q3 = -np.arccos(cos_q3)  # Negative for elbow-down configuration
    
    # Step 2: Calculate intermediate values for joint 2
    A = L1 + L2 * np.cos(q3)
    B = L2 * np.sin(q3)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the projection onto XY plane adjusted for Y offset
    S_squared = x**2 + y**2 - Y_OFFSET**2
    S = np.sqrt(S_squared) if S_squared >= 0 else 0.0
    C = z_adj
    
    # Step 4: Calculate joint 2
    numerator_q2 = S * A - C * B
    denominator_q2 = S * B + C * A
    q2 = np.arctan2(numerator_q2, denominator_q2)
    
    # Step 5: Calculate joint 1
    phi = np.arctan2(Y_OFFSET, S) if S != 0 else np.pi / 2
    q1 = np.arctan2(y, x) - phi
    
    # Step 6: Calculate joint 4 to maintain end effector orientation
    q4 = -(q2 + q3)
    
    # Step 7: Joint 5 doesn't affect position, so set it to 0
    q5 = 0.0
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    def normalize_angle(angle):
        return ((angle + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    q1 = normalize_angle(q1)
    q2 = normalize_angle(q2)
    q3 = normalize_angle(q3)
    q4 = normalize_angle(q4)
    
    return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
```

This solution follows these steps:
1. Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
2. Calculate joint 3 (q3) using the law of cosines, choosing the negative arccos value for the elbow-down configuration
3. Calculate intermediate values A and B for determining joint 2
4. Calculate S, the projection onto the XY plane adjusted for the Y offset
5. Calculate joint 2 (q2) using the intermediate values and projections
6. Calculate joint 1 (q1) by accounting for the Y offset in the chain
7. Calculate joint 4 (q4) to compensate for joints 2 and 3 to maintain end effector orientation
8. Set joint 5 (q5) to 0 since it doesn't affect position
9. Normalize all angles to be within the range [-π, π]
