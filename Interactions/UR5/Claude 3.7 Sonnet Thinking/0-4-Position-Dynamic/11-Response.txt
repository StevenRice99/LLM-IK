After carefully examining the feedback and correct joint values, I see that I need to precisely follow the approach from the existing code. Let me provide a corrected solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Calculate joint 1 (base rotation) exactly as in EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Setup for the planar 3R problem following EXISTING 2
    # Link lengths from the robot
    L1 = 0.425      # Joint 2 to Joint 3 z-offset
    L2 = 0.39225    # Joint 3 to Joint 4 z-offset
    L3 = 0.09465    # Joint 5 to TCP z-offset
    y_offset = -0.0267  # Fixed y-offset as stated in EXISTING 2
    
    # Define planar forward kinematics to verify solutions
    def fk_planar(theta1, theta2, theta3):
        x_fk = L1 * math.sin(theta1) + L2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2) + L3 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
        z_fk = L1 * math.cos(theta1) + L2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2) + L3 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
        return (x_fk, y_offset, z_fk)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the z-axis (cylindrical coordinate)
    x_planar = math.hypot(x, y)
    z_planar = z
    
    # Define the end-effector orientation parameter
    psi = math.atan2(x_planar, z_planar)
    T_options = [psi, psi + math.pi]
    
    candidates = []
    for T in T_options:
        # Calculate the wrist center by subtracting L3 in the T direction
        x_w = x_planar - L3 * math.sin(T)
        z_w = z_planar - L3 * math.cos(T)
        
        # Distance to the wrist center
        r_w = math.sqrt(x_w**2 + z_w**2)
        
        # Apply law of cosines to find angle between L1 and L2
        cos_beta = (r_w**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
        
        # Ensure the value is within valid range
        cos_beta = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_beta))
        
        for sign in (1, -1):  # Two possible solutions (elbow up/down)
            beta = sign * math.acos(cos_beta)
            
            # Calculate angle to wrist center
            phi_w = math.atan2(x_w, z_w)
            
            # Calculate the angle between L1 and r_w
            delta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(beta), L1 + L2 * math.cos(beta))
            
            # Calculate joint angles
            theta2_candidate = phi_w - delta
            theta3_candidate = beta
            theta4_candidate = T - (theta2_candidate + theta3_candidate)
            
            # Compute forward kinematics to check accuracy
            x_fk, _, z_fk = fk_planar(theta2_candidate, theta3_candidate, theta4_candidate)
            err = math.hypot(x_fk - x_planar, z_fk - z_planar)
            
            candidates.append((err, theta2_candidate, theta3_candidate, theta4_candidate))
    
    # Choose the solution with the smallest error
    best = min(candidates, key=lambda tup: tup[0])
    theta2, theta3, theta4 = best[1], best[2], best[3]
    
    # Joint 5 doesn't affect position
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    # Normalize angles to range [-π, π]
    def normalize(angle):
        while angle > math.pi:
            angle -= 2 * math.pi
        while angle < -math.pi:
            angle += 2 * math.pi
        return angle
    
    theta1 = normalize(theta1)
    theta2 = normalize(theta2)
    theta3 = normalize(theta3)
    theta4 = normalize(theta4)
    theta5 = normalize(theta5)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates joint 1 (theta1) using exactly the same formula as in EXISTING 1: `theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)`
2. Uses precisely the same constants and approach for the planar subproblem as in EXISTING 2
3. Calculates the cylindrical coordinate (distance from z-axis) for the planar problem
4. Considers both possible end-effector orientations and both elbow configurations
5. Selects the most accurate solution based on forward kinematics error

The key to this solution is following the exact approach demonstrated in the existing code examples without deviating from their mathematical formulation.
