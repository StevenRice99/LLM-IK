Thank you for providing the forward kinematics results. This helps me understand the robot structure when all joints are at zero.

I can now see that:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis (affecting x,y coordinates)
- Joints 2, 3, and 4 rotate around the Y-axis (affecting primarily the x-z plane)
- Joint 5 rotates around the Z-axis but doesn't affect the TCP position

Based on this information, I'll now complete the inverse kinematics solution by combining approaches from the existing code examples:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation about Z)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Transform target position after joint 1 rotation
    # We're essentially rotating the target point about the Z axis by -theta1
    x_new = x * math.cos(-theta1) - y * math.sin(-theta1)
    y_new = x * math.sin(-theta1) + y * math.cos(-theta1)
    
    # Adjust the target point to account for the offset in y introduced by the robot's geometry
    y_offset = 0.10915  # From the TCP y-coordinate when all joints are at zero
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, the problem becomes planar in the new x-z plane
    # We can now use the approach from the second existing code to solve joints 2, 3, and 4
    
    L1 = 0.425      # Z distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    L2 = 0.39225    # Z distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    L3 = 0.09465    # Z distance from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # The y position after joint 1 rotation should match the robot's y offset
    # Otherwise, the target cannot be reached exactly
