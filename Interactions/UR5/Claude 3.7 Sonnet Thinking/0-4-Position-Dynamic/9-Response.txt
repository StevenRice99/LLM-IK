I see the issues with my previous solutions. Let me take a more precise approach by properly incorporating the robot's kinematic structure and following the approach from the successful example code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for joint 1 using the same approach as in EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Prepare for the planar IK problem (joints 2-4)
    # Define the robot's link lengths as described in EXISTING 2
    L1 = 0.425      # Z distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    L2 = 0.39225    # Z distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    L3 = 0.09465    # Z distance from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # The fixed y coordinate in the plane is:
    y_offset = -0.0267  # -0.1197 + 0.093 as described in EXISTING 2
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we transform the target into the X-Z plane
    # We rotate the target by -theta1 around Z axis
    x_rot = x * math.cos(-theta1) - y * math.sin(-theta1)
    y_rot = x * math.sin(-theta1) + y * math.cos(-theta1)
    
    # We use the distance from Z axis as our x-coordinate for the planar problem
    x_planar = math.hypot(x, y)  # Distance from the Z-axis
    z_planar = z
    
    # Step 3: Solve the planar IK problem using the approach from EXISTING 2
    def fk_planar(theta1, theta2, theta3):
        x_fk = L1 * math.sin(theta1) + L2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2) + L3 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
        z_fk = L1 * math.cos(theta1) + L2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2) + L3 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
        return (x_fk, y_offset, z_fk)
    
    # Define the orientation parameter (end-effector angle in X-Z plane)
    psi = math.atan2(x_planar, z_planar)
    T_options = [psi, psi + math.pi]
    
    candidates = []
    for T in T_options:
        # Calculate the wrist center by subtracting L3 in the T direction
        x_w = x_planar - L3 * math.sin(T)
        z_w = z_planar - L3 * math.cos(T)
        
        # Distance to the wrist center
        r_w = math.sqrt(x_w ** 2 + z_w ** 2)
        
        # Law of cosines to find the angle between L1 and L2
        cos_beta = (r_w ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
        cos_beta = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_beta))  # Ensure within valid range
        
        # Calculate beta (angle between L1 and L2)
        for sign in (1, -1):  # Two possible solutions (elbow up/down)
            beta = sign * math.acos(cos_beta)
            
            # Calculate phi_w (angle to wrist center)
            phi_w = math.atan2(x_w, z_w)
            
            # Calculate delta (angle between L1 and r_w)
            delta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(beta), L1 + L2 * math.cos(beta))
            
            # Calculate joint angles
            theta2_candidate = phi_w - delta
            theta3_candidate = beta
            theta4_candidate = T - (theta2_candidate + theta3_candidate)
            
            # Compute forward kinematics to check accuracy
            x_fk, _, z_fk = fk_planar(theta2_candidate, theta3_candidate, theta4_candidate)
            err = math.hypot(x_fk - x_planar, z_fk - z_planar)
            
            candidates.append((err, theta2_candidate, theta3_candidate, theta4_candidate))
    
    # Choose the solution with the smallest error
    best = min(candidates, key=lambda tup: tup[0])
    theta2, theta3, theta4 = (best[1], best[2], best[3])
    
    # Joint 5 doesn't affect position
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    # Normalize angles to range [-π, π]
    def normalize(angle):
        while angle > math.pi:
            angle -= 2 * math.pi
        while angle < -math.pi:
            angle += 2 * math.pi
        return angle
    
    theta1 = normalize(theta1)
    theta2 = normalize(theta2)
    theta3 = normalize(theta3)
    theta4 = normalize(theta4)
    theta5 = normalize(theta5)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

My solution now:
1. Calculates joint 1 angle using the inverse tangent approach from EXISTING 1
2. Uses the exact constants and approach from EXISTING 2 for the planar IK problem
3. Transforms the target position correctly for the planar subproblem
4. Considers both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations
5. Selects the most accurate solution based on forward kinematics error

This solution directly incorporates the successful approaches demonstrated in the provided code examples, following the same mathematical principles that have proven effective.
