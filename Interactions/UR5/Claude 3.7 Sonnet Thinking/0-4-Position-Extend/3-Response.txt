Based on the forward kinematics results, I can see the robot's configuration when all joints are at 0. This will help me understand the kinematic structure as I develop the inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the robot description and results, I can see that:
- The TCP position when all joints are 0 is [0, 0.10915, 0.9119]
- The TCP is offset from joint 5 by [0, 0, 0.09465]
- Joint 5 rotates around the Z-axis, so it affects orientation but not position when the TCP is offset only in Z

To complete the inverse kinematics function, I'll need to extend the existing solution for the first 4 joints and add joint 5. Since joint 5 is a wrist rotation around the Z-axis and the TCP is offset only in the Z direction from joint 5, joint 5 doesn't affect the TCP position.

Here's my solution:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    x, y, z = p
    target_x, target_y, target_z = x, y, z - 0.09465
    
    # Calculate values for joints 1-4 using the existing solution
    numerator = target_x ** 2 + target_y ** 2 + target_z ** 2 - 0.346395
    denominator = 0.3341625
    cos_q3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)
    q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)
    A = 0.425 + 0.39225 * np.cos(q3)
    B = 0.39225 * np.sin(q3)
    S_squared = target_x ** 2 + target_y ** 2 - 0.10915 ** 2
    S = np.sqrt(S_squared) if S_squared >= 0 else 0.0
    C = target_z
    numerator_q2 = S * A - C * B
    denominator_q2 = S * B + C * A
    q2 = np.arctan2(numerator_q2, denominator_q2)
    phi = np.arctan2(0.10915, S) if S != 0 else np.pi / 2
    q1 = np.arctan2(target_y, target_x) - phi
    q1 = (q1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi
    q4 = 0.0
    
    # For position control, joint 5 can be set to any value
    # Setting it to 0 for simplicity
    q5 = 0.0
    
    return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
```

The approach here is:
1. Adjust the target position by subtracting the TCP offset in the Z direction
2. Use the existing solution to calculate joints 1-4 to position joint 5 correctly
3. Set joint 5 to 0 (it can be any value since it doesn't affect position)

This solution maintains the same approach as the existing code while extending it to account for the 5th joint and the TCP offset.
