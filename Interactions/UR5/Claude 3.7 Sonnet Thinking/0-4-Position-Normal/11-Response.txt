Based on the feedback and additional forward kinematics test, I need to revise my inverse kinematics solution completely. Let me develop a more accurate approach that properly accounts for all the robot's link transformations.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    d1 = 0.13585  # Offset from Joint 1 to Joint 2 in Z (y-direction in robot frame)
    a2 = 0.425    # Distance from Joint 2 to Joint 3 in X (z-direction in robot frame)
    d2 = -0.1197  # Offset from Joint 2 to Joint 3 in Z (y-direction in robot frame)
    a3 = 0.39225  # Distance from Joint 3 to Joint 4 in X (z-direction in robot frame)
    d4 = 0.093    # Distance from Joint 4 to Joint 5 in Z (y-direction in robot frame)
    d6 = 0.09465  # Distance from Joint 5 to TCP in X (z-direction in robot frame)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Since we're dealing with position-only IK, we'll back-calculate the wrist position
    # The wrist position is affected by the TCP offset and joint 5 position
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position by moving back from TCP along the arm direction
    # For a 5-DOF robot with final joint rotating around Z, this requires some care
    # We need to consider the effect of joint 5 and the TCP offset
    
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # radius in xy-plane
    
    # First, we'll try to solve for the wrist center (WC)
    # Since joint 5 rotates around Z-axis, and we have a z-offset to TCP,
    # the WC is offset from TCP by the distance d6 in the direction determined by joints 2,3,4
    
    # For position-only IK, we can use a geometric approach
    # We know the final TCP position, and need to find joint angles
    
    # Simplified approach - we'll solve for a 3-joint planar robot in the plane defined by theta1
    # Then we'll distribute the angles appropriately
    
    # First, find a reference point that is d6 below the target (this is approximate WC location)
    wx = x - d6 * (x / r)  # Approximate wrist x-coordinate
    wy = y - d6 * (y / r)  # Approximate wrist y-coordinate
    wz = z                 # Approximate wrist z-coordinate
    
    # Transform to the plane containing joints 2,3,4
    w_r = np.sqrt(wx**2 + wy**2)  # wrist center radius in xy-plane
    
    # Now we can solve the triangle formed by the arm segments
    # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    joint2_to_wc_xy = w_r
    joint2_to_wc_z = wz - d1
    joint2_to_wc = np.sqrt(joint2_to_wc_xy**2 + joint2_to_wc_z**2)
    
    # Compute arm segments effective lengths (accounting for offsets)
    l1 = np.sqrt(a2**2 + d2**2)  # Effective length of segment between joints 2 and 3
    l2 = np.sqrt(a3**2 + d4**2)  # Effective length of segment between joints 3 and 5
    
    # Compute joint angles using law of cosines
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if joint2_to_wc > l1 + l2 or joint2_to_wc < abs(l1 - l2):
        # If target is unreachable, return a default or best approximation
        # However, instructions say all targets will be reachable
        pass
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle between first and second arm segments)
    cos_theta3 = (joint2_to_wc**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1, 1)
    theta3_internal = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Adjust theta3 based on joint convention and link offsets
    # For the structure given, we need to invert the angle and adjust for offsets
    theta3 = -(np.pi - theta3_internal)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and arctangent
    # First, find the angle between the horizontal and the line to the wrist center
    gamma = np.arctan2(joint2_to_wc_z, joint2_to_wc_xy)
    
    # Then find the angle between this line and the first arm segment using law of sines
    sin_alpha = l2 * np.sin(theta3_internal) / joint2_to_wc
    alpha = np.arcsin(sin_alpha)
    
    # Compute theta2
    theta2 = gamma - alpha
    
    # Calculate theta4 to point the end effector appropriately
    # For position-only IK, we can set this to keep the end effector aligned
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    # Set theta5 (doesn't affect position)
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution attempts to:
1. Calculate joint 1 (base rotation) based on the target position
2. Approximate the wrist center by moving back from the target along the arm direction
3. Transform the problem to a 2D plane and solve using the law of cosines for joint 3
4. Calculate joint 2 using the law of sines and arctangent
5. Set joint 4 to maintain end-effector alignment and joint 5 to 0 (as it doesn't affect position)

The key improvements from my previous approach include better handling of link offsets and a more careful calculation of the wrist center position.
