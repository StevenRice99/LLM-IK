I'll create a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of this 5-DOF manipulator. Looking at the details and the FORWARD_KINEMATICS test results, I can better understand the robot's structure and how the joints affect the end-effector position.

First, I need to understand how each joint contributes to the TCP position:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis, determining the orientation in the XY plane
- Joints 2, 3, and 4 rotate around Y-axis, controlling the arm's extension and height
- Joint 5 rotates around Z-axis at the end of the arm

Here's my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from Joint 1 to Joint 2 in Y
    l2z = 0.425   # Distance from Joint 2 to Joint 3 in Z
    l2y = -0.1197 # Offset from Joint 2 to Joint 3 in Y
    l3 = 0.39225  # Distance from Joint 3 to Joint 4 in Z
    l4y = 0.093   # Offset from Joint 4 to Joint 5 in Y
    l5z = 0.09465 # Distance from Joint 5 to TCP in Z
    
    # Step 1: Calculate theta1 (base rotation)
    if x == 0 and y == 0:
        theta1 = 0  # If directly above the base, theta1 can be any value
    else:
        theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the wrist center position (location of joint 5)
    # The TCP is offset from the wrist center by l5z in the Z direction
    wc_x = x
    wc_y = y
    wc_z = z - l5z
    
    # Convert to polar coordinates in the plane defined by theta1
    r = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2)  # Radial distance in XY plane
    
    # Step 3: Use geometric approach to solve for theta2 and theta3
    # We can simplify to a 2D problem in the plane defined by theta1
    
    # Calculate distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    dx = r
    dz = wc_z - l1
    D = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2)
    
    # Calculate lengths of arm segments in the plane
    a2 = np.sqrt(l2z**2 + l2y**2)  # Effective length of segment 2
    a3 = np.sqrt(l3**2 + l4y**2)   # Effective length of segment 3
    
    # Use law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # First find the angle from vertical to the line connecting joint 2 to the wrist center
    gamma = np.arctan2(dx, dz)
    # Then find the angle between this line and the first arm segment
    beta = np.arctan2(a3 * np.sin(theta3), a2 + a3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = gamma - beta
    
    # Step 4: Calculate theta4 to align the end effector appropriately
    # For position-only IK, we can set theta4 to align the end effector
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)  # This keeps the end effector parallel to the ground
    
    # Step 5: Set theta5
    # For position-only IK, we can set theta5 to any value
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution breaks down the inverse kinematics problem into steps:
1. Calculate theta1 based on the XY position of the target
2. Find the wrist center position by accounting for the TCP offset
3. Convert the problem to a 2D planar manipulator problem in the plane defined by theta1
4. Use the law of cosines to calculate theta3
5. Use geometry to calculate theta2
6. Calculate theta4 to maintain a specific end-effector orientation
7. Set theta5 to a default value since we're only concerned with position

The solution accounts for the offsets in the robot's structure and provides a closed-form analytical solution for reaching any reachable point in the robot's workspace.
