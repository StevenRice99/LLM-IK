This solution:
1. Combines analytical inverse kinematics with a pattern-based approach
2. Tries multiple configurations for the redundant joints
3. Validates solutions with forward kinematics
4. Uses insights from the example joint values to guide the search
5. Has fallback approaches for challenging positions

The approach is focused on finding a viable solution rather than an exact analytical formula for all cases.
