                    tcp_pos = T[:3, 3]
                    
                    # Calculate error
                    error = math.sqrt((tcp_pos[0] - x)**2 + (tcp_pos[1] - y)**2 + (tcp_pos[2] - z)**2)
                    
                    # Update best solution if better
                    if error < min_error:
                        min_error = error
                        best_solution = (theta1_init, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
    
    # If no solution found, return a default
    if best_solution is None:
        return (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    
    return best_solution
```

But I'm concerned that this brute-force approach might be too slow. Let me analyze the failed test cases more carefully to develop a more precise analytical solution.
