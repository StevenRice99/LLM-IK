```

This solution follows these key steps:
1. Uses analytical approaches to calculate joint angles
2. Tries multiple configurations to handle the redundant degrees of freedom
3. Validates solutions with forward kinematics
4. Includes special cases and fallbacks for challenging positions
5. Normalizes the angles to the standard range

The solution handles the complex robot geometry with multiple Y-axis rotations and the Z-axis rotations that affect the final position.
