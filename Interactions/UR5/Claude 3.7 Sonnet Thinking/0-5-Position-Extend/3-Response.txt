Based on the forward kinematics test, I can see the robot's default position and structure. Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution.

I need to extend the existing 5-DOF solution to handle the full 6-DOF robot including the TCP offset. Looking at the robot structure, I notice that:

1. The existing solution solves for joints 1-5 to position link 6
2. I need to account for the additional TCP offset [0, 0.0823, 0]
3. Since joint 6 rotates around the Y-axis and the TCP offset is along the Y-axis, joint 6 doesn't change the Y-component of the TCP position

Here's my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    
    x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp = p
    
    # Calculate the position of link 6
    # The TCP has a fixed offset of [0, 0.0823, 0] from link 6 in the link 6 frame
    # Since joint 6 rotates around the Y-axis and the offset is along the Y-axis,
    # the offset is not affected by joint 6's value
    x_link6 = x_tcp
    y_link6 = y_tcp - 0.0823
    z_link6 = z_tcp
    
    # Use the existing solution to calculate joint angles 1-5
    # This will position link 6 at (x_link6, y_link6, z_link6)
    d2_y = 0.13585
    y_chain = -0.1197 + 0.093
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = 0.09465
    delta = y_chain + d2_y
    r = math.hypot(x_link6, y_link6)
    phi = math.atan2(-x_link6, y_link6)
    arg = delta / r
    arg = max(-1.0, min(1.0, arg))
    gamma = math.acos(arg)
    t1_cands = [phi + gamma, phi - gamma]
    best = (1000000000.0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    for t1 in t1_cands:
        c1 = math.cos(t1)
        s1 = math.sin(t1)
        x2 = c1 * x_link6 + s1 * y_link6
        y2 = -s1 * x_link6 + c1 * y_link6 - d2_y
        z2 = z_link6
        psi = math.atan2(x2, z2)
        for T in (psi, psi + math.pi):
            xw = x2 - L3 * math.sin(T)
            zw = z2 - L3 * math.cos(T)
            rw2 = xw * xw + zw * zw
            cosb = (rw2 - L1 * L1 - L2 * L2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
            cosb = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cosb))
            for sign in (+1.0, -1.0):
                b = sign * math.acos(cosb)
                phi_w = math.atan2(xw, zw)
                delta_w = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(b), L1 + L2 * math.cos(b))
                t2 = phi_w - delta_w
                t3 = b
                t4 = T - (t2 + t3)
                x_fk = L1 * math.sin(t2) + L2 * math.sin(t2 + t3) + L3 * math.sin(t2 + t3 + t4)
                z_fk = L1 * math.cos(t2) + L2 * math.cos(t2 + t3) + L3 * math.cos(t2 + t3 + t4)
                err2 = (x_fk - x2) ** 2 + (z_fk - z2) ** 2 + (y2 - y_chain) ** 2
                if err2 < best[0]:
                    best = (err2, t1, t2, t3, t4)
    _, θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4 = best
    
    # Set θ5 and θ6 to 0
    # Since we're only concerned with position (not orientation),
    # and joint 6 doesn't affect the TCP's position along the Y-axis,
    # we can set these values to 0
    θ5 = 0.0
    θ6 = 0.0
    
    def norm(a):
        while a > math.pi:
            a -= 2 * math.pi
        while a < -math.pi:
            a += 2 * math.pi
        return a
    
    return (norm(θ1), norm(θ2), norm(θ3), norm(θ4), norm(θ5), norm(θ6))
```

This solution works by:
1. Adjusting the target position to account for the TCP offset from link 6
2. Using the existing algorithm to calculate joint angles 1-4 that position link 5
3. Setting joint 5 to 0 (as in the original solution)
4. Setting joint 6 to 0 since it doesn't affect the TCP position (the TCP offset is along the Y-axis, and joint 6 rotates around the Y-axis)

The solution is simplified for the position-only requirement, and since only a valid configuration is needed, setting joints 5 and 6 to 0 is sufficient.
