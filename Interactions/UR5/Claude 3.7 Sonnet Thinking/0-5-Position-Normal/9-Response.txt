Based on the forward kinematics tests, I now have a better understanding of the robot's structure and behavior. I'll implement the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions
    d1 = 0.13585  # Z offset to joint 2
    a1 = 0        # No X offset
    a2 = 0.425    # Link length from joint 2 to 3
    d3 = -0.1197  # Y offset from joint 2 to 3
    a3 = 0.39225  # Link length from joint 3 to 4
    d5 = 0.093    # Y offset to joint 5
    d6 = 0.09465  # Z offset to joint 6
    dt = 0.0823   # Y offset to TCP
    
    # Account for TCP offset
    # We need to find the wrist center (joint 5) position
    # The TCP is offset by [0, dt, 0] in the local frame
    # We'll work backwards from the target position
    
    # Joint 1 (base joint)
    # The simplest case - rotate around Z to align with target X,Y
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform target to joint 1 frame
    c1 = np.cos(theta1)
    s1 = np.sin(theta1)
    
    # Account for the TCP and final link offsets to find wrist center
    # Wrist center is before the TCP offsets
    wc_x = x - (d5 + dt) * s1
    wc_y = y + (d5 + dt) * c1
    wc_z = z - d6
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center in XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)
    
    # Adjust for joint 2 height
    s = wc_z - d1
    
    # Now solve for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    # Side lengths for the triangle formed by joint 2, joint 3, and wrist center
    side_a = a3
    side_b = np.sqrt(r**2 + (wc_y - d3)**2)
    side_c = a2
    
    # Angle between side_b and side_c (for theta2)
    angle_a = np.arccos((side_b**2 + side_c**2 - side_a**2) / (2 * side_b * side_c))
    
    # Angle between side_a and side_c (for theta3)
    angle_b = np.arccos((side_a**2 + side_c**2 - side_b**2) / (2 * side_a * side_c))
    
    # Angle from horizontal to side_b
    angle_r = np.arctan2(wc_y - d3, r)
    
    # Calculate theta2 and theta3
    theta2 = np.pi/2 - (angle_a + angle_r)  # Adjustment for coordinate frame
    theta3 = np.pi/2 - angle_b              # Adjustment for coordinate frame
    
    # For a position-only solution, we need only first 3 joints
    # Theta4, 5, 6 can be set to maintain the tool orientation
    # For simplicity in this solution, we'll set them to 0
    theta4 = 0
    theta5 = 0
    theta6 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

This solution focuses on solving the inverse kinematics for positioning the end effector at the target position. The first three joints (theta1, theta2, theta3) are calculated to place the wrist center in the correct position, while the last three joints (theta4, theta5, theta6) are set to default values as they primarily control orientation.

Note that this is a position-only solution. For a complete solution that also handles orientation, we would need to solve for theta4, theta5, and theta6 based on the desired orientation of the end effector.
