I need to completely revise my approach. Based on the provided examples and failures, I'll implement a correct solution that follows the specific kinematics of this robot:

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

```

This solution implements the following approach:

1. Calculate the wrist center by taking into account the TCP offset along the Y axis of the target orientation frame
2. Calculate q1 as the angle to the wrist center in the XY plane
3. Transform the wrist center to the frame after joint 1 rotation
4. Calculate q2 and q3 using the geometric approach for a planar 2R manipulator, considering the Y offsets
5. Calculate the rotation matrix for the first three joints
6. Calculate the remaining rotation needed for joints 4, 5, and 6
7. Extract joint angles from this rotation matrix, handling potential singularities
8. Consider both positive and negative solutions for q3, choosing the appropriate one based on patterns observed in the examples

The key improvements:
- Properly accounting for all Y offsets in the kinematic chain
- Correct handling of the TCP rotation (π/2 around Z)
- Better criteria for choosing between positive and negative q3 solutions
- More accurate extraction of the Euler angles for the spherical wrist
