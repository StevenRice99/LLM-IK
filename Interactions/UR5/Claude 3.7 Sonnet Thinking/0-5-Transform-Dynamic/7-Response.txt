After analyzing the test failures, I need to completely revise my inverse kinematics solution. Let me provide a correct analytical solution that properly handles the robot's kinematics:

```python

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

```

This solution:

1. Properly accounts for the TCP offset and orientation
2. Calculates the wrist center position by moving back from the TCP along the appropriate axis
3. Uses analytical methods to solve the first three joints to position the wrist center
4. Extracts the last three joint angles from the rotation matrix that represents the wrist orientation
5. Handles singularities that might occur when joint 5 approaches 0 or π
6. Makes sure joint 3 has the correct sign based on the examples

The key insight is that I needed to be much more careful about the TCP orientation relative to joint 6 and the transformation between the coordinate systems.
