I'll now create a complete solution for the 5-DOF robot's inverse kinematics based on the forward kinematics information I received:

```python

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This solution follows these steps:
1. Calculate the target rotation matrix from the given roll, pitch, yaw
2. Account for the TCP's fixed orientation offset
3. Find the position of the wrist center (joint 5) by moving backward from TCP along the proper axis
4. Calculate theta1 (base rotation)
5. Find the position of joint 3 relative to joint 1
6. Use the law of cosines to calculate theta2
7. Calculate theta3, theta4, and theta5 to achieve the desired orientation
8. Return the joint angles that place the TCP at the desired position and orientation
