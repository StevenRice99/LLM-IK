After analyzing the feedback and the robot's structure in detail, I need to completely rewrite my inverse kinematics solution. The consistent failures with my previous attempts suggest fundamental issues with how I'm interpreting the kinematics chain of this 5-DOF robot.

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
