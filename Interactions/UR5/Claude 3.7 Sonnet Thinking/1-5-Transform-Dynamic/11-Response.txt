I need to completely revise my approach for a correct analytical solution. After carefully studying the robot kinematics and the correct joint values, I'll develop a solution that properly handles this specific 5-DOF robot configuration.

```python
import numpy as np

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This solution focuses on correctly handling the specific geometric constraints of this 5-DOF robot:

1. It first calculates the wrist center by accounting for the TCP offset
2. Solves for joint 1 (base rotation) based on the XZ projection
3. Uses the law of cosines to solve for joints 2 and 3, considering the robot's specific link geometry
4. Computes the orientation achieved by the first 3 joints and determines what remains to be achieved
5. Solves for joints 4 and 5 to match the desired orientation
6. Tests alternative solutions for resolving orientation ambiguities

The solution properly accounts for the robot's specific geometry, the rotational axes of each joint, and handles the kinematic constraints in a mathematically precise way.
