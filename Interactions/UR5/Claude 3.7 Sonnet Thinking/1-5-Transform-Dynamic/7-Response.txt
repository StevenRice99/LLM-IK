I see the issue with my previous solution. After analyzing the FORWARD_KINEMATICS output for the correct joint angles, I need to completely revise my approach to properly handle the 5-DOF kinematics chain. Here's my revised solution:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This solution:

1. Computes inverse kinematics by working through the kinematic chain from base to tip
2. Calculates joint angles that satisfy both position and orientation constraints
3. Handles the 5-DOF constraint by finding the solution with minimum orientation error
4. Properly accounts for the robot's specific joint configuration and link lengths
5. Uses sampling to find the best starting joint angle for joint 1

The approach first computes the position of joint 5 by removing the tool offset from the TCP position. Then it samples different values for joint 1 and tries to solve the remaining kinematic chain for each sample. For each configuration, it calculates the orientation error and selects the solution with minimum error.
