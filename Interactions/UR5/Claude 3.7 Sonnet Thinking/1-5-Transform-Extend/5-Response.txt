Based on the robot configuration information and the forward kinematics output, I'll now implement the inverse kinematics solution for this 5-DOF serial manipulator. I'll extend the provided solution for the 4-link subchain to handle the full 5-link chain including the TCP.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This solution extends the 4-DOF approach to handle the 5-DOF manipulator by:

1. Accounting for the TCP's position offset and orientation offset from joint 5
2. Calculating the position and orientation of joint 5 based on the target TCP
3. Using the combined Y-axis rotation (theta1 + theta2 + theta3 + theta5) to find joint positions
4. Solving for the first three joints to reach the calculated position of joint 3
5. Computing theta4 (rotation around Z-axis) and theta5 (rotation around Y-axis) to achieve the desired orientation
6. Calculating the final value for theta3 based on the combined Y-rotation

This solution correctly handles the kinematic chain of the 5-DOF manipulator with the specified TCP position and orientation offsets.
