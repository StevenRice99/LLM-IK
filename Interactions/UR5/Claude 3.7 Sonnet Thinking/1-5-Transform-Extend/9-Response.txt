After reviewing the feedback, I see that my solution still has significant issues. Let me develop a completely new approach that correctly models the manipulator's kinematic structure.

    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This revised approach:

1. Correctly accounts for the robot's kinematic chain and all link offsets
2. Uses a geometric approach to solve for joint angles, particularly for the first three joints
3. Addresses potential singularities when the wrist is directly above the base
4. Computes the necessary rotations to determine joint 4 and joint 5 angles
5. Properly handles the TCP's position and orientation offset

The approach uses forward kinematics principles to analytically solve the inverse kinematics problem, working through the kinematic chain systematically.
