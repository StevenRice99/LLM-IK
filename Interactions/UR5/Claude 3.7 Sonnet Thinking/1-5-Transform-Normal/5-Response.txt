I'll develop an inverse kinematics solution for this 5-DOF robot. Based on the provided details and forward kinematics tests, I can see this is a robot with:
- 4 joints rotating around the Y-axis (1, 2, 3, 5)
- 1 joint rotating around the Z-axis (4)
- TCP with an offset and orientation relative to the last joint

Let me implement the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    # Convert orientation Euler angles to rotation matrix
    R_x = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, cos(rx), -sin(rx)],
        [0, sin(rx), cos(rx)]

    R_y = np.array([
        [cos(ry), 0, sin(ry)],

    c1, s1 = cos(theta1), sin(theta1)
    x_prime = c1 * wc[0] + s1 * wc[2]
    y_prime = wc[1]
    z_prime = -s1 * wc[0] + c1 * wc[2]
    
    # Position of wrist center relative to joint 2
    dx = x_prime
    dy = y_prime - d2
    dz = z_prime - a2
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    L = sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)

    alpha = acos(cos_alpha)
    
    phi = atan2(sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2), dz)
    theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    cos_beta = (L2**2 + L3**2 - L**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)

    R1_2 = np.array([

    # Rotation from base to joint 3
    R0_3 = R0_1 @ R1_2 @ R2_3
    
    # Compute desired rotation from joint 3 to TCP
    R3_6 = R0_3.T @ R
    
    # Extract θ4 and θ5 from the rotation matrix
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z-axis, joint 5 around Y-axis
    theta4 = atan2(R3_6[1, 0], R3_6[0, 0])
    theta5 = atan2(-R3_6[2, 1], R3_6[2, 2])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution works by:
1. Converting the target orientation to a rotation matrix
2. Finding the wrist center position by subtracting the TCP offset
3. Computing θ1 based on the wrist center position in the XZ plane
4. Using the law of cosines to compute θ2 and θ3 for positioning the wrist center
5. Computing θ4 and θ5 to achieve the desired end-effector orientation

The solution considers the robot's kinematic structure with the Y-axis and Z-axis rotations and properly accounts for all the link offsets.
