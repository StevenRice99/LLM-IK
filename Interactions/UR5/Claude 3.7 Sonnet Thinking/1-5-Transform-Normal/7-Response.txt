Based on the feedback, my inverse kinematics solution has significant issues. Let me develop a more accurate solution that correctly handles this 5-DOF robot's kinematics.

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This solution addresses several key issues from my previous attempt:

1. Correctly accounts for the TCP's orientation offset ([0, 0, 1.570796325])
2. More carefully handles the geometry when calculating the wrist center position
3. Correctly models the offsets between joints in both Y and Z directions
4. Better handles the law of cosines calculations with numerical stability checks
5. Properly extracts joint angles 4 and 5 based on the remaining rotation after joints 1-3
6. Normalizes angles to maintain consistency

The approach decomposes the problem into position (joints 1-3) and orientation (joints 4-5) components, using the geometric relationships between links and the properties of rotation matrices.
