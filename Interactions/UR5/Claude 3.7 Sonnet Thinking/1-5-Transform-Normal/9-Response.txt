Based on the feedback, I need to completely revise my approach. Let me develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution that properly accounts for the robot's structure and joint configurations.

```python

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

```

This solution addresses several key issues in my previous approaches:

1. More carefully handles the geometric relationships between joints, especially for theta2 and theta3
2. Properly accounts for the robot's specific link offsets in both Y and Z directions
3. Correctly transforms the TCP offset to the world frame before calculating the wrist center
4. Uses the proper rotation sequence for joint 4 (Z-axis) and joint 5 (Y-axis)
5. Handles gimbal lock cases for joint 4
6. Uses the law of cosines with appropriate numerical stability checks

The solution decomposes the problem into the positioning part (joints 1-3) and the orientation part (joints 4-5), working with the correct rotation matrices and geometric relationships for this specific robot configuration.
