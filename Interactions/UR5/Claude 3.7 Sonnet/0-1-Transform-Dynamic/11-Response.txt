I see the issue now. My previous solution was too simplistic. Looking at the feedback examples more carefully, I can see that there's a complex relationship between the orientation parameters and the joint angles. Let me analyze the examples systematically:

Example 1:
- Orientation: [3.14, 0.038, 0.147]
- Correct joints: [-2.994, -3.180]

Example 2:
- Orientation: [3.14, 0.006, 1.964]
- Correct joints: [-1.178, 3.136]

Example 3:
- Orientation: [3.14, -0.118, 0.276]
- Correct joints: [-2.866, 3.260]

Example 4:
- Orientation: [3.14, -0.336, 2.510]
- Correct joints: [-0.632, -2.806]

Example 5:
- Orientation: [0, -0.156, 0.821]
- Correct joints: [0.821, -0.156]

Example 6:
- Orientation: [0, 0.787, 0.422]
- Correct joints: [0.422, 0.787]

I notice a pattern:
1. When rx is close to 0, joint1 = rz and joint2 = ry
2. When rx is close to π, the relationship is more complex

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Case 1: When rx is close to 0
    if abs(rx) < 0.1:
        joint1 = rz
        joint2 = ry
    # Case 2: When rx is close to π or -π
    elif abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 0.1:
        # Looking at examples with rx ≈ π:
        # For example 5: rx=0, rz=0.821, joint1=0.821
        # For example 6: rx=0, rz=0.422, joint1=0.422
        # For example 1: rx=π, rz=0.147, joint1=-2.994 (≈ -π + rz)
        # For example 2: rx=π, rz=1.964, joint1=-1.178 (≈ -π + rz)
        # For example 3: rx=π, rz=0.276, joint1=-2.866 (≈ -π + rz)
        # For example 4: rx=π, rz=2.510, joint1=-0.632 (≈ -π + rz)
        
        # It seems when rx ≈ π, joint1 = -π + rz or joint1 = π + rz
        if rz > 0:
            joint1 = rz - math.pi
        else:
            joint1 = rz + math.pi
        
        # For joint2, the relationship with ry is also complex:
        # For example 1: ry=0.038, joint2=-3.180 (≈ -π - ry)
        # For example 2: ry=0.006, joint2=3.136 (≈ π - ry)
        # For example 3: ry=-0.118, joint2=3.260 (≈ π - ry)
        # For example 4: ry=-0.336, joint2=-2.806 (≈ -π - ry)
        
        # It seems joint2 depends on the quadrant of joint1 and the sign of ry
        if joint1 > 0:
            if ry > 0:
                joint2 = math.pi - ry
            else:
                joint2 = math.pi - ry
        else:
            if ry > 0:
                joint2 = -math.pi - ry
            else:
                joint2 = math.pi - ry
    else:
        # For other orientations, we need a more complex calculation
        # Based on examples 7-10, there seems to be a pattern where:
        # When rx is not close to 0 or π, joint1 and joint2 have specific relationships
        
        # For example 7: rx=3.14, rz=1.966, joint1=-1.176 (≈ -π + rz)
        # For example 8: rx=0, rz=0.407, joint1=0.407
        # For example 9: rx=0, rz=-1.918, joint1=-1.918
        # For example 10: rx=-3.14, rz=-2.867, joint1=0.274 (≈ π + rz)
        
        if abs(rx) < math.pi/2:
            joint1 = rz
            joint2 = ry
        else:
            if rz > 0:
                joint1 = rz - math.pi
            else:
                joint1 = rz + math.pi
                
            if joint1 > 0:
                joint2 = math.pi - ry
            else:
                joint2 = -math.pi - ry
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After further analysis, I see that the relationship is even more direct than I initially thought. Let me provide a more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Based on the examples, I can see that:
    # When rx is close to 0:
    #   joint1 = rz
    #   joint2 = ry
    # When rx is close to π:
    #   joint1 = rz ± π (depending on the quadrant)
    #   joint2 = π - ry or -π - ry (depending on the quadrant)
    
    if abs(rx) < 0.1:  # rx close to 0
        joint1 = rz
        joint2 = ry
    elif abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 0.1:  # rx close to π or -π
        # Adjust joint1 based on rz
        if -math.pi/2 < rz < math.pi/2:
            joint1 = rz + math.pi
        else:
            joint1 = rz - math.pi
        
        # Adjust joint2 based on ry and the quadrant of joint1
        if joint1 > 0:
            joint2 = math.pi - ry
        else:
            joint2 = -math.pi - ry
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to refine this further. Let me analyze the examples one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # When rx is close to 0, the relationship is direct
    if abs(rx) < 0.1:
        joint1 = rz
        joint2 = ry
    # When rx is close to π or -π, we need to adjust
    elif abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 0.1:
        # For joint1, we need to flip rz
        joint1 = -rz
        
        # For joint2, we need to adjust based on the sign of ry
        if ry > 0:
            joint2 = math.pi - ry
        else:
            joint2 = -math.pi - ry
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
