I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics test results.

Let me analyze the robot structure:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
- The TCP is offset from joint 2 by [0, -0.1197, 0.425]

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how the joints affect the final TCP position. Let me develop the complete inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the plane in which the arm operates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the position of joint 2 in the plane
    
    # Distance from origin to target point in XY plane
    r_xy = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Account for the offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    joint2_offset = 0.13585
    
    # Account for the TCP offset from joint 2
    tcp_offset_y = -0.1197
    tcp_offset_z = 0.425
    
    # Calculate the position relative to joint 2
    # We need to consider the rotation of joint 1
    # The target position in the rotated frame
    x_rel = r_xy - joint2_offset * math.sin(theta1)
    z_rel = z
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2
    # We use the arctangent of the relative position
    # Note: We need to adjust the sign based on the robot's configuration
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_rel, z_rel)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me think more carefully about the geometry.

The forward kinematics tests show that:
1. At (0,0), the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.425]
2. At (1.57, 1.57), the TCP is at [-0.01581, 0.42501, 0.00034]

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # For joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the position in the plane defined by joint 1
    
    # Distance from origin to target in XY plane
    r_xy = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2
    # We need to consider the offset of the TCP from joint 2
    # The TCP is offset by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] in the local frame
    
    # When joint 2 is at 0, the TCP is at [0, joint2_y_offset + tcp_y_offset, tcp_z_offset]
    # We need to find the angle that rotates this point to the target
    
    # First, transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    x_in_plane = r_xy
    z_in_plane = z
    
    # Calculate the angle needed for joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_in_plane, z_in_plane)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I'm still not fully satisfied with this solution. Let me test one more approach:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
    # Using the existing solution for joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
    # Using a modified version of the existing solution for joint 2
    
    # First, transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_local = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_local = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_local = z
    
    # Now solve for joint 2 using the transformed target
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_local, z_local)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After careful consideration of the robot's geometry and the forward kinematics tests, here's my final solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_local = c1 * x + s1 * y
    z_local = z
    
    # Solve for joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_local, z_local)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
