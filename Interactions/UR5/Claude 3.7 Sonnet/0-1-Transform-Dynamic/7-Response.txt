I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics tests.

Let me analyze what I've learned from the forward kinematics tests:

1. When both joints are at 0 (FORWARD_KINEMATICS 0 0):
   - TCP position: [0, 0.01615, 0.425]

2. When joint1 = 1.57 and joint2 = 0 (FORWARD_KINEMATICS 1.57 0):
   - TCP position: [-0.01615, 0.000013, 0.425]
   - This shows that joint1 rotates around the Z-axis

3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (FORWARD_KINEMATICS 0 1.57):
   - TCP position: [0.425, 0.01615, 0.00034]
   - This shows that joint2 rotates around the Y-axis

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Using the existing solution 1 as reference
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # Using the existing solution 2 as reference, but adapted for our specific robot
    # We need to account for the robot's geometry
    
    # First, transform the target point to the frame of joint2
    # Rotate back by -joint1 around Z
    x_j2 = x * math.cos(-joint1) - y * math.sin(-joint1)
    y_j2 = x * math.sin(-joint1) + y * math.cos(-joint1)
    z_j2 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint2 from joint1
    y_j2 -= 0.13585
    
    # Now calculate joint2 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint2
    # When joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0, y_j2, z_j2] = [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # When joint2 rotates, the TCP moves in the X-Z plane
    
    # Calculate the angle in the X-Z plane
    joint2 = math.atan2(x_j2, z_j2)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me think more carefully about the geometry:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame of joint1
    # Rotate back by -joint1 around Z
    x_j1 = x * math.cos(-joint1) - y * math.sin(-joint1)
    y_j1 = x * math.sin(-joint1) + y * math.cos(-joint1)
    z_j1 = z
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The distance from joint2 to TCP in the XZ plane when joint2 = 0 is 0.425
    # The Y offset from joint2 to TCP is -0.1197
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point in the XZ plane relative to joint2
    x_proj = x_j1
    z_proj = z_j1 - 0.13585  # Adjust for the height of joint2
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    joint2 = math.atan2(x_proj, z_proj)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me correct my understanding of the robot's geometry:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # From the forward kinematics tests, we can see:
    # - Joint1 rotates around the Z-axis
    # - Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint1 rotation
    x_j1 = x * math.cos(-joint1) - y * math.sin(-joint1)
    y_j1 = x * math.sin(-joint1) + y * math.cos(-joint1)
    z_j1 = z
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.425] relative to the base
    # The TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint2
    # Joint2 is at [0, 0.13585, 0] relative to joint1
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point in the XZ plane relative to joint2
    # Adjust for the offset of joint2 from joint1
    y_j1 -= 0.13585
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane
    joint2 = math.atan2(x_j1, z_j1)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Let me make one final correction to ensure the solution is accurate:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint1 rotation
    x_j1 = x * math.cos(-joint1) - y * math.sin(-joint1)
    y_j1 = x * math.sin(-joint1) + y * math.cos(-joint1)
    z_j1 = z
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # Based on the forward kinematics tests, joint2 rotates the TCP in the XZ plane
    # When joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.425]
    # When joint2 = 1.57, the TCP is at [0.425, 0.01615, 0.00034]
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane
    joint2 = math.atan2(x_j1, z_j1)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
