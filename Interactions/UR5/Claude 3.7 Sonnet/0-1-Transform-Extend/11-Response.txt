Based on the forward kinematics tests and the feedback, I now have a better understanding of the robot's structure and behavior. Let me develop a correct inverse kinematics solution.

The key insights:
1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
3. The TCP has an offset from joint 2 of [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
4. The orientation parameters are important and need to be considered

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    tcp_offset_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of TCP from joint 2
    tcp_offset_z = 0.425    # Z offset of TCP from joint 2
    
    # First, we need to determine joint 2 angle (around Y-axis)
    # This affects the orientation of the end effector
    theta2 = ry
    
    # Now we need to find joint 1 angle (around Z-axis)
    # This is determined by the target position and orientation
    
    # The rotation matrix for joint 1 (around Z-axis)
    # We can extract this from the target orientation
    theta1 = rz
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, this approach isn't correct. Let me reconsider the problem.

Looking at the feedback examples, I see that the orientation parameters (r) don't directly map to joint angles. I need to solve for the joint angles that will position the TCP at the target position.

Let me revise my approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    tcp_offset_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of TCP from joint 2
    tcp_offset_z = 0.425    # Z offset of TCP from joint 2
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 by working backwards from the TCP position
    # First, create rotation matrices for the target orientation
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, np.cos(rx), -np.sin(rx)],
        [0, np.sin(rx), np.cos(rx)]
    ])
    
    Ry = np.array([
        [np.cos(ry), 0, np.sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-np.sin(ry), 0, np.cos(ry)]
    ])
    
    Rz = np.array([
        [np.cos(rz), -np.sin(rz), 0],
        [np.sin(rz), np.cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Combined rotation matrix
    R = Rz @ Ry @ Rx
    
    # TCP offset in the local frame
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, tcp_offset_y, tcp_offset_z])
    
    # Transform the TCP offset to the global frame
    tcp_offset_global = R @ tcp_offset
    
    # Calculate joint 2 position by subtracting the TCP offset from the target position
    j2_pos = np.array([x, y, z]) - tcp_offset_global
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(j2_pos[0], j2_pos[1])
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to joint 2 in XY plane
    r_xy = math.sqrt(j2_pos[0]**2 + j2_pos[1]**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (around Y-axis)
    # We need to account for the offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    theta2 = math.atan2(j2_pos[2], r_xy - l1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This still doesn't look right. Let me analyze the problem more carefully.

Based on the feedback examples, I need to solve for joint angles that will position the TCP at the target position with the target orientation. Let me revise my approach one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, the orientation is directly determined by the joint angles
    # Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis, which corresponds to rz
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis, which corresponds to ry
    
    # Therefore, the joint angles are:
    theta1 = rz
    theta2 = ry
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
