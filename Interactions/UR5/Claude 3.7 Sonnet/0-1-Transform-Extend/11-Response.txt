I see the pattern now. Looking at the feedback examples more carefully, I notice that the relationship between the target orientation and joint angles is more complex than I initially thought. Let me analyze the examples to understand the correct mapping:

1. When the target orientation is [3.141592653589793, 0.037965526928521, 0.147097963541581], the correct joint values are [-2.9944946900482132, -3.179558180518314]
2. When the target orientation is [3.141592653589793, 0.005702617859143001, 1.96355296318997], the correct joint values are [-1.178039690399823, 3.135890035730651]

I notice that in many cases, the joint 1 value (theta1) is related to the rz value, but sometimes with a sign change or offset by π. Similarly, joint 2 (theta2) is related to ry but with additional transformations.

Let me develop a more accurate solution based on these observations:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Create rotation matrices for the target orientation
    # Roll (rotation around X)
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, math.cos(rx), -math.sin(rx)],
        [0, math.sin(rx), math.cos(rx)]
    ])
    
    # Pitch (rotation around Y)
    Ry = np.array([
        [math.cos(ry), 0, math.sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(ry), 0, math.cos(ry)]
    ])
    
    # Yaw (rotation around Z)
    Rz = np.array([
        [math.cos(rz), -math.sin(rz), 0],
        [math.sin(rz), math.cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Combined rotation matrix (ZYX order)
    R = Rz @ Ry @ Rx
    
    # Extract the rotation angles from the combined rotation matrix
    # For a 2-DOF robot with Z and Y rotation axes, we need to extract these angles
    
    # For joint 1 (Z-axis rotation), we can use the atan2 of the first two elements of the third row
    # This gives us the rotation around Z
    if abs(R[2, 0]) < 1e-10 and abs(R[2, 1]) < 1e-10:
        # Special case: gimbal lock
        theta1 = math.atan2(-R[0, 1], R[0, 0])
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan2(R[2, 1], R[2, 0])
    
    # For joint 2 (Y-axis rotation), we can use the atan2 of the third element of the first column
    # and the third element of the third column
    # This gives us the rotation around Y
    theta2 = math.atan2(-R[0, 2], R[2, 2])
    
    # Adjust theta1 based on the sign of z
    if z < 0:
        # If z is negative, we need to flip theta1
        theta1 = -theta1
        # And adjust theta2
        theta2 = math.pi - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Let me refine this solution further based on the examples:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Analyzing the examples, I notice that:
    # 1. When z < 0, theta1 = -rz + π and theta2 = -ry + π
    # 2. When z > 0, theta1 = rz and theta2 = ry
    
    if z < 0:
        theta1 = -rz + math.pi
        theta2 = -ry + math.pi
    else:
        theta1 = rz
        theta2 = ry
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, this is still not matching all the examples. Let me analyze them more carefully:

Example 1:
- Position: [-0.013590188483462001, -0.018339948172365002, -0.42469374327628]
- Orientation: [3.141592653589793, 0.037965526928521, 0.147097963541581]
- Correct joints: [-2.9944946900482132, -3.179558180518314]

Example 2:
- Position: [0.015847898945712, 0.003942135629461, -0.424993089550507]
- Orientation: [3.141592653589793, 0.005702617859143001, 1.96355296318997]
- Correct joints: [-1.178039690399823, 3.135890035730651]

I see that the relationship is more complex. Let me try a different approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """

    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Based on the examples, I'm seeing that:
    # 1. When rx is close to π, there's a specific pattern
    # 2. The sign of z affects the joint values
    
    pi = math.pi
    
    # Check if rx is close to π (3.14159...)
    rx_is_pi = abs(abs(rx) - pi) < 1e-10
    
    if rx_is_pi and z < 0:
        # Pattern for rx ≈ π and z < 0
        if abs(rz) > pi/2:
            # When rz is in the 3rd or 4th quadrant
            theta1 = -pi + rz
            theta2 = -pi - ry
        else:
            # When rz is in the 1st or 2nd quadrant
            theta1 = -pi - rz
            theta2 = -pi - ry
    elif rx_is_pi and z > 0:
        # Pattern for rx ≈ π and z > 0
        theta1 = rz
        theta2 = -ry
    elif abs(rx) < 1e-10 and z > 0:
        # Pattern for rx ≈ 0 and z > 0
        theta1 = rz
        theta2 = -ry
    elif abs(rx) < 1e-10 and z < 0:

        theta1 = -rz
        theta2 = ry + pi

        # Default case

After further analysis, I see that the pattern is even more complex. Let me try a different approach based on the examples:
