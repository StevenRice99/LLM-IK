I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze the data from the forward kinematics tests to understand the robot's behavior.

From the tests, I can see:
1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.425]
2. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0, the TCP rotates around the Z-axis
3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2), the TCP moves to [0.425, 0.01615, 0.00034]

This confirms that:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
- The robot has a planar structure with the second link extending outward

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the DETAILS section
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_x = 0      # X component of TCP in link 2 frame
    l2_y = -0.1197  # Y component of TCP in link 2 frame
    l2_z = 0.425   # Z component of TCP in link 2 frame
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (around Y-axis)
    # When joint 2 is at 0, the TCP is at [0, l1+l2_y, l2_z]
    # We need to find the angle that rotates the TCP to match the target position
    
    # The projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The projection of l2 onto the XZ plane when rotated
    l2_xz = math.sqrt(l2_x**2 + l2_z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using atan2
    # When joint 2 is 0, l2_z points in the Z direction
    # We need to find the angle to rotate it to match the target
    theta2 = math.atan2(r_xz, y - l1 - l2_y)
    
    # Adjust theta2 to account for the initial orientation of l2
    theta2 = theta2 - math.atan2(l2_z, l2_x)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (around Z-axis)
    # This is simply the angle in the XY plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully.

Looking at the data again:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
- The TCP is offset from joint 2 by [0, -0.1197, 0.425]

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate distance from origin to target in XY plane
    r_xy = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta2 = math.atan2(z, r_xy)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me test one more forward kinematics case to better understand the robot's behavior.
