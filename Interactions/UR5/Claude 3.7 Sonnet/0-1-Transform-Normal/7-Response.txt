I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and movement.

From the test results, I can see:
1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.425]
2. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [-0.01615, 0.000013, 0.425]
3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2), the TCP is at [0.425, 0.01615, 0.00034]

This confirms that:
- Joint1 rotates around the Z-axis (affecting X and Y coordinates)
- Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis (affecting X and Z coordinates)

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the robot description
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint1 to joint2
    l2 = np.sqrt(0.425**2 + 0.1197**2)  # Distance from joint2 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the projection of the TCP position onto the XY plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the TCP offset from the second link
    # The TCP has an offset of 0.01615 in Y direction when both joints are at 0
    # This is the difference between l1 and the Y component of TCP when joints are 0
    y_offset = 0.01615
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # For joint2, we need to consider the projection of the target in the plane defined by joint1
    # Calculate the distance from origin to the projection of the target in XY plane
    # Adjust for the Y offset
    r_adjusted = np.sqrt((r_xy - y_offset*np.sin(joint1))**2 + (z - y_offset*np.cos(joint1))**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle for joint2
    cos_joint2 = (r_adjusted**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle floating-point errors
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The negative sign accounts for the direction of rotation
    joint2 = -np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    
    # Adjust joint2 based on the Z position
    if z < 0:
        joint2 = -joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis after joint1's rotation
3. The TCP has an offset from joint2

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Rotate the target point back by -joint1 to simplify the problem
    x_rot = x * np.cos(-joint1) - y * np.sin(-joint1)
    y_rot = x * np.sin(-joint1) + y * np.cos(-joint1)
    z_rot = z
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the X-Z plane
    # Link dimensions
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint1 to joint2
    l2_x = 0.425  # X component of the distance from joint2 to TCP
    l2_y = -0.1197  # Y component of the distance from joint2 to TCP
    l2 = np.sqrt(l2_x**2 + l2_y**2)  # Total length of second link
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # Using the law of cosines
    d = np.sqrt(x_rot**2 + (z_rot - l1)**2)
    cos_joint2 = (d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * d * l2)
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)  # Handle numerical errors
    
    # Calculate the angle
    joint2 = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    
    # Determine the sign of joint2
    if z_rot < l1:
        joint2 = -joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me complete the final solution:

```python

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position

    # Link dimensions

    # Determine the correct sign for joint2 based on the target z position
    if z < 0:
        joint2 = -joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
