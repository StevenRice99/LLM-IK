I see that my previous approaches still aren't working correctly. Let me take a step back and analyze the problem more carefully.

Looking at the robot configuration:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z axis
- Joint 2 rotates around Y axis
- The TCP has an offset from joint 2 of [0, -0.1197, 0.425]

Let me analyze the examples more systematically to understand the relationship between orientation parameters and joint angles:

Example 1:
- Orientation: [3.141592653589793, 0.037965526928521, 0.147097963541581]
- Correct joint values: [-2.9944946900482132, -3.179558180518314]

Example 2:
- Orientation: [3.141592653589793, 0.005702617859143001, 1.96355296318997]
- Correct joint values: [-1.178039690399823, 3.135890035730651]

Example 3:
- Orientation: [3.141592653589793, -0.118102044950391, 0.275828396690674]
- Correct joint values: [-2.86576425689912, 3.259694698540184]

I notice that when rx is close to π, the relationship between ry and theta2 is not consistent. Sometimes theta2 = ry, sometimes theta2 = -ry.

Let me try a different approach by using the position information to solve for the joint angles:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, determine joint2 (theta2) from the z-coordinate
    # From the robot configuration, we know the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint2
    # and joint2 rotates around Y-axis
    
    # The z-coordinate is determined by: z = 0.425 * cos(theta2)
    # So: theta2 = acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Check if z is within valid range
    if abs(z) > 0.425:
        # Handle edge cases where z is slightly out of range due to numerical precision
        theta2 = 0 if z > 0 else math.pi
    else:
        theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Now, determine joint1 (theta1) from x and y coordinates
    # The position after rotation is:
    # x = 0.425 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) - 0.1197 * sin(theta1)
    # y = 0.425 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1) + 0.1197 * cos(theta1)
    
    # We can solve this system of equations for theta1
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    A = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    B = 0.1197
    
    # Calculate coefficients for the system of equations
    # x = A * cos(theta1) - B * sin(theta1)
    # y = A * sin(theta1) + B * cos(theta1)
    
    # This can be rewritten as:
    # x = C * cos(theta1 + D)
    # y = C * sin(theta1 + D)
    # where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and D = atan2(B, A)
    
    C = math.sqrt(A**2 + B**2)
    D = math.atan2(B, A)
    
    # If C is very small, we have a singularity
    if C < 1e-10:
        # In this case, we can use the orientation to determine theta1
        theta1 = rz
    else:
        # Otherwise, solve for theta1
        theta1_plus_D = math.atan2(y, x)
        theta1 = theta1_plus_D - D
    
    # Now we need to adjust theta1 and theta2 based on the orientation
    # Create rotation matrices for the current solution and the target orientation
    
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([

    # We have four possible configurations:

    # Let's check which one gives a rotation matrix closest to the target
    
    configs = [
        (theta1, theta2),
        (theta1, -theta2),

    for t1, t2 in configs:

    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi

```

Let me try a simpler approach based on the examples:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    # Extract orientation
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this robot, the orientation directly determines the joint angles
    
    # For joint2 (theta2), it's directly related to ry
    theta2 = ry
    
    # For joint1 (theta1), it's directly related to rz
    theta1 = rz
    
    # But we need to make adjustments based on rx
    if abs(rx) < 1e-10:  # rx ≈ 0
        # When rx is close to 0
        theta2 = -ry  # Flip the sign of ry
    elif abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:  # rx ≈ ±π
        # When rx is close to ±π
        if rx > 0:  # rx ≈ π
            # No adjustment needed
            pass
        else:  # rx ≈ -π
            # Flip the sign of ry
            theta2 = -ry
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After analyzing the examples more carefully, I see that the relationship is more complex. Let me try a more comprehensive approach:

    # Extract the y-axis from R_target
    y_axis = R_target[:, 1]
