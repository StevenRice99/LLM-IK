I see that my solution is getting closer, but there's still an issue with the orientation handling. Looking at the test cases, I notice that the orientation component rx (roll) is consistently either π or -π when z is negative. This suggests that we need to handle the orientation sign correctly.

Let me refine my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, when z is negative, we need to handle orientation differently
    if z < 0:
        # If z is negative, we need to adjust the joint angles
        
        # For theta2, we use π - ry or -π - ry depending on the sign of ry
        if ry > 0:
            theta2 = math.pi - ry
        else:
            theta2 = -math.pi - ry
        
        # For theta1, we need to adjust based on rz and rx
        if rx > 0:  # If rx is positive (close to π)
            # We need to adjust theta1 based on rz
            if rz > 0:
                theta1 = -math.pi + rz
            else:
                theta1 = math.pi + rz
        else:  # If rx is negative (close to -π)
            # We need to adjust theta1 based on rz
            if rz > 0:
                theta1 = math.pi - rz
            else:
                theta1 = -math.pi - rz
    else:
        # If z is positive, we directly use ry and rz
        theta2 = ry
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After analyzing the test cases more carefully, I see that I need to handle the relationship between the joint angles and orientation in a more precise way. Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, when z is negative, we need to handle orientation differently
    if z < 0:
        # If z is negative, we need to adjust the joint angles
        
        # For theta2, we use π - ry
        theta2 = math.pi - ry
        
        # For theta1, we need to adjust based on rz
        # Looking at the test cases, when z is negative:
        # If rz is positive, theta1 is negative
        # If rz is negative, theta1 is positive
        if abs(rx) > 3.0:  # If rx is close to ±π
            if rz > 0:
                theta1 = -math.pi + rz
            else:
                theta1 = math.pi + rz
        else:
            theta1 = rz
    else:
        # If z is positive, we directly use ry and rz
        theta2 = ry
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After further analysis of the test cases, I see that I need to handle the relationship between position and orientation more carefully. Let me provide a final solution:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    if z < 0:
        # If z is negative, we need to adjust the joint angles

        theta2 = math.pi - ry
