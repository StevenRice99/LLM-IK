I'll analyze the forward kinematics results to develop the inverse kinematics solution for both position and orientation. Let me work through this step by step.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. When joints are at (0,0), the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.425] with orientation [0, 0, 0]
2. When joints are at (1.0, 0.5), the TCP is at [0.09650, 0.18018, 0.37297] with orientation [0, 0.5, 1]

Looking at the robot configuration:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z axis
- Joint 2 rotates around Y axis
- The TCP has an offset from joint 2 of [0, -0.1197, 0.425]

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # From the orientation, we can directly determine joint angles
    # Joint 2 (around Y) directly corresponds to ry
    theta2 = ry
    
    # Joint 1 (around Z) directly corresponds to rz
    theta1 = rz
    
    # Verify that the position is consistent with these joint angles
    # We can compute the expected position based on the joint angles
    
    # Position of joint 2 in world frame
    j2_x = -0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    j2_y = 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    j2_z = 0
    
    # Direction of TCP offset in world frame after rotations
    # Rotate around Z by theta1, then around Y by theta2
    tcp_offset_x = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2) * math.cos(theta1) - 0.1197 * math.sin(theta1)
    tcp_offset_y = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2) * math.sin(theta1) + 0.1197 * math.cos(theta1)
    tcp_offset_z = 0.425 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Expected position of TCP
    expected_x = j2_x + tcp_offset_x
    expected_y = j2_y + tcp_offset_y
    expected_z = j2_z + tcp_offset_z
    
    # If the expected position matches the target position, we're done
    # Otherwise, we need to adjust our approach
    
    # Since we're told all targets are reachable, we'll solve for position directly
    # and verify that the orientation is consistent
    
    # Solving for position (similar to the existing solution)
    theta2_pos = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2_pos)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2_pos)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1_pos = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1_pos = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1_pos = math.atan2(sin_theta1_pos, cos_theta1_pos)
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot, we can't independently control both position and orientation
    # Since the problem states all targets are reachable, we'll return the position-based solution
    # which should satisfy the orientation constraints as well
    
    return (theta1_pos, theta2_pos)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. For a 2-DOF robot, we can't independently control both position (3 DOF) and orientation (3 DOF). Let me analyze the problem more carefully.

Looking at the robot configuration again:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z axis
- Joint 2 rotates around Y axis

For a 2-DOF robot, we can only control 2 parameters independently. The forward kinematics shows that when we set joint values, the orientation at the TCP is directly determined by those joint values.

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, the orientation is directly determined by joint angles
    # Joint 2 (around Y) corresponds to ry
    theta2 = ry
    
    # Joint 1 (around Z) corresponds to rz
    theta1 = rz
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
