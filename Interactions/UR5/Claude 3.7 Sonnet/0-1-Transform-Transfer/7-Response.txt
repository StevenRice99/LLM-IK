I see the issue with my previous solution. I was incorrectly assuming that we could directly set the joint angles from the orientation components without considering the position requirements. Let me develop a more comprehensive solution that properly handles both position and orientation.

Looking at the failed test cases and correct joint values, I notice that the inverse kinematics solution needs to account for the relationship between position, orientation, and joint angles in a more sophisticated way.

Let me develop a complete solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # From the robot configuration:
    # - Link 1 (Revolute 1): Position [0, 0, 0], Orientation [0, 0, 0], Axis Z
    # - Link 2 (Revolute 2): Position [0, 0.13585, 0], Orientation [0, 0, 0], Axis Y
    # - TCP: Position [0, -0.1197, 0.425], Orientation [0, 0, 0]
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, the orientation is determined by the joint angles:
    # - Joint 1 (theta1) rotates around Z axis
    # - Joint 2 (theta2) rotates around Y axis
    
    # The orientation [rx, ry, rz] represents the roll, pitch, yaw angles
    # For our robot, we can control pitch (ry) with joint 2 and yaw (rz) with joint 1
    
    # First, determine theta2 based on the z-coordinate and orientation
    # For a target with negative z, we need to flip the orientation
    if z_d < 0:
        # If z is negative, we need to rotate around Y by π (180°) plus the desired pitch
        theta2 = math.pi + ry
    else:
        # If z is positive, we directly use the desired pitch
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Now determine theta1 based on x, y coordinates and orientation
    # For a target with negative z, we need to adjust the yaw angle
    if z_d < 0:
        # If z is negative, we need to rotate around Z by π (180°) plus the desired yaw
        theta1 = math.pi + rz
    else:
        # If z is positive, we directly use the desired yaw
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, this still doesn't fully account for the position requirements. Let me revise my approach by analyzing the forward kinematics more carefully.

Looking at the failed test cases, I notice that when z_d is negative, both joint angles need to be adjusted in a specific way. Let me develop a more comprehensive solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot configuration
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_y = -0.1197  # Y component of TCP in joint 2 frame
    l2_z = 0.425   # Z component of TCP in joint 2 frame
    
    # Check if we need to flip the orientation (for negative z)
    flip = z_d < 0
    
    # Adjust the target position and orientation if needed
    if flip:
        x_d = -x_d
        y_d = -y_d
        z_d = -z_d
        # For orientation, we need to flip around X axis (π rotation)
        ry = -ry
        rz = rz + math.pi if rz <= 0 else rz - math.pi
    
    # Calculate theta2 (joint 2 angle) based on the desired orientation
    theta2 = ry
    
    # Calculate theta1 (joint 1 angle) based on the desired orientation and position
    theta1 = rz
    
    # If we flipped the orientation, adjust the joint angles
    if flip:
        theta1 = theta1 + math.pi if theta1 <= 0 else theta1 - math.pi
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I'm still not fully capturing the relationship between position and orientation. Let me analyze the test cases more carefully and develop a more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Check if we need to flip orientation (for negative z)
    if z < 0:
        # If target z is negative, we need to rotate around X axis by π
        theta2 = math.pi - ry
        theta1 = rz + math.pi
    else:
        theta2 = ry
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Based on the test cases, I see that I need to handle the relationship between position and orientation more carefully. Let me provide a final solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this robot, rx is not directly controllable
    # ry is controlled by joint 2 (theta2)
    # rz is controlled by joint 1 (theta1)
    
    # Check if target z is negative
    if z < 0:
        # If z is negative, we need to flip the orientation
        theta2 = math.pi - ry
        theta1 = rz + math.pi
    else:
        theta2 = ry
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
