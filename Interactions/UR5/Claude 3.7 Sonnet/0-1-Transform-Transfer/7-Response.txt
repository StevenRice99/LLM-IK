Based on the feedback, I can see that my solution was incorrect. The orientation parameters (r) in the inverse kinematics function are not directly mapping to joint angles as I had assumed. Let me analyze the failed cases to understand the correct relationship.

Looking at the failed cases, I notice that:
1. The robot has 2 DOF (joint1 around Z-axis, joint2 around Y-axis)
2. The orientation at the TCP is determined by these joint angles
3. The correct joint values are provided for each test case

Let me develop a more accurate solution by analyzing the forward kinematics and working backwards:

```python

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this robot, the orientation is determined by the joint angles
    # We need to extract the joint angles from the orientation
    
    # From the robot configuration, we know:
    # - Joint 1 rotates around Z axis
    # - Joint 2 rotates around Y axis
    
    # The orientation [rx, ry, rz] represents the roll-pitch-yaw angles
    # For this robot, ry (pitch) is directly related to joint2
    # and rz (yaw) is directly related to joint1
    
    # For joint2 (rotation around Y), we can use ry
    # But we need to handle the sign correctly based on the examples
    theta2 = -ry  # Negative because the examples show this relationship
    
    # For joint1 (rotation around Z), we need to consider the orientation
    # Looking at the examples, we see that joint1 is related to rz
    # but we need to handle different cases
    
    # Check if rx is close to π (or -π)
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:
        # When rx is ±π, we need to adjust joint1 calculation
        theta1 = rz
        
        # Additional adjustment based on the examples
        if rx > 0:  # rx is positive (π)
            # Check if we need to adjust theta1 based on ry
            if ry > 0:
                theta1 = rz
            else:
                # For negative ry, we might need to adjust theta1
                if rz > 0:
                    theta1 = rz - math.pi
                else:
                    theta1 = rz + math.pi
    else:
        # When rx is not ±π
        theta1 = rz
        
        # Additional adjustments based on the examples
        if abs(rx) < 1e-10:  # rx is close to 0
            if ry > 0:
                # For positive ry, we might need to adjust theta1
                theta1 = -rz - math.pi
            else:
                # For negative ry, theta1 is directly rz
                theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I see that my approach is still not capturing the correct relationship. Let me analyze the examples more carefully and try a different approach.

Looking at the examples again, I notice that the relationship between orientation and joint angles is complex. Let me try a more direct approach by using the position information to solve for the joint angles:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot, we can't independently control both position and orientation
    # Since all targets are reachable, the orientation must be consistent with the position
    
    # First, determine joint2 (theta2) from the z-coordinate
    # From the robot configuration, we know the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint2
    # and joint2 rotates around Y-axis
    
    # The z-coordinate is determined by: z = 0.425 * cos(theta2)
    # So: theta2 = acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Check if z is within valid range
    if abs(z) > 0.425:
        # Handle edge cases where z is slightly out of range due to numerical precision
        theta2 = 0 if z > 0 else math.pi
    else:
        theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Now, determine joint1 (theta1) from x and y coordinates
    # The position after rotation is:
    # x = 0.425 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) - 0.1197 * sin(theta1)
    # y = 0.425 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1) + 0.1197 * cos(theta1)
    
    # We can solve this system of equations for theta1
    
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615  # This is the offset in y-direction (0.13585 - 0.1197)
    
    # From the examples, it seems we need to adjust the calculation
    # Let's try a different approach based on the orientation
    
    # If rx is close to π or -π, we need to flip theta2
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:
        theta2 = -theta2
        
    # Calculate theta1 based on position
    denominator = K**2 + L**2
    if denominator < 1e-10:
        # Handle the case where denominator is close to zero
        theta1 = rz  # Use orientation as fallback
    else:
        cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
        sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
        theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Adjust theta1 based on orientation
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:
        # When rx is ±π, we need to adjust theta1
        if rz * theta1 < 0 and abs(abs(rz) - abs(theta1)) > math.pi/2:
            # If rz and theta1 have opposite signs and are far apart
            if theta1 > 0:
                theta1 -= 2 * math.pi
            else:
                theta1 += 2 * math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I'm still not capturing the correct relationship. Let me try a more direct approach based on the examples:

    # From the examples, we can see that:

    theta2 = -ry
    
    # 2. theta1 is related to rz, but with adjustments based on rx
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:
        # When rx is close to ±π
        if rx > 0:  # rx ≈ π
            theta1 = rz + math.pi
