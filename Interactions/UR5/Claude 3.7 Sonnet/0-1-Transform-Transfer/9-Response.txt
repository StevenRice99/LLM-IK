I see that my previous solution is still not correctly handling the relationship between position and orientation. Let me analyze the test cases more carefully to understand the pattern.

Looking at the test cases and correct joint values, I notice that:

1. When z is negative, there's a more complex relationship between the desired orientation and the joint angles.
2. The joint angles need to be calculated based on both position and orientation requirements.

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot configuration
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_y = -0.1197  # Y component of TCP in joint 2 frame
    l2_z = 0.425   # Z component of TCP in joint 2 frame
    
    # First, calculate theta2 based on the z position
    # From the forward kinematics, we know that:
    # z = l2_z * cos(theta2) + l2_y * sin(theta2)
    
    # Rearranging to solve for theta2:
    # z = l2_z * cos(theta2) + l2_y * sin(theta2)
    # z = l2_z * cos(theta2) - 0.1197 * sin(theta2)  (since l2_y = -0.1197)
    
    # This is of the form z = A*cos(theta2) + B*sin(theta2)
    # We can solve this using the tangent half-angle substitution
    
    A = l2_z
    B = l2_y
    
    # Using the tangent half-angle substitution:
    # cos(theta2) = (1 - t²)/(1 + t²) where t = tan(theta2/2)
    # sin(theta2) = 2t/(1 + t²) where t = tan(theta2/2)
    
    # Substituting into our equation:
    # z = A*(1 - t²)/(1 + t²) + B*2t/(1 + t²)
    # z*(1 + t²) = A*(1 - t²) + B*2t
    # z + z*t² = A - A*t² + B*2t
    # z*t² + A*t² - B*2t - A + z = 0
    # (z + A)*t² - 2B*t + (z - A) = 0
    
    # This is a quadratic equation in t: at² + bt + c = 0
    # a = z + A
    # b = -2B
    # c = z - A
    
    # For our specific robot:
    # a = z + 0.425
    # b = 2*0.1197 = 0.2394
    # c = z - 0.425
    
    # The quadratic formula gives us:
    # t = (-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac))/(2a)
    
    # We need to check which solution gives us the correct theta2
    
    # Let's try a different approach based on the test cases
    
    # Looking at the test cases, I notice that when z is negative:
    # 1. If rx is close to π (or -π), we need to adjust both theta1 and theta2
    
    # Let's try a simpler approach based on the patterns in the test cases
    
    if z < 0 and abs(rx) > 3.0:  # If z is negative and rx is close to ±π
        # Calculate theta2 based on ry
        if ry > 0:
            theta2 = math.pi - ry
        else:
            theta2 = -math.pi - ry
        
        # Calculate theta1 based on rz
        if rz > 0:
            theta1 = rz - math.pi
        else:
            theta1 = rz + math.pi
    else:
        # If z is positive or rx is not close to ±π
        theta2 = ry
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After analyzing the test cases more carefully, I see that I need a more comprehensive approach. Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, we need to handle the case where z is negative
    # Looking at the test cases, when z is negative and rx is close to ±π:
    # - theta2 needs to be adjusted based on ry
    # - theta1 needs to be adjusted based on rz
    
    if z < 0 and abs(rx) > 3.0:  # If z is negative and rx is close to ±π
        # For theta2, we need to use π - ry or -π - ry depending on the sign of ry
        theta2 = math.pi - ry if ry > 0 else -math.pi - ry
        
        # For theta1, we need to use rz ± π depending on the sign of rz
        theta1 = rz - math.pi if rz > 0 else rz + math.pi
    else:
        # If z is positive or rx is not close to ±π
        theta2 = ry
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Let me refine this further based on the test cases:

```python

    if z < 0 and abs(rx) > 3.0:  # If z is negative and rx is close to ±π
        # For negative z, we need to flip the orientation
        # This means rotating around the X axis by π
        
        # For theta2, we need to use π - ry or -π - ry depending on the sign of ry
        if abs(ry) < math.pi/2:
            # If ry is close to 0, we use π - ry
            theta2 = math.pi - ry
        else:
            # If ry is close to ±π, we use -π - ry

        else:
            # If rz is close to ±π, we use rz - sign(rz)*π
            theta1 = rz - (math.pi if rz > 0 else -math.pi)
    else:
        # If z is positive or rx is not close to ±π
        theta2 = ry
        theta1 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]

    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After further analysis of the test cases, I see that I need to handle the relationship between position and orientation more carefully. Let me provide a final solution:
