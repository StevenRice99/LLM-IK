I see that my previous approaches were not successful. Let me analyze the examples more carefully to understand the relationship between the orientation parameters and joint angles.

Looking at the failed cases and their correct joint values, I notice that:

1. The relationship between orientation and joint angles is more complex than I initially thought
2. We need to consider all three orientation components (rx, ry, rz) to determine the joint angles

Let me try a different approach by analyzing the forward kinematics of this robot more carefully:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot:
    # - Joint 1 rotates around Z axis
    # - Joint 2 rotates around Y axis
    
    # First, let's determine theta2 (joint2) from the z-coordinate
    # The z-coordinate is related to theta2 by: z = 0.425 * cos(theta2)
    if abs(z) <= 0.425:
        # Normal case
        theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    else:
        # Handle numerical precision issues
        theta2 = 0 if z > 0 else math.pi
    
    # Now, let's determine theta1 (joint1) from x and y coordinates
    # The x and y coordinates are related to theta1 and theta2 by:
    # x = 0.425 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) - 0.1197 * sin(theta1)
    # y = 0.425 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1) + 0.1197 * cos(theta1)
    
    # We can solve this system of equations for theta1
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    A = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    B = 0.1197
    
    # Now we need to determine if we should use theta2 or -theta2 based on orientation
    # Let's check if the orientation matches what we would get with theta2
    
    # Convert orientation to rotation matrix
    # For RPY angles [rx, ry, rz], the rotation matrix is:
    # R = Rz(rz) * Ry(ry) * Rx(rx)
    
    # Function to create rotation matrices
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, math.cos(angle), -math.sin(angle)],
            [0, math.sin(angle), math.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(angle), 0, math.sin(angle)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-math.sin(angle), 0, math.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(angle), -math.sin(angle), 0],

    # For our robot, the rotation is:
    # R_robot = rot_z(theta1) * rot_y(theta2)
    
    # We need to determine if we should use theta2 or -theta2
    # Let's try both and see which one gives a rotation matrix closer to R_rpy
    
    # Try with positive theta2
    R_pos = rot_z(0) @ rot_y(theta2)  # Temporary theta1 = 0
    
    # Try with negative theta2
    R_neg = rot_z(0) @ rot_y(-theta2)  # Temporary theta1 = 0
    
    # Compare the y-axis of the rotation matrices
    # The y-axis of R_rpy should be close to either the y-axis of R_pos or R_neg
    y_axis_rpy = R_rpy[:, 1]
    y_axis_pos = R_pos[:, 1]
    y_axis_neg = R_neg[:, 1]
    
    # Calculate dot products to determine which is closer
    dot_pos = np.abs(np.dot(y_axis_rpy, y_axis_pos))
    dot_neg = np.abs(np.dot(y_axis_rpy, y_axis_neg))
    
    # Choose the theta2 that gives a closer match
    if dot_neg > dot_pos:
        theta2 = -theta2
        A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)  # Update A with new theta2
    
    # Now solve for theta1
    # We have:
    # x = A * cos(theta1) - B * sin(theta1)
    # y = A * sin(theta1) + B * cos(theta1)
    
    # This can be rewritten as:

    # y = C * sin(theta1 + D)
    # where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and D = atan2(B, A)
    
    C = math.sqrt(A**2 + B**2)
    D = math.atan2(B, A)
    
    # If C is very small, we have a singularity
    if C < 1e-10:
        # In this case, we can use the orientation to determine theta1
        theta1 = rz
    else:
        # Otherwise, solve for theta1
        theta1_plus_D = math.atan2(y, x)
        theta1 = theta1_plus_D - D
    
    # Now we need to check if we should use theta1 or theta1 + pi
    # based on the orientation
    
    # Create rotation matrix with current theta1 and theta2
    R_current = rot_z(theta1) @ rot_y(theta2)
    
    # Create rotation matrix with theta1 + pi and theta2
    R_alt = rot_z(theta1 + math.pi) @ rot_y(theta2)

    diff_alt = np.sum(np.abs(R_alt - R_rpy))
    
    if diff_alt < diff_current:
        theta1 += math.pi
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a simpler approach based on the examples:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this robot, the orientation directly determines the joint angles
    # Looking at the examples, we can see that:
    
    # For joint2 (theta2), it's directly related to ry
    theta2 = ry if abs(rx) < math.pi/2 else -ry
    
    # For joint1 (theta1), it's directly related to rz
    theta1 = rz
    
    # But we need to make adjustments based on rx
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:
        # When rx is close to ±π
        if rx > 0:  # rx ≈ π
            if ry < 0:
                theta1 = math.pi - rz
        else:  # rx ≈ -π
            if ry > 0:
                theta1 = -math.pi - rz
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I'm still not capturing the correct relationship. Let me try one more approach by directly using the examples to infer the relationship:

    # 2. For joint1 (theta1), it's related to rz but with adjustments based on rx and ry
    
    # For joint2 (theta2)
    if abs(rx) < 1e-10:  # rx ≈ 0
        theta2 = -ry
    elif abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:  # rx ≈ ±π
        theta2 = ry
    else:
        # For other cases, use position-based calculation
        if abs(z) <= 0.425:
            theta2_pos = math.acos(z / 0.425)
        else:
            theta2_pos = 0 if z > 0 else math.pi
        
        # Determine sign based on orientation
        if (rx > 0 and ry < 0) or (rx < 0 and ry > 0):
            theta2 = -theta2_pos
        else:
            theta2 = theta2_pos
    
    # For joint1 (theta1)
    if abs(rx) < 1e-10:  # rx ≈ 0
        if ry < 0:
            theta1 = rz
        else:
            theta1 = -rz
    elif abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-10:  # rx ≈ ±π
        if ry < 0:
            theta1 = -rz
        else:
            theta1 = rz
    else:
        # For other cases, use position-based calculation
        sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
        A = 0.425 * sin_theta2
        B = 0.1197
        
        C = math.sqrt(A**2 + B**2)
        D = math.atan2(B, A)
        
        if C < 1e-10:
