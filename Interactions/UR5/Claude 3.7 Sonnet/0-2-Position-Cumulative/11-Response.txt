Thank you for the additional feedback. I see that my solution is still not working correctly. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully and develop a better solution.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with the target positions, I notice that:

1. The relationship between joint angles and target positions is more complex than I initially thought
2. There are multiple possible configurations for the same target position
3. I need to properly handle the specific geometry of this robot

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    j2_y = 0.13585      # Y offset of joint 2
    j3_y = -0.1197      # Y offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    j3_z = 0.425        # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    tcp_z = 0.39225     # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    cos_t1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_t1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_in_j1 = px * cos_t1 + py * sin_t1
    y_in_j1 = -px * sin_t1 + py * cos_t1
    z_in_j1 = pz
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset of joint 2
    y_in_j1 = y_in_j1 - j2_y
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator in the YZ plane
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 3)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths in the YZ plane
    l2 = math.sqrt(j3_y**2 + j3_z**2)
    l3 = tcp_z
    
    # Calculate the angle of link 2 in the robot's configuration
    phi = math.atan2(j3_z, j3_y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(y_in_j1**2 + z_in_j1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angles
    # For theta3
    cos_beta = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
    
    # For theta2
    # Calculate the angle to the target from joint 2
    gamma = math.atan2(z_in_j1, y_in_j1)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 2 and the line to the target
    cos_alpha = (l2**2 + d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate theta2 and theta3
    # The signs and offsets depend on the robot's configuration
    theta2 = gamma - alpha + phi
    theta3 = -(math.pi - beta)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. Let me look more carefully at the robot description and the correct joint values.

The robot has:
- Joint 1: Revolute around Z-axis
- Joint 2: Revolute around Y-axis
- Joint 3: Revolute around Y-axis

Let me try a different approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    j2_y = 0.13585      # Y offset of joint 2
    j3_y = -0.1197      # Y offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    j3_z = 0.425        # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    tcp_z = 0.39225     # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Using the existing solution 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, py)
    
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # Using the approach from existing solution 2
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the position in the XZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    # This is similar to the approach in existing solution 2
    theta2 = math.acos(pz / j3_z)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = j3_z * sin_theta2
    L = j2_y
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1_check = (K * px + L * py) / denominator
    sin_theta1_check = (-L * px + K * py) / denominator
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 3
    # We'll use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 3)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths in the YZ plane
    l2 = math.sqrt(j3_y**2 + j3_z**2)
    l3 = tcp_z
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    x_in_j1 = px * cos_theta1 + py * sin_theta1
    y_in_j1 = -px * sin_theta1 + py * cos_theta1
    z_in_j1 = pz
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset of joint 2
    y_in_j1 = y_in_j1 - j2_y
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(y_in_j1**2 + z_in_j1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try one more approach, using the existing solutions as a guide:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Using the existing solution 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1_y = 0.13585      # Y offset of joint 2
    l2_y = -0.1197      # Y offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.425        # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l3_z = 0.39225      # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 3)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP
    
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    sin_t1 = math.sin(theta1)
    cos_t1 = math.cos(theta1)
    x_j1 = x * cos_t1 + y * sin_t1

    z_j1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset of joint 2
    y_j1 = y_j1 - l1_y
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target in the YZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(y_j1**2 + z_j1**2)
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths in the YZ plane
    l2 = math.sqrt(l2_y**2 + l2_z**2)
    l3 = l3_z
    
    # Calculate the angle of link 2 in the robot's configuration
    phi = math.atan2(l2_z, l2_y)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle to the target from joint 2
    gamma = math.atan2(z_j1, y_j1)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 2 and the line to the target
    cos_alpha = (l2**2 + d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = gamma - alpha + phi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me make one final revision to ensure the solution is correct:
