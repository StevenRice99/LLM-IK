Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values and develop a better solution.

Looking at the feedback, I notice several problems with my approach:
1. I didn't properly handle the coordinate transformations
2. I didn't correctly account for the offsets in the robot's structure
3. The planar manipulator solution needs to be revised

Let me develop a correct solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset from joint 3
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 3
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 1 (base)
    # Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    r_xy = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The position of joint 3 needs to be calculated
    # We need to solve the 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # Link 2 length (from joint 2 to joint 3)
    l2 = math.sqrt(0.425**2 + 0.1197**2)
    # Link 3 effective length (from joint 3 to TCP)
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2 relative to the vertical
    # First, find the distance from joint 2 to the target
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0.13585, 0]
    
    # Transform the target to account for the TCP offset
    # We need to find where joint 3 should be
    # The TCP is at the target, so joint 3 is offset by -0.39225 in the direction from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the position of the target in the frame of joint 1
    x_j1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_j1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_j1 = z
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the YZ plane
    # The base of this 2D problem is at joint 2, which is at [0, 0.13585, 0]
    # So we need to adjust y_j1
    y_j1 = y_j1 - 0.13585
    
    # Now we need to solve the inverse kinematics for a 2-link planar manipulator
    # with link lengths l2 and l3, and target position (y_j1, z_j1)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(y_j1**2 + z_j1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Negative because of the robot's configuration
    
    # Now find the angle of joint 2
    # First, calculate the angle from joint 2 to the target
    phi = math.atan2(z_j1, y_j1)
    
    # Then calculate the angle between link 2 and the line from joint 2 to the target
    psi = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    # The angle of joint 2 is the sum of these two angles
    theta2 = phi - psi
    
    # Adjust for the offset angle between joint 2 and link 2
    theta2_offset = math.atan2(0.1197, 0.425)
    theta2 = theta2 + theta2_offset
    
    # Adjust theta3 to account for the angle between links 2 and 3
    theta3 = theta3 - theta2_offset
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider the geometry more carefully. Let me revise:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, we need to find where joint 3 should be to place the TCP at the target
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 3
    # So joint 3 is at target - [0, 0, 0.39225] rotated by joint 3's orientation
    
    # Start by solving for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the XZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0.13585, 0] in the original frame
    # After joint 1 rotation, it's at [0, 0.13585, 0]
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_1 = y_1 - 0.13585
    
    # We need to find where joint 3 should be
    # Joint 3 is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to joint 2
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 3
    
    # We need to solve a 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # Link 2: from joint 2 to joint 3, length = sqrt(0.1197^2 + 0.425^2)
    # Link 3: from joint 3 to TCP, length = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the effective length of link 2
    l2 = math.sqrt(0.1197**2 + 0.425**2)
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(x_1**2 + y_1**2 + z_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    # Project onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x_1**2 + z_1**2)
    phi = math.atan2(z_1, x_1)
    psi = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = phi - psi
    
    # Adjust for the offset angle between joint 2 and link 2
    theta2_offset = math.atan2(0.1197, 0.425)
    theta2 = theta2 - theta2_offset
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to be more precise with the geometry. Let me provide the final solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_1 = y_1 - 0.13585
    
    # We need to solve a 2-link planar manipulator problem in the YZ plane
    # Link 2: from joint 2 to joint 3, length = sqrt(0.1197^2 + 0.425^2)
    # Link 3: from joint 3 to TCP, length = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths and angles
    l2 = math.sqrt(0.1197**2 + 0.425**2)
    l3 = 0.39225
    alpha = math.atan2(0.1197, 0.425)  # Angle between link 2 and the x-axis
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(y_1**2 + z_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_beta = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    gamma = math.atan2(z_1, y_1)
    delta = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(beta), l2 + l3 * math.cos(beta))
    theta2 = gamma - delta - alpha
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 3
    theta3 = math.pi - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me review this solution once more:

The robot has 3 revolute joints:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Z at [0, 0, 0]
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y at [0, 0.13585, 0]
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
4. TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 3

I need to make one more correction to ensure the solution is accurate:

```python
import math

    """

    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
