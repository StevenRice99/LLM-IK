I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator by analyzing the forward kinematics results and building on the existing solutions.

Let's analyze what we've learned from the forward kinematics tests:

1. With all joints at 0 (0,0,0), the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
2. With joint 2 at 90° (0,1.57,0), the TCP is at [0.81725, 0.01615, 0.00065]
3. With joint 3 at 90° (0,0,1.57), the TCP is at [0.39225, 0.01615, 0.42531]

From the robot description and these results, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
- Joints 2 and 3 rotate around Y-axis
- The constant offset in Y (0.01615) comes from the combination of link positions

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This is the same as in the existing solution 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, py)
    
    # Transform the target point to account for joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us the target in the XZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    x_prime = px * math.cos(theta1) + py * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -px * math.sin(theta1) + py * math.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = pz
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset (0.01615) in the manipulator
    y_prime = y_prime - 0.01615
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator in the XZ plane
    # Link lengths: l2 = 0.425, l3 = 0.39225
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using atan2 and the law of sines
    beta = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    gamma = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to double-check this solution. The existing solution 2 uses a different approach for joints 1 and 2. Let me revise my solution to be consistent with the existing code and ensure it's correct for all 3 joints:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, py)
    
    # Transform the target point to account for joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us the target in the XZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    x_prime = px * math.cos(theta1) + py * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -px * math.sin(theta1) + py * math.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = pz
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset (0.01615) in the manipulator
    y_prime = y_prime - 0.01615
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator in the XZ plane
    # Link lengths: l2 = 0.425, l3 = 0.39225
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    # The negative sign is because the joint bends in the opposite direction
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using atan2 and the law of sines
    beta = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    gamma = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(-theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(-theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, let me revise this one more time to ensure it's correct:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, py)
    
    # Adjust the target coordinates to account for joint 1 rotation
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Transform to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    x_prime = px * cos_theta1 + py * sin_theta1
    y_prime = -px * sin_theta1 + py * cos_theta1
    z_prime = pz
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset (0.01615) in the manipulator
    y_prime = y_prime - 0.01615
    
    # For the planar problem in the XZ plane
    # We need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    l2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # The target position in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
