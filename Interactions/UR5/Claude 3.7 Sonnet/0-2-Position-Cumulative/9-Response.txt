Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis
4. The link lengths and offsets match the details provided

Now I'll develop the complete inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    x2 = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1) - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    y2 = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1) - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    z2 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset in the second link
    y2 = y2 - 0.016149999999999998
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    L2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    r = math.sqrt(x2**2 + z2**2)
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using atan2
    beta = math.atan2(z2, x2)
    gamma = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to review this solution more carefully. Let me correct a few issues:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Rotate the target point back to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    x_r = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_r = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_r = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_r = y_r - 0.13585
    
    # Now solve the planar 2R problem for joints 2 and 3
    L2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    d = math.sqrt(x_r**2 + (z_r**2))
    
    # Use law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using atan2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_r, x_r)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me review this solution once more:

The solution needs to account for the fact that joints 2 and 3 rotate around the Y-axis, not the Z-axis. Let me correct this:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Rotate the target point back to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    x_r = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_r = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_r = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_r = y_r - 0.13585
    
    # Now solve the planar 2R problem for joints 2 and 3
    # Since joints 2 and 3 rotate around Y-axis, we work in the x-z plane
    L2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    d = math.sqrt(x_r**2 + z_r**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using atan2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_r, x_r)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
