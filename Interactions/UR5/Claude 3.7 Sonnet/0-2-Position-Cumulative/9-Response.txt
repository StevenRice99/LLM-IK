Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values compared to my solution and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solver.

Looking at the feedback, I notice several key issues:
1. My approach to calculating joint angles isn't correctly handling the robot's geometry
2. There are sign issues and quadrant problems in the calculations
3. I need to properly account for the specific configuration of this robot

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1_y = 0.13585  # Y offset of joint 2 relative to joint 1
    l2_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.425    # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l3_z = 0.39225  # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us coordinates in the YZ plane of joint 1
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)
    
    # The Y coordinate in the joint 1 frame
    y_in_j1 = r - l1_y
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the YZ plane for joints 2 and 3
    # We need to find theta2 and theta3 to reach the point (y_in_j1, pz)
    
    # Calculate the position of the target relative to joint 2
    # We need to account for the offsets in the robot's geometry
    y_rel = y_in_j1 - l2_y
    z_rel = pz - l2_z
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(y_rel**2 + z_rel**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2_z**2 - l3_z**2) / (2 * l2_z * l3_z)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 - note that we need to determine the sign based on the robot configuration
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Negative because of the robot's configuration
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and atan2
    # First, find the angle between the line from joint 2 to the target and the vertical
    phi = math.atan2(y_rel, z_rel)
    
    # Then find the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    # Using the law of sines
    sin_alpha = l3_z * math.sin(-theta3) / d
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for asin
    sin_alpha = max(min(sin_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)
    alpha = math.asin(sin_alpha)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I see some issues with my approach. Let me reconsider the problem more carefully.

The robot has 3 revolute joints:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1_y = 0.13585      # Y offset of joint 2 relative to joint 1
    l2_y = -0.1197      # Y offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.425        # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l3_z = 0.39225      # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    r_xy = math.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset of joint 2
    r_xy_adj = r_xy - l1_y
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 3)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP
    # The wrist center is located at a distance l3_z from the TCP along the arm
    
    # Calculate the unit vector from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    if r_xy > 0:
        ux = px / r_xy
        uy = py / r_xy
    else:
        ux, uy = 0, 0
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position
    # This is a simplification - we need to account for joint 2 and 3 rotations
    # For a more accurate solution, we would need to solve for all joints simultaneously
    
    # Let's try a different approach - solve for joints 2 and 3 directly
    # We know the target position (px, py, pz)
    # We need to find theta2 and theta3 that place the TCP at this position
    
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    x_in_j1 = px * math.cos(theta1) + py * math.sin(theta1)
    y_in_j1 = -px * math.sin(theta1) + py * math.cos(theta1)
    z_in_j1 = pz
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset of joint 2
    y_in_j1 = y_in_j1 - l1_y
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the YZ plane for joints 2 and 3
    # The target is at (y_in_j1, z_in_j1)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(y_in_j1**2 + z_in_j1**2)
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths of the links in the YZ plane
    l2_eff = math.sqrt(l2_y**2 + l2_z**2)
    l3_eff = l3_z
    
    # Calculate the angle of link 2 in the robot's configuration
    alpha2 = math.atan2(l2_z, l2_y)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_beta = (d**2 - l2_eff**2 - l3_eff**2) / (2 * l2_eff * l3_eff)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (the joint angle)
    theta3 = math.pi - beta
    
    # Calculate the angle to the target from joint 2
    gamma = math.atan2(z_in_j1, y_in_j1)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 2 and the line to the target
    cos_delta = (l2_eff**2 + d**2 - l3_eff**2) / (2 * l2_eff * d)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_delta = max(min(cos_delta, 1.0), -1.0)
    delta = math.acos(cos_delta)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = gamma - delta - alpha2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it one more time with a clearer approach:
