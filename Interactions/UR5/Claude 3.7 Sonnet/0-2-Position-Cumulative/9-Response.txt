Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis
4. The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 3

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_1 -= 0.13585
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 (both rotate around Y-axis)
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator in the Y-Z plane
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    r = math.sqrt(x_1**2 + (z_1**2))
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(z_1, x_1)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to review this solution carefully. Let me check the coordinate frames and transformations:

1. The first joint rotates around Z, so theta1 should be atan2(x, y) as I've written.
2. After rotating by theta1, I need to transform the target point to the frame after joint 1.
3. For joints 2 and 3, I need to consider that they both rotate around the Y-axis.

Let me correct the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_1 -= 0.13585
    
    # The remaining problem is a 2-link planar manipulator in the X-Z plane
    # with joint 2 at origin and target at (x_1, z_1)
    l2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    r = math.sqrt(x_1**2 + z_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(z_1, x_1)
    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful with the coordinate frames. Let me revise once more:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Account for the offset of joint 2
    y_2 = y_1 - 0.13585
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we have a 2-link planar manipulator
    # with joint 2 at origin and target at (x_1, z_1 - offset)
    l2 = math.sqrt(0.425**2 + 0.1197**2)  # Effective length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    r = math.sqrt(x_1**2 + y_2**2 + z_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find the angle of joint 2
    # Project onto the plane
    r_proj = math.sqrt(x_1**2 + z_1**2)
    beta = math.atan2(z_1, x_1)
    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to be more precise with the geometry. Let me provide the final correct solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_1 = y_1 - 0.13585
    
    # The remaining problem is a 2-link planar manipulator in the Y-Z plane

    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    r = math.sqrt(y_1**2 + z_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3

    beta = math.atan2(z_1, y_1)
    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, I need to carefully review the robot structure again. Looking at the DETAILS section and the forward kinematics tests:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis at [0, 0, 0]
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at [0, 0.13585, 0]
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
4. TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 3
