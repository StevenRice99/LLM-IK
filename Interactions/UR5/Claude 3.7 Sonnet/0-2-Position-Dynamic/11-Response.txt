Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values and develop a better solution.

Looking at the feedback, I notice several problems with my approach:
1. The sign conventions and coordinate transformations are incorrect
2. I need to handle the joint limits and configurations properly
3. The transformation between coordinate frames needs to be fixed

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_2 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2 along y
    y_offset_3 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3 along y
    z_offset_3 = 0.425    # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3 along z
    z_offset_tcp = 0.39225  # Offset from joint 3 to TCP along z
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_in_1 = c1 * px + s1 * py
    y_in_1 = -s1 * px + c1 * py
    z_in_1 = pz
    
    # Adjust for the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_in_1 = y_in_1 - y_offset_2
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    # We need to solve the 2R planar manipulator in the Y-Z plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(y_in_1**2 + z_in_1**2)
    
    # Link lengths for the 2R planar manipulator
    l1 = math.sqrt(y_offset_3**2 + z_offset_3**2)  # Effective length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l2 = z_offset_tcp  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the angle of the first link relative to the horizontal
    alpha = math.atan2(z_offset_3, y_offset_3)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(z_in_1, y_in_1)
    gamma = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma - alpha
    
    # Adjust the signs based on the robot's configuration
    theta2 = -theta2
    theta3 = -theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p

    j3_y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    j3_z_offset = 0.425    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3

    # The wrist position (joint 3) needs to be calculated from the TCP position
    # We need to solve for the position of joint 3, then use that to find joint angles
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 2 in the robot base frame

    j2_z = 0
    
    # Transform joint 2 position to the frame after joint 1 rotation

    j2_y_1 = -s1 * j2_x + c1 * j2_y
    j2_z_1 = j2_z
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to the target
    dx = x_1 - j2_x_1
    dy = y_1 - j2_y_1
    dz = z_1 - j2_z_1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)

    l2 = tcp_offset  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the first link relative to the horizontal
    alpha = math.atan2(j3_z_offset, j3_y_offset)
    
    # Find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(dz, math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2))
    gamma = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a different approach by analyzing the correct joint values from the feedback:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    j2_offset = 0.13585    # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    j3_y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    j3_z_offset = 0.425    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    tcp_offset = 0.39225   # Offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * px + s1 * py
    y_1 = -s1 * px + c1 * py
    z_1 = pz
    
    # Adjust for the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_1 = y_1 - j2_offset
    
    # Now we have a 2R planar manipulator in the Y-Z plane
    # We need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(y_1**2 + z_1**2)
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = math.sqrt(j3_y_offset**2 + j3_z_offset**2)  # Effective length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l2 = tcp_offset  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Negative because of the robot's configuration
    
    # Find the angle of joint 2
    phi = math.atan2(z_1, y_1)
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(-theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(-theta3))
    
    # Adjust for the angle between link 1 and the Y axis
    alpha = math.atan2(j3_z_offset, j3_y_offset)
    theta2 = phi - psi - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful analysis, I believe the issue is with how I'm handling the geometry of the robot. Let me make one final correction:

```python

    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation

    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3

    theta2 = beta - gamma - alpha
    
    # Based on the robot configuration, we need to adjust the signs
    theta3 = -theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
