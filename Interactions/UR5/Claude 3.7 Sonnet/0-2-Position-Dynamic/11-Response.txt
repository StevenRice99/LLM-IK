Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values compared to my solution and develop a better approach.

The main issues appear to be:
1. The handling of joint 1 rotation
2. The transformation of coordinates between frames
3. The calculation of joint angles 2 and 3

Let me revise my solution completely:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the DETAILS section
    l1_y_offset = 0.13585      # Y offset of joint 2
    l2_y_offset = -0.1197      # Y offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l2_z_offset = 0.425        # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l3_z_offset = 0.39225      # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This puts the target in the plane of joints 2 and 3
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Rotate the target point around Z by -theta1
    x_rot = x * c1 + y * s1
    y_rot = -x * s1 + y * c1
    z_rot = z
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 in the YZ plane
    # The target position relative to joint 2
    y_rel = y_rot - l1_y_offset
    z_rel = z_rot
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (joint 3) relative to joint 2
    # We need to find theta2 and theta3 such that the TCP reaches the target
    
    # First, we'll use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(y_rel**2 + z_rel**2)
    
    # Calculate the lengths of the links
    l2 = math.sqrt(l2_y_offset**2 + l2_z_offset**2)  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = l3_z_offset  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the angle between l2 and the horizontal
    phi2 = math.atan2(l2_z_offset, l2_y_offset)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(z_rel, y_rel)  # Angle from joint 2 to target
    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha - phi2
    
    # Adjust theta3 to account for the offset angle between links
    theta3 = theta3 - math.pi  # Adjust based on the robot configuration
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis with an offset from joint 1
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis with offsets in both Y and Z from joint 2
4. The TCP has a Z offset from joint 3

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the DETAILS section
    j2_offset = 0.13585        # Y offset of joint 2
    j3_y_offset = -0.1197      # Y offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    j3_z_offset = 0.425        # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    tcp_offset = 0.39225       # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    r_xy = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 when the TCP is at the target
    # This requires working backwards from the target
    
    # First, we'll solve for a virtual target that represents where joint 3 needs to be
    # to place the TCP at the desired position
    
    # Transform the target to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # The target in the frame of joint 1
    x1 = x * c1 + y * s1
    y1 = -x * s1 + y * c1
    z1 = z
    
    # Now we need to solve the planar problem in the YZ plane
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y1 = y1 - j2_offset
    
    # The effective lengths of the links in the YZ plane
    l2 = math.sqrt(j3_y_offset**2 + j3_z_offset**2)  # Effective length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = tcp_offset  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # The angle of link 2 relative to the Y-axis when theta2 = 0
    phi2 = math.atan2(j3_z_offset, j3_y_offset)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    d = math.sqrt(y1**2 + z1**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to target
    
    cos_alpha = (d**2 + l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * d * l2)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate the angle from the Y-axis to the target
    gamma = math.atan2(z1, y1)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (the angle of joint 2)
    theta2 = gamma - alpha
    
    # Calculate theta3 (the angle of joint 3 relative to link 2)
    cos_beta = (l2**2 + l3**2 - d**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
    
    # Adjust theta3 based on the robot configuration
    theta3 = math.pi - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it one more time with a clearer approach:

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters

    l2_z = 0.425         # Z offset of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    l3_z = 0.39225       # Z offset of TCP relative to joint 3
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)

    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)

    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_2 = y_1 - l1_y
    z_2 = z_1
    
    # Calculate the position that joint 3 needs to reach
    # This is the target position minus the offset of the TCP from joint 3
    # We need to account for the rotation of joint 3
    
    # We'll solve this using a numerical approach
    # First, calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(y_2**2 + z_2**2)
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths of the links
    l2 = math.sqrt(l2_y**2 + l2_z**2)  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = l3_z                          # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    # First, find the angle from joint 2 to the target
    gamma = math.atan2(z_2, y_2)
    
    # Then find the angle between link 2 and the line from joint 2 to the target
    cos_alpha = (l2**2 + d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range

    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = gamma - alpha
    
    # Adjust for the orientation of the links
    phi2 = math.atan2(l2_z, l2_y)  # Angle of link 2 when theta2 = 0
    theta2 = theta2 - phi2
    
    # Adjust theta3 based on the robot configuration
    theta3 = math.pi - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful analysis of the feedback and the robot structure, here's my final solution:
