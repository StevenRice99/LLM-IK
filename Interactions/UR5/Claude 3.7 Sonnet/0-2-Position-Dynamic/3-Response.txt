I'll analyze the robot's kinematics based on the information provided and develop a solution for the inverse kinematics problem.

Let me first understand the robot structure:
- 3 revolute joints
- Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
- Joints 2 and 3 rotate around Y-axis
- The TCP (Tool Center Point) is at the end of the chain

From the forward kinematics test, I can see that when all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.81725].

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

1. First, I'll handle joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis), which determines the orientation in the XY plane.
2. Then I'll solve for joints 2 and 3 (both rotating around Y-axis) to reach the desired height and distance.

Let's complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Using the solution from EXISTING 1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the XZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    # We need to find the distance from the Z-axis in the rotated frame
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Offsets and link lengths from the robot description
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_offset2 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the y-offsets
    # The effective target for the 2R planar manipulator is in the r-z plane
    z_adj = z - y_offset1
    
    # Now we have a 2R planar manipulator problem in the r-z plane
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint angles
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + z_adj**2)
    
    # Angle for joint 2 using law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Angle for joint 3
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = beta - gamma
    
    # Adjust the signs based on the robot's configuration
    theta2 = -theta2  # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis (determines XY plane position)
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis (affects height and reach)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (affects height and reach)

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the YZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Offsets and link lengths
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_offset2 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # The 2R planar manipulator is now in the r-z plane
    # We need to solve for joints 2 and 3 to reach the point (r, z)
    
    # Adjust z to account for the y-offset of joint 2
    z_adj = z - y_offset1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3
    d_squared = r**2 + z_adj**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the arctan method
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to make one more adjustment to ensure the solution is correct:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the plane after joint 1 rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Offsets and link lengths
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_offset2 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Adjust z to account for the y-offset of joint 2
    z_adj = z - y_offset1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3
    d_squared = r**2 + z_adj**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the arctan method
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me finalize the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    # Transform the target point to the plane after joint 1 rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Offsets and link lengths

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
