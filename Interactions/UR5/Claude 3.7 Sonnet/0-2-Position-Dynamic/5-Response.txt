I see the issues with my solution. Let me analyze the feedback and correct my approach to the inverse kinematics problem.

The main issues appear to be:

1. The handling of joint 1 rotation
2. The calculation of joint angles 2 and 3
3. Properly accounting for the robot's geometry and joint configurations

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # The first joint determines the plane in which the arm operates
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    # We need to work in the plane defined by the first joint
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Robot dimensions from the problem description
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_offset2 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    z_adj = z - y_offset1
    
    # We now have a 2R planar manipulator problem in the r-z plane
    # We need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d_squared = r**2 + z_adj**2
    d = np.sqrt(d_squared)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # Calculate theta3 - this is the angle between links 2 and 3
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to find the angle to the target and adjust for the arm configuration
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Based on the feedback, we need to adjust our solution
    # Looking at the correct values vs. our calculated values, there seems to be 
    # a sign issue and possibly a different configuration choice
    
    # Let's try the other elbow configuration (elbow up vs elbow down)
    theta3 = -theta3
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2_alt = alpha - beta
    
    # Choose the configuration that's closer to the expected values based on feedback
    # For now, let's use the alternative configuration
    theta2 = theta2_alt
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I see that my approach still has issues. Let me revise it completely:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the problem description
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_offset2 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we work in a new coordinate system
    # We need to find the position in this new system
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The target position in the rotated frame
    x_rot = r
    y_rot = 0  # By definition of our rotation
    z_rot = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    z_rot_adj = z_rot - y_offset1
    
    # Now we have a 2R planar manipulator in the x_rot-z_rot plane
    # We need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    d_squared = x_rot**2 + z_rot_adj**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3 (elbow up or elbow down)
    # Based on the feedback, we need to choose the correct one
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)  # Negative for elbow up configuration
    
    # Now find theta2
    # We need to find the angle to the target and adjust for the arm configuration
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_rot_adj, x_rot)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the feedback, I need to make additional adjustments:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the problem description
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_offset2 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, we need to adjust the calculation of theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we work in the plane defined by this rotation
    # The distance from the Z-axis in this plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    z_adj = z - y_offset1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    d_squared = r**2 + z_adj**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # Based on the feedback, we need to determine the correct sign
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful analysis of the feedback and the correct joint values provided, I need to make one final adjustment to my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the problem description
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we work in the plane defined by this rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    z_adj = z - y_offset1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    d_squared = r**2 + z_adj**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Based on the feedback examples, we need to adjust our solution
    # Let's try both possible configurations and choose the one that matches the examples
    
    # Configuration 1: Original calculation
    config1 = (theta1, theta2, theta3)
    
    # Configuration 2: Flipped signs for theta3
    theta3_alt = -theta3
    beta_alt = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3_alt), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3_alt))
    theta2_alt = alpha - beta_alt
    config2 = (theta1, theta2_alt, theta3_alt)
    
    # Based on the feedback examples, config2 seems to match better
    return config2
```

Let me finalize the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the problem description
    y_offset1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l1 = 0.425          # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225        # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we work in the plane defined by this rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    z_adj = z - y_offset1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    d_squared = r**2 + z_adj**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # Calculate theta3 (negative for the correct configuration)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
