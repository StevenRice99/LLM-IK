Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and combine the existing solutions.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joints 2 and 3 rotate around the Y-axis
- The link lengths and offsets match the provided table

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    x_prime = y * math.sin(theta1) - x * math.cos(theta1)
    y_prime = y * math.cos(theta1) + x * math.sin(theta1)
    z_prime = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    y_prime -= 0.13585
    
    # Now solve for joints 2 and 3 in the YZ plane
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    d = math.sqrt(y_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the desired configuration
    # For an elbow-up configuration, we use positive theta3
    # For an elbow-down configuration, we use negative theta3
    # Here we choose the elbow-up configuration
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, y_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to review this solution carefully. Let me check the coordinate frames and transformations:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis, so the atan2 should be atan2(x, y) for the standard convention.
2. After rotating joint 1, I need to transform the target point to the frame of joint 2.
3. For joints 2 and 3, I need to solve the planar 2R manipulator problem.

Let me correct the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # Rotate the point by -theta1 around Z
    x_prime = x * math.cos(-theta1) - y * math.sin(-theta1)
    y_prime = x * math.sin(-theta1) + y * math.cos(-theta1)
    z_prime = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    y_prime -= 0.13585
    
    # Now solve for joints 2 and 3 in the YZ plane
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    d = math.sqrt(y_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, y_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me review this solution once more:

Actually, I need to be more careful with the existing solutions. Let me combine them properly:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (from existing solution 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # Rotate the point by -theta1 around Z
    x_prime = x * math.cos(-theta1) - y * math.sin(-theta1)
    y_prime = x * math.sin(-theta1) + y * math.cos(-theta1)
    z_prime = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    y_prime -= 0.13585
    
    # Now use existing solution 2 for joints 2 and 3
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    d = math.sqrt(y_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the cross product
    cross_product = y_prime * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)) - z_prime * (L2 * math.sin(theta3))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
    
    alpha = math.atan2(y_prime, z_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to be more careful with the coordinate transformations. Let me correct this:

```python
import math

    """

    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = z

    cross_product = y_prime * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)) - z_prime * (L2 * math.sin(theta3))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
    
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, y_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful review, I need to make one more correction to match the existing solutions:

        theta3 = -theta3

    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
