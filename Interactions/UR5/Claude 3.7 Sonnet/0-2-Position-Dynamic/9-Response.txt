Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
4. The robot has offsets between joints and specific link lengths

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # From existing solution 1, we know:
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, py)
    
    # Transform target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This simplifies the problem to a 2D problem in the YZ plane
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_in_1 = c1 * px + s1 * py
    y_in_1 = -s1 * px + c1 * py
    z_in_1 = pz
    
    # Account for the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_in_1 -= 0.13585
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # This is similar to existing solution 2, but with adjusted parameters
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the position of the end effector in the plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_in_1**2 + z_in_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(x_in_1, z_in_1)
    gamma = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to double-check this solution against the robot's structure. Let me review the forward kinematics tests again:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57, the TCP rotates around the Z-axis
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP moves to [0.81725, 0.01615, 0.00065]
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP moves to [0.39225, 0.01615, 0.42531]

Based on this, I need to adjust my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_in_1 = -s1 * px + c1 * py
    y_in_1 = pz
    
    # Account for the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    x_in_1 -= 0.13585
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = math.sqrt(x_in_1**2 + y_in_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(y_in_1, x_in_1)
    gamma = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to make one more correction. After reviewing the robot structure more carefully:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Transform target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_prime = c1 * px + s1 * py
    y_prime = -s1 * px + c1 * py
    z_prime = pz
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2
    y_prime -= 0.13585
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 3
    y_offset_3 = -0.1197
    y_target = y_prime - y_offset_3
    
    # Now solve for joints 2 and 3 in the XZ plane
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from joint 3 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from TCP to joint 3
    
    r = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    gamma = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the robot structure and the forward kinematics tests, I need to make a final correction:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, py)
    
    # Transform target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_prime = c1 * px + s1 * py
    y_prime = -s1 * px + c1 * py
    z_prime = pz
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2
    y_prime = y_prime - 0.13585
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # This is a 2R planar manipulator in the X-Z plane
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to TCP

    r = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)

    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    gamma = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
