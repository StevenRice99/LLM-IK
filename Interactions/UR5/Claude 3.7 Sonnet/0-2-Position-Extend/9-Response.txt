Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
4. The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to link 3

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, we need to find the position of the wrist (joint 3) given the TCP position
    # The TCP is 0.39225 units along the z-axis of joint 3
    # When joint 3 is at angle theta3, this offset creates a displacement
    
    # We need to solve for the position of joint 3 first
    # Let's define the distance from joint 3 to TCP
    L3_TCP = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target point
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    L2_3 = math.sqrt(0.425**2 + 0.1197**2)

    alpha = math.atan2(0.1197, 0.425)
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to joint 2
    L1_2 = 0.13585
    
    # First, find theta1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Project the target point onto the XZ plane of the first joint
    r_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 by subtracting the TCP offset
    # We need to account for the orientation of joint 3
    # For simplicity, let's first solve for the case where joint 3 is at angle 0
    
    # The law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 first
    # When joint 3 is at angle theta3, the TCP is offset by L3_TCP in that direction
    
    # We need to solve the triangle formed by joint 2, joint 3, and the target
    # First, we need to find the distance from joint 2 to the target
    
    # Calculate the coordinates in the plane defined by joint 1
    # We need to work in the plane defined by the target point and the Z-axis
    
    # The distance from origin to the projection of the target on the XY plane
    d_xy = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # We need to solve for joint angles that will place the TCP at the target position
    # The TCP is at position [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 3
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # If joint 3 is at angle theta3, then the TCP is offset by L3_TCP in that direction
    
    # Let's solve this by working backwards from the target position
    # We know that the TCP is L3_TCP away from joint 3 in the direction of joint 3's z-axis
    
    # First, let's determine theta1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Now we need to solve for theta2 and theta3
    # We'll use the approach from the existing solution but extend it for the full chain
    
    # The existing solution solved for a 2-link chain where the target was at joint 3
    # Now we need to account for the third link and the TCP
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # This is a reverse kinematics problem from the TCP to joint 3
    
    # Let's define the position of joint 3 as p3 = [x3, y3, z3]
    # When joint 3 is at angle theta3, the TCP is offset by L3_TCP in that direction
    
    # For a given theta3, the TCP position relative to joint 3 is:
    # [L3_TCP * sin(theta3), 0, L3_TCP * cos(theta3)] in joint 3's local frame
    
    # We need to solve for theta3 such that when we add this offset to joint 3's position,
    # we get the target position p = [x, y, z]
    
    # Let's use an iterative approach to solve for theta2 and theta3
    # We'll start with an initial guess for theta3 and refine it
    
    # Actually, we can solve this analytically
    # The position of the TCP in the base frame is the sum of all the transformations
    
    # Let's solve this step by step
    # First, we'll find the position of joint 3 given the target TCP position
    
    # We know that:
    # p = p3 + R3 * [0, 0, L3_TCP]
    # where R3 is the rotation matrix for joint 3
    
    # For a 3-DOF robot with revolute joints, we can solve this analytically
    
    # Let's use the approach from the existing solution but extend it
    
    # First, we need to find the position of the wrist center (joint 3)
    # The wrist center is offset from the TCP by L3_TCP in the direction of joint 3's z-axis
    
    # Let's calculate the wrist center position
    # For a given target position p = [x, y, z]
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to the target
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target position to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # This is the XZ plane after rotating by theta1
    x_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Projection of the target onto the XY plane
    z_proj = z
    
    # Now we need to solve for theta2 and theta3
    # We'll use the approach from the existing solution but account for the TCP offset
    
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, L3_TCP] relative to joint 3
    # When joint 3 is at angle theta3, this creates an offset
    
    # Let's calculate the position of joint 3 given the target TCP position
    # We need to account for both theta2 and theta3
    
    # For simplicity, let's define:
    L1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.425    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in z direction
    L2_y = -0.1197  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in y direction
    L3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # We need to solve for the position of joint 3 first
    # Then we can use the existing solution approach to find theta2 and theta3
    
    # Let's solve this geometrically
    # First, find theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Now, we need to find the wrist center (joint 3 position)
    # We know the TCP position and need to work backwards
    
    # The TCP is at the target position [x, y, z]
    # Joint 3 is L3 units away from the TCP in the direction determined by theta3
    
    # Let's use a different approach
    # We know the forward kinematics equations:
    # x = (L2*sin(theta2) + L3*sin(theta2+theta3))*cos(theta1)
    # y = (L2*sin(theta2) + L3*sin(theta2+theta3))*sin(theta1)
    # z = L1 + L2*cos(theta2) + L3*cos(theta2+theta3)
    
    # We need to solve these equations for theta1, theta2, and theta3
    
    # First, theta1 is straightforward:
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Now, let's solve for theta2 and theta3
    # We'll use the projection of the target onto the plane defined by theta1
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Horizontal distance from origin to target
    
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3 using the projected coordinates [r, z]
    
    # Let's define the effective lengths accounting for the offsets
    L2_eff = math.sqrt(L2**2 + L2_y**2)
    phi = math.atan2(-L2_y, L2)  # Angle offset for L2
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + (z-L1)**2 - L2_eff**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2_eff * L3)
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * sin_theta3, L2_eff + L3 * cos_theta3)
    gamma = math.atan2(z - L1, r)
    theta2 = gamma - beta + phi
    
    # Adjust theta3 to account for the offset angle phi
    theta3 = theta3 - phi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me think more carefully about the geometry of this robot.

Looking at the forward kinematics tests and the robot description:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis (after joint 1's rotation)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (after joint 2's rotation)
4. The TCP is 0.39225 units along the z-axis from joint 3

Let me provide a cleaner, more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, find theta1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target position to the plane after rotating by theta1
    # This is the plane where joints 2 and 3 operate
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Projection of the target onto the XY plane
    
    # Define the link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 in z direction
    L2 = 0.425    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in z direction
    L2_y = -0.1197  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in y direction
    L3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the effective length of link 2 (from joint 2 to joint 3)
    L2_eff = math.sqrt(L2**2 + L2_y**2)
    # Calculate the angle offset of link 2
    phi = math.atan2(L2_y, L2)
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + (z - L1)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2_eff**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2_eff * L3)
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines and angles
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * sin_theta3, L2_eff + L3 * cos_theta3)
    gamma = math.atan2(z - L1, r)
    theta2 = gamma - beta
    
    # Adjust theta3 to account for the joint configuration
    # In this robot, theta3 is relative to theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to refine this solution further. Let me reconsider the geometry and the forward kinematics tests.

Here's my final solution:
