I see the issues with my previous solution. Let me analyze the feedback and develop a correct inverse kinematics solution.

The main problems appear to be:
1. Incorrect handling of the robot's geometry
2. Issues with joint angle calculations
3. Not properly accounting for multiple possible solutions

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    h1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.425    # Z component of link 2
    d2 = -0.1197  # Y component of link 2 (negative in the URDF)
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us the distance from the Z-axis
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the r-z plane
    # We need to find the position of the wrist (joint 3) relative to joint 2
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths of the links
    len2 = np.sqrt(l2**2 + d2**2)
    len3 = l3
    
    # Calculate the angle offset for link 2 due to its geometry
    phi2 = np.arctan2(l2, d2)
    
    # Adjust z coordinate relative to joint 2
    z_adj = z - h1
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - len2**2 - len3**2) / (2 * len2 * len3)
    
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)
    # We choose the elbow-up configuration based on the feedback
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (angle of joint 2)
    # First, find the angle to the target from joint 2
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    
    # Then find the angle in the triangle formed by links 2, 3, and the line to the target
    gamma = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3))
    
    # Combine these angles and adjust for the link 2 geometry
    theta2 = beta - gamma + phi2
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the joint limits
    theta1 = ((theta1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    theta3 = ((theta3 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach based on the feedback. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided:

1. For some targets, the correct theta3 is negative, while for others it's positive
2. The relationship between theta1 and the target's x,y coordinates isn't always straightforward
3. There seems to be multiple possible configurations for the same target

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    h1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.425    # Z component of link 2
    d2 = -0.1197  # Y component of link 2 (negative in the URDF)
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    if abs(x) < 1e-10 and abs(y) < 1e-10:
        # Special case: target is on the Z-axis
        theta1 = 0
    else:
        theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us the distance from the Z-axis
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths of the links
    len2 = np.sqrt(l2**2 + d2**2)
    len3 = l3
    
    # Calculate the angle offset for link 2 due to its geometry
    phi2 = np.arctan2(l2, -d2)  # Note the negative d2
    
    # Adjust z coordinate relative to joint 2
    z_adj = z - h1
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - len2**2 - len3**2) / (2 * len2 * len3)
    
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Based on the feedback, we need to determine whether to use positive or negative theta3
    # Let's try both and see which one gives a better result
    
    # For positive theta3
    beta_pos = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma_pos = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2_pos = beta_pos - gamma_pos + phi2
    
    # For negative theta3
    theta3_neg = -theta3
    gamma_neg = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3_neg), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3_neg))
    theta2_neg = beta_pos - gamma_neg + phi2
    
    # Choose the configuration that better reaches the target
    # For this, we'll compute the forward kinematics for both configurations
    
    # Let's use the negative theta3 configuration based on the feedback patterns
    theta2 = theta2_neg
    theta3 = theta3_neg
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I see that I need to make further adjustments. Let me finalize the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    h1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.425    # Z component of link 2
    d2 = 0.1197   # Y component of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths of the links
    len2 = np.sqrt(l2**2 + d2**2)
    len3 = l3
    
    # Calculate the angle offset for link 2 due to its geometry
    phi2 = np.arctan2(l2, d2)
    
    # Adjust z coordinate relative to joint 2
    z_adj = z - h1
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - len2**2 - len3**2) / (2 * len2 * len3)
    
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (angle of joint 2)
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma - phi2
    
    # Based on the feedback, we need to adjust our solution
    # Let's try the other elbow configuration
    if z < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
        gamma = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3))
        theta2 = beta - gamma - phi2
    
    # If the target is behind the robot, we need to flip theta1
    if r < 0:
        theta1 = theta1 + np.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the feedback, I need to make one final correction:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """

    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Calculate the effective lengths of the links
    len2 = np.sqrt(l2**2 + d2**2)
    len3 = l3
    
    # Calculate the angle offset for link 2 due to its geometry
    phi2 = np.arctan2(l2, d2)
    
    # Adjust z coordinate relative to joint 2
    z_adj = z - h1
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - len2**2 - len3**2) / (2 * len2 * len3)
    
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)  # Using negative arccos for elbow-down configuration
    
    # Calculate theta2 (angle of joint 2)
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma - phi2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
