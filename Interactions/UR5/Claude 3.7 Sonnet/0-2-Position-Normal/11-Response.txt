I see the issues with my solution. Let me analyze the failures and develop a correct inverse kinematics solution.

The main problems with my previous solution appear to be:

1. Not properly handling the multiple possible configurations (elbow up vs. elbow down)
2. Not correctly accounting for the joint orientations and link offsets
3. Issues with angle ranges and quadrant selection

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the URDF
    joint2_offset = 0.13585  # Z offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    joint3_y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 3 from joint 2
    joint3_z_offset = 0.425  # Z offset of joint 3 from joint 2
    tcp_z_offset = 0.39225  # Z offset of TCP from joint 3
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the XZ plane after rotation by theta1
    # This is the plane where joints 2 and 3 operate
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust target position to account for joint 2's height
    target_r = r
    target_z = z - joint2_offset
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (joint 3) relative to joint 2
    # We need to solve for joint angles that place joint 3 in a position
    # such that the TCP can reach the target
    
    # First, calculate the vector from joint 3 to TCP in the local frame
    # when all joints are at zero
    # We need to transform this based on joint 3 angle
    
    # This is a 2D problem in the r-z plane now
    # We need to find joint 2 and 3 angles that position the TCP at (target_r, target_z)
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (in the r-z plane when joints are at zero)
    l2 = np.sqrt(joint3_y_offset**2 + joint3_z_offset**2)
    
    # Angle of joint 3 link relative to joint 2 when at zero position
    alpha2 = np.arctan2(joint3_z_offset, joint3_y_offset)
    
    # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    l3 = tcp_z_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = np.sqrt(target_r**2 + target_z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between the links
    # at joint 3
    cos_phi = (l2**2 + l3**2 - d**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_phi = np.clip(cos_phi, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    
    # The internal angle at joint 3
    phi = np.arccos(cos_phi)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (joint 3 angle)
    # When joint 3 is at zero, the TCP extends along the z-axis of joint 3
    # phi is the internal angle, we need to convert to joint angle
    theta3 = np.pi - phi
    
    # Now calculate theta2 (joint 2 angle)
    # First, find the angle from horizontal to the line from joint 2 to target
    psi = np.arctan2(target_z, target_r)
    
    # Then find the angle from horizontal to the line from joint 2 to joint 3
    # when the internal angle at joint 3 is phi
    # Use the law of sines
    sin_gamma = l3 * np.sin(phi) / d
    sin_gamma = np.clip(sin_gamma, -1.0, 1.0)
    gamma = np.arcsin(sin_gamma)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = psi - gamma - alpha2
    
    # Adjust angles based on the correct configuration
    # This is determined by comparing with the provided correct solutions
    
    # Check if we need to use the "elbow down" configuration
    # This is a heuristic based on the failed examples
    if z < 0 and target_z < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
        theta2 = psi + gamma - alpha2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The failures show that my approach isn't handling all cases correctly. Let me revise with a more comprehensive understanding of the robot's kinematics:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the URDF
    d1 = 0.13585  # Z offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    a2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    a3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (joint 3 to TCP)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # after rotation by theta1
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 2 and 3
    # Adjust for the height of joint 2
    target_r = r
    target_z = z - d1
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from joint 2 to the target
    d_squared = target_r**2 + target_z**2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3 (elbow up or elbow down)
    # Based on the failed examples, we need to choose the appropriate one
    # Let's try the negative solution first (elbow up)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle from the horizontal to the line from joint 2 to target
    beta = np.arctan2(target_z, target_r)
    
    # Then find the angle from the horizontal to the line from joint 2 to joint 3
    gamma = np.arctan2(a3 * np.sin(theta3), a2 + a3 * np.cos(theta3))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the joint limits
    theta1 = ((theta1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    theta3 = ((theta3 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After analyzing the failures more carefully, I see that I need to handle the elbow configurations differently. Let me make one final revision:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the URDF
    d1 = 0.13585  # Z offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    a2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    a3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (joint 3 to TCP)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # after rotation by theta1
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 2 and 3
    # Adjust for the height of joint 2
    target_r = r
    target_z = z - d1
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from joint 2 to the target
    d_squared = target_r**2 + target_z**2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 - we'll determine the sign later
    theta3_abs = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now calculate theta2 for both possible theta3 values
    # First, find the angle from the horizontal to the line from joint 2 to target
    beta = np.arctan2(target_z, target_r)
    
    # Calculate for positive theta3 (elbow down)
    gamma_pos = np.arctan2(a3 * np.sin(theta3_abs), a2 + a3 * np.cos(theta3_abs))
    theta2_pos = beta - gamma_pos
    
    # Calculate for negative theta3 (elbow up)
    gamma_neg = np.arctan2(a3 * np.sin(-theta3_abs), a2 + a3 * np.cos(-theta3_abs))
    theta2_neg = beta - gamma_neg
    
    # Choose the configuration that keeps the arm in front
    # This is a heuristic based on the failed examples
    if target_z < 0:
        # For targets below the base, prefer elbow up configuration
        theta3 = -theta3_abs
        theta2 = theta2_neg
    else:
        # For targets above the base, prefer elbow down configuration
        theta3 = theta3_abs
        theta2 = theta2_pos
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the failures, I need to make a more sophisticated decision about which configuration to use:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    """

    a2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    a3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (joint 3 to TCP)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # after rotation by theta1
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 2 and 3
    # Adjust for the height of joint 2
    target_r = r
    target_z = z - d1
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from joint 2 to the target
    d_squared = target_r**2 + target_z**2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 - we'll determine the sign based on the target position
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # For targets below the base plane, use negative theta3
    if z < d1:
        theta3 = -theta3
    
    # Now calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle from the horizontal to the line from joint 2 to target
    beta = np.arctan2(target_z, target_r)
    
    # Then find the angle from the horizontal to the line from joint 2 to joint 3
