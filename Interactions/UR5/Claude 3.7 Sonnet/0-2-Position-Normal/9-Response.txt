I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can analyze the robot's structure and movement patterns.

Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, I'll analyze the robot's structure:
   - Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
   - Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
   - Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis
   - The links form a serial chain with specific offsets

2) From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how each joint affects the end-effector position.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform target point to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # This gives us the distance from the base in the direction of the arm
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    joint2_offset = 0.13585
    
    # The remaining problem is a 2-link planar arm in the r-z plane
    # with link lengths l2 and l3
    l2 = 0.425  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Adjust target position to account for joint 2's height offset
    z_adj = z - joint2_offset
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    # cos(theta3) = (r² + z_adj² - l2² - l3²) / (2*l2*l3)
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Joint 3 rotates in the opposite direction in the robot's configuration
    theta3 = -theta3
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines
    # We can use atan2 to find the angle to the target in the r-z plane
    # and then adjust for the arm's configuration
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    
    # Calculate gamma using the law of sines
    gamma = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(-theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(-theta3))
    
    # Theta2 is the angle needed to point the first link toward the target
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates theta1 based on the x-y position (rotation around Z-axis)
2. Transforms the problem to a 2D planar problem in the r-z plane
3. Uses the law of cosines to find theta3
4. Uses geometry to determine theta2

The solution handles the specific offsets of the robot's links and accounts for the orientation of the joints.
