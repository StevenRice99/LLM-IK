I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can analyze the robot's structure and movement patterns.

Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, I'll analyze the robot's structure:
   - Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
   - Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
   - Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis
   - The links form a serial chain with specific offsets

2) From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how each joint affects the end-effector position.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform target point to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # This gives us the distance from the base in the direction of the arm
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    joint2_height = 0.13585
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 2 and 3 (in the rotated plane)
    target_r = r
    target_z = z - joint2_height
    
    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.425  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    # Distance squared to the target
    d_squared = target_r**2 + target_z**2
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using geometry
    beta = np.arctan2(target_z, target_r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to check something. The forward kinematics tests show that joint 3 affects the end-effector position differently than I initially thought. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform target point to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Offset of joint 2 from the base
    joint2_height = 0.13585
    
    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.425  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 2 and 3 (in the rotated plane)
    target_r = r
    target_z = z - joint2_height
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    d_squared = target_r**2 + target_z**2
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    # Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis, so the angle is negative
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using geometry
    beta = np.arctan2(target_z, target_r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful about the signs of the angles. Let me revise one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform target point to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # After rotation by theta1, we work in the r-z plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Offset of joint 2 from the base
    joint2_height = 0.13585
    
    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.425  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 2 and 3 (in the rotated plane)
    target_r = r
    target_z = z - joint2_height
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    d_squared = target_r**2 + target_z**2
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using geometry
    beta = np.arctan2(target_z, target_r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
