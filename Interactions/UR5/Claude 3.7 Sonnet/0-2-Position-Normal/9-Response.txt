I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot manipulator. Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can determine how each joint affects the end-effector position.

Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints:
   - Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
   - Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
   - Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis

2. The link dimensions are:
   - Link 1: [0, 0.13585, 0]
   - Link 2: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
   - Link 3 (to TCP): [0, 0, 0.39225]

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    x_prime = x * np.cos(theta1) + y * np.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -x * np.sin(theta1) + y * np.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = z
    
    # The remaining problem is a 2-DOF planar manipulator in the X'Z' plane
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Z offset of joint 2
    l2 = np.sqrt(0.1197**2 + 0.425**2)  # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Angle offset for link 2 due to its geometry
    alpha = np.arctan2(0.425, 0.1197)
    
    # Calculate the position of the end effector relative to joint 2
    r = np.sqrt(x_prime**2 + (z_prime - l1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and arctangent
    beta = np.arctan2(z_prime - l1, x_prime)
    gamma = np.arcsin(l3 * np.sin(theta3) / r)
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Adjust theta2 and theta3 to account for the link geometry
    theta2 = theta2 - alpha
    theta3 = np.pi - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57 (90°), the TCP rotates around the Z-axis
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57 (90°), the TCP moves to [0.81725, 0.01615, 0.00065]
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57 (90°), the TCP moves to [0.39225, 0.01615, 0.42531]

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Distance from origin to target in XY plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    d2 = 0.1197   # Y offset of joint 3 from joint 2
    
    # The remaining problem is a 2-DOF planar manipulator in the RZ plane
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the offset in link 2
    z_adj = z - l1
    r_adj = r
    
    # Calculate the position for the elbow (joint 3)
    # We need to solve the triangle formed by joints 2, 3, and the target
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    D = (r_adj**2 + z_adj**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    D = np.clip(D, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3
    theta3 = np.arccos(D)  # Elbow up configuration
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and arctangent
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r_adj)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me complete the final solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Distance from origin to target in XY plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Link dimensions
    h1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.425    # Z component of link 2
    d2 = 0.1197   # Y component of link 2 (negative in the URDF)
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the joint 1 rotation
    # We're now working in the plane defined by the arm after joint 1 rotation
    
    # The problem is now a 2-DOF planar manipulator
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3
    
    # First, we need to find the coordinates in the plane
    z_adj = z - h1
    
    # Calculate the lengths of the links in the plane
    len2 = np.sqrt(l2**2 + d2**2)
    len3 = l3
    
    # Calculate the angle offset for link 2 due to its geometry
    phi2 = np.arctan2(l2, d2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - len2**2 - len3**2) / (2 * len2 * len3)
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Elbow down configuration
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma - phi2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis, I need to make one more correction to account for the specific geometry of this robot:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Distance from origin to target in XY plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Link dimensions
    h1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.425    # Z component of link 2

    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # The problem is now a 2-DOF planar manipulator
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3
    
    # First, we need to find the coordinates in the plane
    z_adj = z - h1
    
    # Calculate the lengths of the links in the plane
    len2 = np.sqrt(l2**2 + d2**2)
    len3 = l3
    
    # Calculate the angle offset for link 2 due to its geometry
    phi2 = np.arctan2(l2, d2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - len2**2 - len3**2) / (2 * len2 * len3)
    # Clamp to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Elbow down configuration (based on the robot's design)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(len3 * np.sin(theta3), len2 + len3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Adjust theta2 to account for the link geometry
    theta2 = theta2 - phi2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me finalize the solution:
