I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can analyze the robot's structure and movement patterns.

Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, I'll analyze the robot structure:
   - Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis (base rotation)
   - Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis (shoulder)
   - Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (elbow)
   - The links form a serial chain with specific dimensions

2) From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how each joint affects the end-effector position.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XY plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    # The height of joint 2 is 0.13585
    z_adj = z - 0.13585
    
    # The robot has two links after joint 2:
    # Link 2 length: 0.425 (from joint 2 to joint 3)
    # Link 3 length: 0.39225 (from joint 3 to TCP)
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    D = np.sqrt(r**2 + z_adj**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_adj**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    # Joint 3 angle (negative because of the robot's configuration)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using the law of sines and arctangent
    beta = np.arctan2(z_adj, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(L3 * np.sin(-theta3), L2 + L3 * np.cos(-theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates theta1 (joint 1) based on the target's position in the XY plane
2. Computes the planar distance from the base to the target
3. Adjusts the Z coordinate to account for the height of joint 2
4. Uses the law of cosines to find theta3 (joint 3)
5. Calculates theta2 (joint 2) using the law of sines and arctangent

The solution handles the specific geometry of this robot and returns the joint angles in radians as required.
