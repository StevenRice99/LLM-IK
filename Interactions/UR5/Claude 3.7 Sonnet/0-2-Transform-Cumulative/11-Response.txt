Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I notice several key issues:

1. The relationship between the target position and joint angles is more complex than I initially modeled
2. I need to properly account for the robot's specific geometry and joint configurations
3. My approach to calculating joint 3 and the subsequent joint 2 needs revision

Let me develop a corrected solution:
