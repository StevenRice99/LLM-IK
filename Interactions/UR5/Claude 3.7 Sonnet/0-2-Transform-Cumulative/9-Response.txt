Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints with the following configuration:
   - Joint 1: Rotates around Z-axis at origin
   - Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis, offset by [0, 0.13585, 0] from joint 1
   - Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis, offset by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] from joint 2
   - TCP: Offset by [0, 0, 0.39225] from joint 3

2. From the forward kinematics tests:
   - When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
   - Joint 1 rotation affects the X-Y plane position
   - Joints 2 and 3 affect the robot's reach in the X-Z plane

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Using the solution from existing code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2 in Z direction
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # The target position in the XZ plane of joint 2's frame
    # We need to solve for joint 2 and 3 to reach this point
    x_2 = math.sqrt(x_1**2 + (y_1 - l1)**2)
    z_2 = z_1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3
    d = math.sqrt(x_2**2 + z_2**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to target
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle using law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (x_2**2 + z_2**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    beta = math.atan2(z_2, x_2)
    gamma = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Adjust joint 3 to be relative to joint 2
    theta3 = -theta3  # Negative because joint 3 bends in the opposite direction
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When joint 2 is at 1.57 (90 degrees), the TCP moves primarily in the X direction
2. When joint 3 is at 1.57 (90 degrees), the TCP also moves in the X direction

Let me revise the solution:

```python

    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_1 = y_1 - 0.13585
    
    # The position is now in the reference frame of joint 2
    # We need to solve for joint 2 and 3 to reach this point
    
    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully based on the forward kinematics tests:
