Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints with the following configuration:
   - Joint 1: Rotates around Z-axis at origin
   - Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis, offset by [0, 0.13585, 0]
   - Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis, offset by [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
   - TCP: Final offset by [0, 0, 0.39225]

2. From the forward kinematics tests:
   - When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
   - Joint 1 rotation affects the X-Y plane orientation
   - Joints 2 and 3 affect the arm's reach in the X-Z plane

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Adjust coordinates to account for joint 1 rotation
    # Transform target point to the reference frame after joint 1 rotation
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = z
    
    # Link lengths from the robot description
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # The y_offset is the y-coordinate of the TCP in the local frame
    y_offset = 0.01615  # From forward kinematics when all joints are 0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the y_offset
    y_prime = y_prime - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + (z_prime - l1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    beta = math.atan2(z_prime - l1, x_prime)
    gamma = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When joint 1 is at 1.57 (90 degrees), the TCP moves to the negative X direction, confirming it rotates around Z.
2. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP moves primarily in the X direction with Z near 0, showing it's a Y-axis rotation.
3. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP has significant X and Z components, also confirming Y-axis rotation.

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the reference frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1 * x + s1 * y
    y_1 = -s1 * x + c1 * y
    z_1 = z
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset in the robot's structure
    y_offset = 0.01615  # From forward kinematics when all joints are 0
    y_1 = y_1 - y_offset
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 2 and 3 is now (x_1, z_1)
    # We need to solve the 2-link planar manipulator problem in the X-Z plane
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (to TCP)
    
    # Target position for the 2-link manipulator
    x_target = x_1
    z_target = z_1 - l1  # Adjust for the height of joint 2
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    d = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    beta = math.atan2(z_target, x_target)
    gamma = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution should work for the given robot configuration, but I need to make one more adjustment. Based on the forward kinematics tests, it appears that joint 3 has a different orientation than I initially thought. Let me finalize the solution:

    # Transform the target point to the reference frame after joint 1 rotation
