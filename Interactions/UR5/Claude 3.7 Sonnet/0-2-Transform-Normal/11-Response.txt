I see the issues with my inverse kinematics solution. Let me analyze the feedback and develop a corrected solution. The main problems appear to be related to:

1. Handling multiple possible solutions (elbow up vs. elbow down configurations)
2. Properly accounting for the robot's specific geometry
3. Handling the orientation constraints correctly

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.425    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction when joint 2 = 0)
    d2 = -0.1197  # Offset in y-direction from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (z-direction when joint 3 = 0)
    
    # For this robot, joint 1 controls the rotation around the Z-axis
    # The orientation around Z (rz) directly determines joint 1
    theta1 = rz
    
    # Rotate the target position back by -theta1 to work in the plane of joints 2 and 3
    x_rot = x * np.cos(-theta1) - y * np.sin(-theta1)
    y_rot = x * np.sin(-theta1) + y * np.cos(-theta1)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 in the XZ plane
    # The target position in this plane is (x_rot, z)
    
    # We need to account for the TCP orientation (ry) which affects joint 3
    # Joint 3 angle is directly related to the Y-axis rotation in the target orientation
    theta3 = -ry
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 2
    # First, calculate the position of joint 3 given theta3
    # When theta3 = 0, the TCP extends l3 in the z-direction from joint 3
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 by working backwards from the target
    # The TCP is offset from joint 3 by l3 in a direction determined by theta3
    x3 = x_rot - l3 * np.sin(theta3)
    z3 = z - l3 * np.cos(theta3)
    
    # Now we need to find theta2 such that joint 3 is at position (x3, z3)
    # We have a simple 2D problem: joint 2 is at (0, l1) and we need to reach (x3, z3)
    # with a link of length l2
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the desired joint 3 position
    dx = x3
    dz = z3 - l1
    d = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > l2:
        # Target is too far, set joint 2 to point in the direction of the target
        theta2 = np.arctan2(dz, dx)
    else:
        # Use inverse kinematics to find theta2
        theta2 = np.arctan2(dz, dx) - np.arcsin(0)  # No offset needed since we're directly solving for joint 3 position
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me correct it:

    x3 = x_rot - l3 * np.sin(ry)

    # Now we need to find theta2 such that joint 3 is at position (x3, z3)

    # The angle of the triangle formed by joint 2, joint 3, and the horizontal
    cos_alpha = (l2**2 + d**2 - 0) / (2 * l2 * d)  # No third side in this case

I need to refine this solution one more time:

    # Return the joint angles

```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I see that I need to account for the specific geometry of this robot. Let me provide the final corrected solution:
