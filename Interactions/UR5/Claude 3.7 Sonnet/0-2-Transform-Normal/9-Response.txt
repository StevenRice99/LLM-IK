Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the equations.

From the tests, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joints 2 and 3 rotate around the Y-axis
- The robot has a serial chain configuration with specific link lengths

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.13585  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.425    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-component)
    d2 = 0.1197   # Offset in y-direction from joint 2 to joint 3 (negative in the table)
    l3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform target position to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The position of joint 3 needs to be calculated to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # We need to account for the TCP orientation (r[0], r[1], r[2])
    # For simplicity, we'll focus on position-only inverse kinematics
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (joint 3) by moving back from TCP
    # This is a simplification assuming orientation is achievable
    # In a full solution, we would use the orientation matrix
    
    # For a Y-axis rotation at joint 3, the TCP extends along a direction determined by joint 3 angle
    # We need to solve for joint angles 2 and 3 in the plane defined by joint 1
    
    # Distance from origin to target in the XY plane
    r_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust z for the height of the first joint
    z_adj = z
    
    # The problem can be reduced to a 2D inverse kinematics in the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator with link lengths l2 and l3
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths for the 2D problem
    # The effective second link length needs to account for the offset d2
    l2_eff = np.sqrt(l2**2 + d2**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = np.sqrt(r_target**2 + (z_adj - l1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2_eff**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2_eff * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # The angle of joint 3 is measured relative to joint 2
    # For the robot configuration, we need to adjust the sign
    theta3 = -theta3  # Adjust based on the robot's configuration
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # First, find the angle from horizontal to the line from joint 2 to target
    phi = np.arctan2(z_adj - l1, r_target)
    
    # Then find the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    # Using the law of sines
    sin_alpha = l3 * np.sin(abs(theta3)) / d
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arcsin
    sin_alpha = np.clip(sin_alpha, -1.0, 1.0)
    alpha = np.arcsin(sin_alpha)
    
    # Combine to get theta2
    theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the robot's configuration
    # This may need adjustment based on the specific robot
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me reconsider the robot's geometry based on the forward kinematics tests:

```python

    # The position of the wrist (joint 3) needs to be calculated

    y_prime = 0     # In the rotated frame, y is 0 in the plane

    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Joint 3 angle (negative due to the robot's configuration)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me correct the solution:

```python

    """

```

After reviewing the forward kinematics tests more carefully, I need to make one final correction:
