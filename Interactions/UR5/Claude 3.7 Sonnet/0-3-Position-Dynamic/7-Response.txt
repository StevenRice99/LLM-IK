Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 4-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
2. Joints 2, 3, and 4 rotate around Y-axis
3. The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.093, 0] from the last joint

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This simplifies the problem to a planar manipulator in the Y-Z plane
    x_1 = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y_1 = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z_1 = z
    
    # Step 3: Account for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    y_1 = y_1 - tcp_offset
    
    # Step 4: Account for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    y_1 = y_1 - 0.13585
    
    # Step 5: Solve for joints 2, 3, and 4 using the planar manipulator solution
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    d = math.sqrt(y_1**2 + z_1**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the desired elbow configuration
    # We choose the elbow-up configuration
    theta3 = -theta3
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    alpha = math.atan2(z_1, y_1)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate joint 4 to keep the end effector horizontal
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This solution follows these steps:
1. Calculate joint 1 angle using atan2 to point the arm toward the target in the XY plane
2. Transform the target coordinates to the frame after joint 1 rotation
3. Account for the TCP offset and the offset of joint 2 from the base
4. Use the law of cosines to solve for joint 3
5. Calculate joint 2 using the geometric approach
6. Calculate joint 4 to maintain the end effector orientation

The solution handles the 4-DOF manipulator by first solving for the base rotation (joint 1), then treating the remaining joints as a planar manipulator in the resulting plane.
