Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better solution.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that joint 4 is consistently set to 0 in all the successful cases. This suggests that the robot is being controlled with only 3 active joints, with joint 4 kept at a fixed position.

Let me revise my approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 4
    # Since joint 4 is always 0 in the correct solutions, we need to adjust the target position
    # to account for this offset
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction in the local frame,
    # we need to adjust based on the rotation of joint 1
    x_adj = x - 0.093 * math.sin(theta1)
    y_adj = y - 0.093 * math.cos(theta1)
    z_adj = z
    
    # Transform to the frame after joint 1
    # This gives us the position relative to joint 2
    x_2 = x_adj * math.cos(theta1) + y_adj * math.sin(theta1) - 0.13585
    y_2 = -x_adj * math.sin(theta1) + y_adj * math.cos(theta1)
    z_2 = z_adj
    
    # Now we have a planar problem in the X-Z plane of the new frame
    # We need to find joint angles 2 and 3 to reach the point (x_2, z_2)
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    d = math.sqrt(x_2**2 + z_2**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the desired elbow configuration
    # We need to check which configuration matches the correct solutions
    if z_2 < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    alpha = math.atan2(z_2, x_2)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Set joint 4 to 0 as observed in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I see some issues with my approach. Let me reconsider the problem:

1. The robot has 4 joints, but the correct solutions always have joint 4 set to 0.
2. The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, while joints 2, 3, and 4 rotate around the Y-axis.

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Account for the TCP offset [0, 0.093, 0]
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction in the local frame of joint 4,
    # and joint 4 is always 0, we need to adjust the target position
    x_adj = x - 0.093 * s1
    y_adj = y - 0.093 * c1
    z_adj = z
    
    # Transform to the frame of joint 2
    x_2 = x_adj * c1 + y_adj * s1
    y_2 = -x_adj * s1 + y_adj * c1 - 0.13585
    z_2 = z_adj
    
    # Now we have a planar problem in the Y-Z plane of the new frame
    # We need to find joint angles 2 and 3 to reach the point (y_2, z_2)
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    d = math.sqrt(y_2**2 + z_2**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the desired elbow configuration
    # Looking at the correct solutions, we need to determine the appropriate sign
    # This may depend on the quadrant of the target point
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    alpha = math.atan2(z_2, y_2)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Set joint 4 to 0 as observed in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not confident about the sign of theta3. Let me revise one more time based on the examples provided:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Account for the TCP offset [0, 0.093, 0]
    x_adj = x - 0.093 * s1
    y_adj = y - 0.093 * c1
    z_adj = z
    
    # Transform to the frame of joint 2
    x_2 = x_adj * c1 + y_adj * s1
    y_2 = -x_adj * s1 + y_adj * c1 - 0.13585
    z_2 = z_adj
    
    # Now we have a planar problem in the Y-Z plane of the new frame
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    d = math.sqrt(y_2**2 + z_2**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Based on the examples, we need to determine the appropriate sign for theta3
    # Analyzing the correct solutions, it appears theta3 can be either positive or negative
    # Let's try to infer the pattern from the examples
    
    # Looking at the examples, it seems theta3 is determined by the position of the target
    # relative to the robot base
    if z_2 >= 0:
        theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Elbow down configuration
    else:
        theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)   # Elbow up configuration
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    alpha = math.atan2(z_2, y_2)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Set joint 4 to 0 as observed in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After analyzing the examples more carefully, I believe this solution should work better. The key insights are:
1. Joint 4 is always set to 0
2. The sign of theta3 depends on the position of the target relative to the robot base
3. Proper handling of the TCP offset is crucial
