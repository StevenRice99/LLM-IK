Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the solution step by step.

From the tests, I can see that:
1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis (base rotation)
2. Joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate around the Y-axis (they're all in the same plane after the base rotation)
3. The robot is a planar manipulator in the XZ plane after the base rotation

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    # This is the angle in the XY plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us the distance in the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4
    x_prime = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    y_prime = z
    
    # Account for the TCP offset
    x_prime -= 0.093 * np.cos(theta1)
    y_prime -= 0.093 * np.sin(theta1)
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Adjust for the offset in y-direction for joint 2
    y_prime -= l1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    r = np.sqrt(x_prime**2 + y_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(y_prime, x_prime)
    gamma = np.arccos((l2**2 + r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * r))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle to keep the end effector horizontal
    # (or in the desired orientation)
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to review this solution. There's an issue with how I'm handling the TCP offset and the planar kinematics.

Let me correct the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us the distance in the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Account for the TCP offset (0.093 in y-direction of the TCP frame)
    # After joint 1 rotation, this offset is in the r_xy direction
    r_xy -= 0.093
    
    # The target position in the YZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    x_planar = r_xy
    y_planar = z
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2 in Z direction
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Adjust for the offset in y-direction for joint 2
    y_planar -= l1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    r = np.sqrt(x_planar**2 + y_planar**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    # Joint 3 rotates around Y, so the angle is negative
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(y_planar, x_planar)
    gamma = np.arccos((l2**2 + r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * r))
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y, so the angle is positive
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle to keep the end effector horizontal
    # Since all joints rotate around Y, we need to ensure the sum equals zero
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to make one more correction. Looking at the forward kinematics tests, I see that the TCP offset is actually in the local Y direction of the last link. Let me finalize the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This gives us the distance in the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The target position in the XZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    x_planar = r_xy
    y_planar = z
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2 in Z direction
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # TCP offset in local Y direction
    
    # We need to account for the TCP offset, which depends on the orientation of the end effector
    # For now, let's solve without the TCP offset, then adjust
    
    # Adjust for the offset in y-direction for joint 2
    y_planar -= l1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center (not the TCP)
    # The wrist center is the position of joint 4
    r = np.sqrt(x_planar**2 + y_planar**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(y_planar, x_planar)
    gamma = np.arccos((l2**2 + r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * r))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle to keep the end effector horizontal
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Let me review this solution once more. I need to account for the TCP offset correctly:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The TCP offset is 0.093 in the local Y direction of the end effector
    # We need to find the wrist center by moving back from the TCP
    # For a horizontal end effector, this means subtracting the offset from r_xy
    
    # First, let's solve for a horizontal end effector
    # The wrist center coordinates in the XZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    x_wrist = r_xy - 0.093
    y_wrist = z
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2 in Z direction
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    
    # Adjust for the offset in y-direction for joint 2
    y_wrist -= l1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    r = np.sqrt(x_wrist**2 + y_wrist**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)

    # Calculate joint 4 angle to keep the end effector horizontal
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After careful analysis of the forward kinematics tests, I need to make one final correction:

    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # Project the point onto the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    x_proj = x * np.cos(theta1) + y * np.sin(theta1)
    y_proj = z
    
    # Account for the TCP offset (0.093 in local Y direction)
    # Since we want the TCP at the target, we need to find the position of joint 4
    # For a horizontal end effector, the TCP offset is in the X direction of the projection
    x_wrist = x_proj - 0.093
    y_wrist = y_proj
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
