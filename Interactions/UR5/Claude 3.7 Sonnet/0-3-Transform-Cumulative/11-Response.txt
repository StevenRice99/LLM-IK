Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of this 4-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate around the Y-axis
3. The TCP has an offset in the Y direction

Here's my solution for the inverse kinematics function:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
