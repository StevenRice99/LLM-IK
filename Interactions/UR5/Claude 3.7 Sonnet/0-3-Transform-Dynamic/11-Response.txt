I see that my approach still has significant issues. Let me analyze the failures more carefully and develop a correct solution.

Looking at the correct joint values provided in the feedback, I notice that:

1. Joint 1 (theta1) should be equal to rz (the Z-axis rotation in the orientation)
2. The relationship between the other joints and the target position/orientation is more complex than I initially thought

Let me create a completely revised solution:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
