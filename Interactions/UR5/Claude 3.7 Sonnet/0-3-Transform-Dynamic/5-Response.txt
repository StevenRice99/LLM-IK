Based on the forward kinematics results and the robot description, I'll now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF manipulator.

Let me analyze the robot structure:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
- Joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate around Y-axis
- The TCP has an offset in the Y direction

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.093, 0] in its local frame
    # We need to transform this offset based on the desired orientation
    
    # Create rotation matrix from the desired orientation
    # For this robot, the orientation is primarily determined by joint 4
    # and the rotation is around Y-axis for the end effector
    
    # Since the TCP offset is only in Y direction, and all orientation joints rotate around Y,
    # we need to account for the Z rotation from joint 1
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z)
    # This is similar to EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Adjust the target position by removing the TCP offset rotated by theta1
    tcp_offset = [0, 0.093, 0]
    # Rotate the TCP offset by theta1 (around Z)
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    rotated_offset = [-tcp_offset[1] * s1, tcp_offset[1] * c1, tcp_offset[2]]
    
    # Subtract the rotated offset from the target position
    adjusted_x = x - rotated_offset[0]
    adjusted_y = y - rotated_offset[1]
    adjusted_z = z - rotated_offset[2]
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2, 3, and 4
    # We'll use the approach from EXISTING 3, but adapted for our full chain
    
    # Transform the adjusted position to the frame after joint 1
    x_1 = -adjusted_x * s1 + adjusted_y * c1
    y_1 = 0.13585  # Offset to joint 2
    z_1 = adjusted_z
    
    # The remaining problem is to solve a 3-link planar manipulator in the YZ plane
    # with link lengths: 0.425 (joint 2 to 3), 0.39225 (joint 3 to 4)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 in the YZ plane
    L2 = 0.425  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 3 to joint 4
    
    # Adjust for the offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    y_2 = x_1 - 0.13585
    z_2 = z_1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    D = math.sqrt(y_2**2 + z_2**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Negative because of the robot configuration
    
    # Find the angle for joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(z_2, y_2)
    alpha = math.acos((L2**2 + D**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * D))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    # Finally, calculate joint 4 to achieve the desired orientation
    # The orientation is primarily determined by ry (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to account for the contributions of theta2 and theta3
    theta4 = ry - theta2 - theta3
    
    # Normalize all angles to be within [-2π, 2π]
    for theta in [theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4]:
        while theta > 2 * math.pi:
            theta -= 2 * math.pi
        while theta < -2 * math.pi:
            theta += 2 * math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me correct a few issues:

```python

    import math
    
    x, y, z = p

    # Adjust the target position by removing the TCP offset rotated by theta1
    tcp_offset_y = 0.093
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Subtract the rotated offset from the target position
    adjusted_x = x + tcp_offset_y * s1

    # Finally, calculate joint 4 to achieve the desired orientation
    theta4 = ry - theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to revise this solution again. Let me think more carefully about the robot's kinematics:
