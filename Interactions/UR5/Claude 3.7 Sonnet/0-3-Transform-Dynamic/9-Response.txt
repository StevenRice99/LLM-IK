I see the issues with my solution. Let me analyze the failures and develop a correct inverse kinematics solution. The main problems appear to be:

1. Incorrect handling of the TCP offset
2. Issues with the coordinate transformations
3. Problems with the joint angle calculations

Let me create a completely revised solution:

```python

    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.093, 0] in the local frame of the last joint
    
    # Create rotation matrices for the orientation

    # Position of wrist in frame 1

Let me refine this solution further to address the specific issues:
