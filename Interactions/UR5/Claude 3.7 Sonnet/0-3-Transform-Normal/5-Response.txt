I'll solve the inverse kinematics for this 4-DOF serial manipulator step by step. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the closed-form solution.

Based on the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see that:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate around the Y-axis
- The robot has a specific link structure with given offsets

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    l4 = 0.093    # TCP offset
    
    # Step 1: Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z)
    # This determines the plane in which the arm operates
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target point to the plane of the arm
    # We need to work in the plane defined by joint 1
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the TCP offset
    r_xy_adjusted = r_xy - l4 * np.cos(r[1])  # Adjusting for TCP offset and orientation
    z_adjusted = z - l4 * np.sin(r[1])        # Adjusting Z for TCP offset and orientation
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the position of the wrist center
    # This is the point where joint 4 is located
    wrist_x = r_xy_adjusted
    wrist_z = z_adjusted
    
    # Step 4: Solve for joints 2, 3, and 4 using geometric approach
    # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    d = np.sqrt((wrist_x)**2 + (wrist_z - l1)**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find joint angles
    cos_alpha = ((l2**2) + (d**2) - (l3**2)) / (2 * l2 * d)
    cos_alpha = np.clip(cos_alpha, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Angle from horizontal to the line connecting joint 2 to wrist
    beta = np.arctan2(wrist_z - l1, wrist_x)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle using law of cosines
    cos_gamma = ((l2**2) + (l3**2) - (d**2)) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_gamma = np.clip(cos_gamma, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    gamma = np.arccos(cos_gamma)
    
    # Joint 3 is relative to joint 2
    theta3 = np.pi - gamma
    
    # Step 5: Calculate joint 4 to achieve the desired orientation
    # The sum of all joint angles must equal the desired orientation around Y
    # Since joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate around Y, their sum determines the end effector orientation
    theta4 = r[1] - theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates joint 1 (base rotation) using arctan2 of the target x,y coordinates
2. Transforms the target to the plane defined by joint 1
3. Adjusts for the TCP offset based on the desired orientation
4. Uses geometric approach (law of cosines) to solve for joints 2 and 3
5. Calculates joint 4 to achieve the desired orientation

The solution handles the kinematic chain properly, accounting for all link lengths and offsets. It provides a closed-form analytical solution without using optimization methods.
