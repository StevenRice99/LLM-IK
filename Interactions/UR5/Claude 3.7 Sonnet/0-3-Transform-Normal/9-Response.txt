Based on the feedback and the FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I need to revise my inverse kinematics solution. Let me analyze what went wrong and develop a correct solution.

The key issues in my previous solution:
1. Incorrect handling of the orientation
2. Not properly accounting for the kinematic chain and joint relationships
3. Issues with the geometric approach

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """

    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    l4 = 0.093    # TCP offset
    
    # First, calculate the wrist position by removing the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset is applied in the direction determined by the orientation
    # For this robot, the TCP is offset along the y-axis in the local frame
    
    # Create rotation matrix from the target orientation
    # For this robot, we primarily care about the rotation around z (rz) and y (ry)
    cos_rz, sin_rz = np.cos(rz), np.sin(rz)

    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)

    # For this robot, the y-rotation of the end effector is determined by theta2 + theta3 + theta4
    # We need to solve for theta4 given the desired orientation
    
    # First, determine the desired orientation of the end effector in the plane defined by joint 1
    # This is the y-rotation in the local frame after joint 1 rotation
    
    # The desired y-rotation in the local frame after joint 1
    if np.abs(np.cos(rz)) < 1e-10:  # If rz is close to ±π/2
        local_ry = rx if np.sin(rz) > 0 else -rx
    else:
        local_ry = ry

Wait, I see some issues with my approach. Let me revise it based on the FORWARD_KINEMATICS results:
