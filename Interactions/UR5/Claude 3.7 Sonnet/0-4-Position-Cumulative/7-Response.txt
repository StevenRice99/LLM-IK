I see the issues with my solution. Let me analyze the feedback and correct my approach to the inverse kinematics problem.

The main problems appear to be:
1. Incorrect handling of the robot's geometry and joint configurations
2. Issues with the calculation of joint angles, especially for targets below the base plane
3. Incorrect handling of the redundancy in the 5-DOF system

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
import math

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    j1_to_j2_z = 0.13585      # Z-offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    j2_to_j3_z = 0.425        # Z-distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    j2_to_j3_y = -0.1197      # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    j3_to_j4_z = 0.39225      # Z-distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    j4_to_j5_y = 0.093        # Y-offset from joint 4 to joint 5
    j5_to_tcp_z = 0.09465     # Z-offset from joint 5 to TCP
    
    # Step 1: Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target point to account for the TCP and joint 5 offsets
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP to find the position of joint 4
    
    # First, calculate the position of joint 5 by removing the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset is along the z-axis of the last joint frame
    # We need to determine the direction of this offset in the world frame
    
    # Since we're solving for position only with 5 DOF, we have redundancy
    # We'll use the approach from the correct solutions in the feedback
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center (joint 4) position by removing the offsets
    # of joint 5 and the TCP

    # accounting for the offset of joint 3 from joint 2
    effective_j2_to_j3 = math.sqrt(j2_to_j3_z**2 + j2_to_j3_y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    d = math.sqrt(wrist_r**2 + wrist_height**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - effective_j2_to_j3**2 - j3_to_j4_z**2) / (2 * effective_j2_to_j3 * j3_to_j4_z)

    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the line from joint 2 to the wrist center
    gamma = math.atan2(wrist_height, wrist_r)

    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = gamma - alpha

    # This depends on the specific task requirements
    # Based on the feedback, we need to adjust this calculation
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # Joint 5 (rotation around Z-axis at the end)

    # we can set theta5 to 0 as seen in the feedback

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I see that my approach still has issues. Let me revise it:

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)

After further analysis of the feedback, I need to make additional adjustments:
