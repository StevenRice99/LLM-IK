I see that my solution is still not correctly solving the inverse kinematics problem. After analyzing the correct joint values more carefully, I notice that there's a pattern in how the joint angles relate to each other and the target position.

Let me develop a more accurate solution based on the provided examples:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1_y = 0.13585  # Y offset of joint 2
    L2_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 3
    L2_z = 0.425    # Z offset of joint 3
    L3_z = 0.39225  # Z offset of joint 4
    L4_y = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 5
    L5_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation around Z)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 5 (before accounting for joint 5's rotation)
    # Joint 5 is L5_z below the TCP
    z5 = z - L5_z
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4
    # Joint 4 is L4_y away from joint 5 in the direction perpendicular to the arm
    x4 = x - L4_y * math.sin(theta1)
    y4 = y - L4_y * math.cos(theta1)
    z4 = z5
    
    # Transform to the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4
    r4 = math.sqrt(x4**2 + y4**2)
    
    # Account for the offset of joint 2
    r2 = r4 - L1_y
    
    # Now we have a 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # with link lengths L2 and L3 to reach position (r2, z4)
    L2 = math.sqrt(L2_y**2 + L2_z**2)
    L3 = L3_z
    
    # Calculate the angle of L2 with respect to the horizontal
    alpha2 = math.atan2(L2_z, -L2_y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    d = math.sqrt(r2**2 + z4**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between L2 and L3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate the internal angle between links 2 and 3
    theta3_internal = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the line from joint 2 to joint 4
    phi = math.atan2(z4, r2)
    
    # Based on the correct solutions, we need to determine the configuration
    # Let's try both configurations and choose the one that matches the examples
    
    # Configuration 1: Elbow up
    theta3_up = theta3_internal
    psi_up = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3_up), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3_up))
    theta2_up = phi - psi_up
    theta4_up = -(theta2_up + theta3_up)
    
    # Configuration 2: Elbow down
    theta3_down = -theta3_internal
    psi_down = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3_down), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3_down))
    theta2_down = phi - psi_down
    theta4_down = -(theta2_down + theta3_down)
    
    # Choose the configuration based on the target position
    # Looking at the examples, it seems the choice depends on the z-coordinate
    if z < 0:
        theta2 = theta2_up
        theta3 = theta3_up
        theta4 = theta4_up
    else:
        theta2 = theta2_down
        theta3 = theta3_down
        theta4 = theta4_down
    
    # For joint 5, we can set it to 0 as we're only concerned with position
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

After further analysis, I realize that the choice of configuration is more complex than just based on the z-coordinate. Let me revise my approach:

    # Let's use a heuristic based on the target position

    ee_angle_down = theta2_down + theta3_down + theta4_down
    
    # Choose the configuration that keeps the end effector more horizontal
    if abs(ee_angle_up) < abs(ee_angle_down):
        theta2 = theta2_up
        theta3 = theta3_up
        theta4 = theta4_up
    else:

After further analysis of the correct solutions, I realize that my approach is still not capturing the correct configuration selection. Let me try a different approach:
