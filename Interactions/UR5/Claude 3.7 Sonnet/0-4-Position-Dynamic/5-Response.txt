Based on the forward kinematics results, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 5-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS table and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
- Joints 2, 3, and 4 rotate around Y-axis
- Joint 5 rotates around Z-axis
- The robot has a specific kinematic chain with offsets at each joint

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".

    """
    x, y, z = p

    L5_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation around Z)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the wrist offset (joint 5 and TCP)
    # We need to find the position of joint 4 to solve for joints 2 and 3
    wrist_length = math.sqrt(L4_y**2 + L5_z**2)
    wrist_angle = math.atan2(L5_z, L4_y)

    z4 = z - wrist_length * math.sin(wrist_angle)
    
    # Transform to the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4
    r4 = math.sqrt(x4**2 + y4**2)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    r4_adj = r4 - L1_y
    
    # Now solve for joints 2 and 3 using the law of cosines
    L2 = math.sqrt(L2_y**2 + L2_z**2)
    L3 = L3_z
    
    # Calculate the angle of L2 with respect to the horizontal
    alpha2 = math.atan2(L2_z, -L2_y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    d = math.sqrt(r4_adj**2 + z4**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between L2 and d
    cos_beta = (L2**2 + d**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * d)
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
    
    # Calculate the angle of d with respect to the horizontal
    gamma = math.atan2(z4, r4_adj)

    delta = math.acos(cos_delta)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.pi - delta - alpha2
    
    # For joint 4, we need to ensure the end effector is horizontal
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # For joint 5, we need to ensure the end effector is pointing in the right direction
    theta5 = 0  # In this case, we can set it to 0 as we're only concerned with position
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me refine the solution:
