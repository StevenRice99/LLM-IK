Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct solutions, I notice several key issues with my approach:
1. I didn't properly account for the offsets in the kinematic chain
2. The approach for calculating joint angles needs to be revised
3. I need to handle the wrist configuration correctly

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1_y = 0.13585  # Y offset of joint 2
    L2_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 3
    L2_z = 0.425    # Z offset of joint 3
    L3_z = 0.39225  # Z offset of joint 4
    L4_y = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 5
    L5_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation around Z)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Transform the target point to the YZ plane (after joint 1 rotation)
    # We need to account for the TCP and joint 5 offsets
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP to find the position of joint 4
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset (L5_z)
    # and the offset of joint 5 (L4_y)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 5 (before accounting for joint 5's rotation)
    # Joint 5 is L5_z below the TCP
    x5 = x
    y5 = y
    z5 = z - L5_z
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4
    # Joint 4 is L4_y away from joint 5 in the direction perpendicular to the arm
    x4 = x5 - L4_y * math.sin(theta1)
    y4 = y5 - L4_y * math.cos(theta1)
    z4 = z5
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to joint 4 in the XY plane
    r4 = math.sqrt(x4**2 + y4**2)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # First, account for the offset of joint 2
    r2 = r4 - L1_y
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths and angles of the links
    L2 = math.sqrt(L2_y**2 + L2_z**2)
    L3 = L3_z
    
    # Calculate the angle of L2 with respect to the horizontal
    alpha2 = math.atan2(L2_z, -L2_y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    d = math.sqrt(r2**2 + z4**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between L2 and L3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate the internal angle between links 2 and 3
    theta3_internal = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (the joint angle)
    theta3 = math.pi - theta3_internal
    
    # Calculate the angle of the line from joint 2 to joint 4
    phi = math.atan2(z4, r2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the horizontal and the first link
    psi = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3_internal), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3_internal))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = phi - psi + alpha2
    
    # For joint 4, we need to ensure the end effector is pointing in the right direction
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3 - alpha2)
    
    # For joint 5, we can set it to 0 as we're only concerned with position
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the correct solutions more carefully and revise my solution:
