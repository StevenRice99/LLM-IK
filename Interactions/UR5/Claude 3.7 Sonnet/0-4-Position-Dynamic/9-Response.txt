Thank you for the additional feedback. I see that my solution is still not correctly solving the inverse kinematics problem. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully and develop a more accurate solution.

Looking at the correct solutions and comparing them with my results, I notice that I need to handle the configuration of the arm differently. Let me revise my approach:

```python
import math

    """

    L4_y = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 5
    L5_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation around Z)
    # Using the approach from EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 5 (before accounting for joint 5's rotation)
    # Joint 5 is L5_z below the TCP

    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate the internal angle between links 2 and 3
    theta3_internal = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the desired configuration
    # Looking at the correct solutions, we need to determine this based on the target position
    # For targets with negative z, we use a positive angle
    if z < 0:
        theta3 = theta3_internal
    else:

After further analysis of the correct solutions, I see that my approach for determining the sign of theta3 is still not correct. Let me revise it:
