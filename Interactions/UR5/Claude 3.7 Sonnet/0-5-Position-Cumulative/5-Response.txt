Based on the forward kinematics results, I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 6-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop a complete solution.

Looking at the robot configuration:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
- Joints 2, 3, 4, and 6 rotate around Y-axis
- Joint 5 rotates around Z-axis
- The TCP has an offset and orientation relative to joint 6

I'll develop a complete inverse kinematics solution by building on the existing code snippets:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Account for the TCP offset to find wrist center position
    # TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] with orientation [0, 0, 1.570796325]
    # The wrist center is the position of joint 5, which is offset from the TCP
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP y-offset
    wrist_offset = 0.09465  # Joint 6 z-offset
    
    # Calculate wrist center by moving back from TCP along the approach vector
    # Since TCP has a rotation around Z, the approach vector is along Y
    wc_x = x
    wc_y = y - tcp_offset
    wc_z = z - wrist_offset
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2) - 0.093  # Subtract joint 5 y-offset
    s = wc_z - 0.13585  # Height from base to joint 2
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425    # Joint 2 to joint 3
    L2 = 0.39225  # Joint 3 to joint 4
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    D = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    alpha = math.atan2(s, r)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joints 4, 5, and 6, we need to calculate the orientation
    # Since we're only concerned with position, we can set these to 0
    # In a real application, these would be calculated based on the desired end effector orientation
    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    theta6 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The above approach only considers the position without accounting for orientation. Let me revise the solution to properly handle all 6 joints:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot configuration
    d1 = 0.13585      # Z offset to joint 2
    a2 = 0.425        # Length of link 2
    a3 = 0.39225      # Length of link 3
    d5 = 0.093        # Y offset to joint 5
    d6 = 0.09465      # Z offset to joint 6
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP Y offset
    
    # Calculate wrist center position by accounting for the TCP offset
    # Since we're only concerned with position, we can simplify by assuming
    # the TCP is directly at the end of joint 6 plus the offset
    wc_x = x
    wc_y = y - tcp_offset
    wc_z = z
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_y)
    
    # Transform wrist center to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2) - d5
    s = wc_z - d1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    D = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    alpha = math.atan2(s, r)
    beta = math.atan2(a3 * math.sin(theta3), a2 + a3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For a position-only solution, we can set joints 4, 5, and 6 to 0
    # In a complete solution, these would be calculated based on the desired orientation
    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    theta6 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

I need to refine this solution further. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp = p
    
    # Robot dimensions
    d1 = 0.13585      # Z offset to joint 2

    a3 = 0.39225      # Length of link 3
    d5 = 0.093        # Y offset to joint 5
    d6 = 0.09465      # Z offset to joint 6
    d7 = 0.0823       # TCP Y offset
    
    # Calculate wrist center position by moving back from TCP
    # Since we're only concerned with position, we can simplify
    wc_x = x_tcp
    wc_y = y_tcp - d7
    wc_z = z_tcp - d6
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to wrist center in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2) - d5
    s = wc_z - d1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    D = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Negative because of the robot configuration
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    alpha = math.atan2(s, r)
    beta = math.atan2(a3 * math.sin(abs(theta3)), a2 + a3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For a position-only solution, we can set joints 4, 5, and 6 to 0
    # These would normally be calculated based on the desired orientation
    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    theta6 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

This solution still needs refinement. Let me provide a more complete solution:

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
