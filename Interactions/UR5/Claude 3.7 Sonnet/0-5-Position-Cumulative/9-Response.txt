I see the issues with my previous solutions. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values provided in the feedback, I notice that:
1. Joint 5 values vary significantly between examples
2. Joint 4 values also vary widely
3. The relationship between joints is more complex than I initially thought

Let me develop a more comprehensive solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the URDF
    d1 = 0.13585      # Z offset to joint 2
    a2 = 0.425        # Length of link 2
    a3 = 0.39225      # Length of link 3
    d5 = 0.093        # Y offset to joint 5
    d6 = 0.09465      # Z offset to joint 6
    d7 = 0.0823       # TCP Y offset
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position
    # We need to account for the TCP offset and joint 6 offset
    wc_x = x
    wc_y = y - d7
    wc_z = z - d6
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_y)
    
    # Transform the wrist center to the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2) - d5
    s = wc_z - d1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    D = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Negative to match robot configuration
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    alpha = math.atan2(s, r)
    beta = math.atan2(a3 * math.sin(abs(theta3)), a2 + a3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joints 4, 5, and 6, we need to consider the orientation
    # Based on the feedback examples, we'll use a more sophisticated approach
    
    # Joint 4 angle - this affects the pitch of the end effector
    # Looking at the feedback, joint 4 often compensates for joints 2 and 3
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    # Joint 5 angle - this affects the yaw of the end effector
    # Based on the feedback examples, we'll use a more sophisticated heuristic
    if z < 0:
        # For targets below the base plane
        theta5 = -math.pi/2 if x > 0 else math.pi/2
    else:
        # For targets above the base plane
        theta5 = math.pi/2 if y < 0 else -math.pi/2
    
    # Joint 6 angle - this controls the roll of the end effector
    # Based on the feedback, this is consistently set to 0
    theta6 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

After further analysis of the feedback, I see that my approach still needs refinement. Let me provide a more accurate solution:
