Thank you for the additional feedback. I see that my solution is still not accurate enough. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully and develop a more precise solution.

After analyzing the correct solutions, I notice that:
1. Joint 5 values vary significantly and don't follow a simple pattern
2. The relationship between joints 2, 3, and 4 is more complex than I initially thought
3. I need to better account for the robot's geometry

Let me develop a more accurate solution:
