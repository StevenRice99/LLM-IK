Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 6-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the complete solution.

Looking at the robot configuration:
- Joint 1 rotates around Z-axis
- Joints 2, 3, 4, and 6 rotate around Y-axis
- Joint 5 rotates around Z-axis
- The TCP has an offset and orientation relative to the last joint

I'll now complete the inverse kinematics function by combining and extending the existing solutions:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 6
    tcp_offset_y = 0.0823
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 6 (before the TCP offset)
    # The TCP is rotated 1.57 radians around the x-axis relative to joint 6
    # This means the TCP offset is primarily in the y direction when joint 6 is at 0
    
    # Calculate position of joint 6
    x_j6 = x
    y_j6 = y - tcp_offset_y
    z_j6 = z
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x_j6, y_j6)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 5 by removing the offset of joint 6
    j6_length = 0.09465
    x_j5 = x_j6
    y_j5 = y_j6
    z_j5 = z_j6 - j6_length
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 by removing the offset of joint 5
    j5_offset_y = 0.093
    x_j4 = x_j5
    y_j4 = y_j5 - j5_offset_y
    z_j4 = z_j5
    
    # Now we can solve for joints 2, 3, and 4 using the position of joint 4
    # Transform the coordinates to the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4
    x_transformed = x_j4 * math.cos(theta1) - y_j4 * math.sin(theta1)
    y_transformed = x_j4 * math.sin(theta1) + y_j4 * math.cos(theta1)
    z_transformed = z_j4
    
    # Offset from base to joint 2
    j2_offset_y = 0.13585
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_transformed = y_transformed - j2_offset_y
    
    # Now solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-link planar manipulator (joints 2, 3, 4)
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2 to 3
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 to 4
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    d = math.sqrt(y_transformed**2 + z_transformed**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the desired configuration
    # We want the elbow to be pointing upward
    if y_transformed < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the position of joint 4
    alpha = math.atan2(z_transformed, y_transformed)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Joint 4 compensates for the orientation
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # For joints 5 and 6, we'll set them to 0 as we're only solving for position
    # In a real application, these would be determined by the desired orientation
    theta5 = 0
    theta6 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider the solution. The existing code snippets provide valuable insights, but I need to ensure my solution correctly handles the full 6-DOF robot.

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:

    # Calculate position of joint 6
    x_j6 = x
    y_j6 = y - tcp_offset_y

    j2_offset_y = 0.13585

    j6_length = 0.09465
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2
    y_transformed = y_transformed - j2_offset_y
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 5 (removing joint 6 and TCP)
    y_j5 = y_transformed - j5_offset_y
    z_j5 = z_transformed - j6_length

    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the desired configuration
    cross_product = y_j5 * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)) - z_j5 * (L2 * math.sin(theta3))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3

    theta5 = 0
    theta6 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me think more carefully about the kinematic chain and the transformations involved.

The final solution is:
