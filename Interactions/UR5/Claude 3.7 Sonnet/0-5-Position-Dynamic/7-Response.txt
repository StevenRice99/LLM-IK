Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct solutions, I notice:
1. All 6 joints are being used to reach the targets
2. My approach of setting joints 5 and 6 to 0 is incorrect
3. The wrist center calculation needs to be revised

Let me develop a complete solution:

Wait, I need to revise this solution. Let me analyze the problem more carefully.

After analyzing the correct solutions and the robot structure, I'll develop a more accurate solution:
