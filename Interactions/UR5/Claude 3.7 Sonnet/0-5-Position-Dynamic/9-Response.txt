Thank you for the additional feedback. I see that my solution still has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully and develop a more accurate solution.

Looking at the correct solutions, I notice:
1. Joint 5 values vary significantly and don't follow a simple pattern
2. My approach to calculating the wrist center and joint angles needs revision
3. The transformation between coordinate frames needs to be more precise

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python

    cos_angle = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_angle = max(min(cos_angle, 1.0), -1.0)
    link_angle = math.acos(cos_angle)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)

    # For joints 5 and 6, we need to consider the orientation
    # Based on the provided correct solutions, joint 5 varies significantly
    # Let's calculate a value for joint 5 based on the target position

After further analysis, I realize I need to completely revise my approach. Let me develop a solution that more closely matches the correct joint values:
