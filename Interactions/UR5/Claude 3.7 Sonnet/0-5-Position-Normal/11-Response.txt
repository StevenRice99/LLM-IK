I'll analyze the robot structure more carefully based on the forward kinematics results and the feedback from previous attempts. Let me develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the table
    d2 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    d3 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    a3 = 0.425  # Length of link 3
    a4 = 0.39225  # Length of link 4
    d5 = 0.093  # Offset from joint 4 to joint 5
    d6 = 0.09465  # Offset from joint 5 to joint 6
    d7 = 0.0823  # TCP offset in y direction
    
    # From the forward kinematics, we can see that when all joints are at 0:
    # - The TCP is at [0, 0.19145, 0.9119]
    # - The TCP has an orientation of [0, 0, 1.5707963249999999]
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position by accounting for the TCP offset
    # The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.0823, 0] in the local frame of the last link
    # Due to the orientation [0, 0, 1.5707963249999999], this offset is rotated
    
    # When all joints are at 0, the TCP is offset from the wrist by [0, 0.0823, 0]
    # This offset is rotated by theta1 in the world frame
    wc_x = x - d7 * np.cos(theta1)
    wc_y = y - d7 * np.sin(theta1)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Distance from the base to the wrist center in the XY plane
    r = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2)
    
    # Calculate the vertical distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    h = wc_z - d2
    
    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    # We need to account for the offset d3
    s = np.sqrt(r**2 + (h - d3)**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if s > (a3 + a4) or s < abs(a3 - a4):
        # If not reachable, return a default configuration
        # This is to avoid NaN values
        return (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the horizontal and the line from joint 2 to the wrist center
    alpha = np.arctan2(h - d3, r)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle of the elbow (theta3)
    cos_theta3 = (s**2 - a3**2 - a4**2) / (2 * a3 * a4)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Based on the examples, we need to choose the elbow down configuration
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_beta = (a3**2 + s**2 - a4**2) / (2 * a3 * s)
    cos_beta = np.clip(cos_beta, -1.0, 1.0)
    beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
    
    # Theta2 is the difference between alpha and beta for the elbow down configuration
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joints 4, 5, and 6, we need to analyze the examples more carefully
    
    # Joint 4 compensates for the arm angles
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    # Joint 5 (wrist rotation around Z)
    # Based on the examples, theta5 seems to be related to theta1
    theta5 = -theta1
    
    # Joint 6 (final wrist rotation around Y)
    theta6 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

After analyzing the feedback and the forward kinematics results, I see that my approach still has issues. Let me revise it one more time:
