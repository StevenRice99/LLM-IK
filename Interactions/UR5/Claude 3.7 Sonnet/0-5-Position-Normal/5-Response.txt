I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 6-DOF robot manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

Based on the forward kinematics results and the robot description, I can see that:
- The robot has 6 revolute joints with specific axes of rotation (Z, Y, Y, Y, Z, Y)
- The TCP (Tool Center Point) position is what we need to solve for
- We need to find the joint angles that will position the TCP at a given target position

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the table
    d1 = 0  # Base height
    a1 = 0
    d2 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    a2 = 0
    d3 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    a3 = 0.425  # Length of link 3
    d4 = 0
    a4 = 0.39225  # Length of link 4
    d5 = 0.093  # Offset from joint 4 to joint 5
    a5 = 0
    d6 = 0.09465  # Offset from joint 5 to joint 6
    a6 = 0
    d7 = 0  # TCP offset in z
    a7 = 0.0823  # TCP offset in y
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the wrist position
    # The TCP is offset from the wrist by [0, 0.0823, 0] with orientation [0, 0, 1.570796325]
    # This means the TCP is offset in the y direction of the wrist frame
    
    # Since the last joint (joint 6) rotates around Y, and the TCP has an offset in the local y direction,
    # we need to calculate the wrist position by subtracting the TCP offset transformed to the world frame
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation around Z)
    # The projection of the target point onto the XY plane determines the angle of joint 1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the wrist position by accounting for the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset is in the y direction of the last frame
    # When joint 6 is at 0, this offset is in the direction perpendicular to the arm
    wrist_x = x - a7 * np.cos(theta1)
    wrist_y = y - a7 * np.sin(theta1)
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist in the XY plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist in the plane of the arm
    # Adjust for the offsets in the Z direction
    s = wrist_z - d2 - d3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    D = np.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - a3**2 - a4**2) / (2 * a3 * a4)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)  # Negative because of the robot configuration
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and arctangent
    beta = np.arctan2(s, r)
    gamma = np.arccos((a3**2 + D**2 - a4**2) / (2 * a3 * D))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # For a position-only solution, we can set the wrist angles to maintain the end effector orientation
    # For this simple case, we'll set them to keep the TCP pointing forward
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)  # This compensates for the arm angles to keep the wrist level
    theta5 = 0  # No rotation around the Z axis of the wrist
    theta6 = 0  # No additional rotation around the Y axis
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates joint 1 angle based on the target position's projection on the XY plane
2. Accounts for the TCP offset to find the wrist position
3. Uses the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
4. Calculates joint 2 angle using the law of sines and arctangent
5. Sets the wrist angles (joints 4, 5, 6) to maintain a forward-pointing orientation

Note that this is a position-only solution and doesn't account for specific end-effector orientation requirements. For a full position and orientation solution, we would need to use the full rotation matrix approach.
