I see the issues with my previous solution. Let me develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution by analyzing the robot structure more carefully and addressing the problems in my approach.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function with a more robust solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the table
    # Link offsets and lengths
    d1 = 0  # Base height
    d2 = 0.13585  # Offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    d3 = -0.1197  # Offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    a3 = 0.425  # Length of link 3
    a4 = 0.39225  # Length of link 4
    d5 = 0.093  # Offset from joint 4 to joint 5
    d6 = 0.09465  # Offset from joint 5 to joint 6
    d7 = 0.0823  # TCP offset in y (after rotation becomes z in world frame)
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the wrist center
    # The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.0823, 0] with orientation [0, 0, 1.570796325]
    # This means when the end effector is in its default orientation, the TCP is offset in the y direction
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position by subtracting the TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction of the last frame, and the last frame has a rotation around Y,
    # we need to consider how this offset transforms to the world frame
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    r_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Adjust the target position to find the wrist center
    # The TCP is offset by d7 in the y direction of the last frame
    # When all joints are at 0, this offset is in the direction perpendicular to the arm
    wc_x = x - d7 * np.sin(theta1)
    wc_y = y + d7 * np.cos(theta1)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Distance from the base to the wrist center in the XY plane
    r_wc = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2)
    
    # Calculate the height of the wrist center relative to joint 2
    # Joint 2 is at height d2
    wc_height = wc_z - d2
    
    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    # We need to account for the offset d3 in the calculation
    planar_dist = np.sqrt(r_wc**2 + (wc_height - d3)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (planar_dist**2 - a3**2 - a4**2) / (2 * a3 * a4)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    # The elbow can be up or down, we choose the elbow down configuration
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and arctangent
    # First, find the angle between the horizontal and the line from joint 2 to the wrist center
    alpha = np.arctan2(wc_height - d3, r_wc)
    
    # Then find the angle between the first link and the line from joint 2 to the wrist center
    beta = np.arccos((a3**2 + planar_dist**2 - a4**2) / (2 * a3 * planar_dist))
    
    # Theta2 is the sum of these angles for the elbow down configuration
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joints 4, 5, and 6, we need to consider the orientation of the end effector
    # For a position-only solution, we'll set them to values that maintain the end effector orientation
    
    # Joint 4 compensates for the arm angles to keep the wrist level
    theta4 = -(theta2 + theta3)
    
    # Joint 5 (wrist rotation around Z) can be set based on the desired orientation
    # For this solution, we'll use the angle that points the end effector toward the target
    theta5 = -theta1
    
    # Joint 6 (final wrist rotation around Y) can be set to 0 for this position-only solution
    theta6 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

Wait, I see some issues with my approach. Let me revise it:

```python

```

I'm still not accounting for the TCP offset correctly. Let me revise one more time:

Based on the feedback and examples provided, I need to make further adjustments. Let me analyze the correct joint values from the examples to understand the patterns:
