Thank you for providing the forward kinematics results. This helps me understand the robot's structure better. Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 6-DOF manipulator.

Let me analyze the robot structure based on the provided information:
- The robot has 6 revolute joints
- Joints 1 and 5 rotate around the Z-axis
- Joints 2, 3, 4, and 6 rotate around the Y-axis
- The TCP has an orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.570796325] (π/2 around Z-axis)

I'll now complete the inverse kinematics function by combining the existing solutions and extending them to handle the full 6-DOF chain.

Let me review this solution:

1. I first calculate the wrist position by accounting for the TCP offset.
2. I solve for joint 1 (base rotation) using the wrist position.
3. I transform the wrist position to the joint 1 frame.
4. I calculate joints 2 and 3 using the law of cosines based on the distances between joints.
5. I determine the rotation matrix for the first three joints.
6. I calculate the remaining rotation needed for the wrist joints.
7. I extract the Euler angles for joints 4, 5, and 6, handling the special case of gimbal lock.
8. I normalize all angles to ensure they're within the joint limits.

This solution provides a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 6-DOF manipulator.
