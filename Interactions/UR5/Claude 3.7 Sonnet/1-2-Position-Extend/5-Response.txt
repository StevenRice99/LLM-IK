I'll solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and develop the inverse kinematics solution.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see:
- Both joints rotate around the Y-axis
- Link 1 is at the origin
- Link 2 is positioned at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to Link 1
- The TCP is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to Link 2

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

1) First, I need to understand how the joint angles affect the TCP position:
   - Joint 1 rotates the entire arm around the Y-axis at the base
   - Joint 2 rotates the second link around the Y-axis at the joint between links

2) When both angles are 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
   - This confirms the robot extends along the Z-axis when at zero position

3) When both angles are 0.5, the TCP is at [0.5338, -0.1197, 0.5849]
   - This shows how the angles affect the X and Z coordinates

4) The Y coordinate remains constant at -0.1197 regardless of joint angles (since rotation is around Y-axis)

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2 (Z direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset that remains constant
    
    # Check if the target y-coordinate matches the robot's plane
    if y_target != y_offset:
        # In a real implementation, we might handle this differently
        # For now, we'll proceed with the y_offset value as specified in the instructions
        pass
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    beta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to verify this solution. Let me think about the geometry more carefully:

1) The robot has two links that rotate around the Y-axis
2) When both angles are 0, the robot extends straight up along the Z-axis
3) The TCP is offset in Y by -0.1197 from the XZ plane

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2 (Z direction)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    beta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution should work for the 2-DOF manipulator. It uses the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint, and then calculates the first joint angle to position the end effector at the target location.
