I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and movement.

From the test results, I can see:
1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
2. When joint1 = π/2 (1.5708) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.81725, -0.1197, ~0]
3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = π/2 (1.5708), the TCP is at [0.39225, -0.1197, 0.425]

This confirms that:
- Joint1 rotates around the Y-axis at the base
- Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis at its connection point
- Link1 length is 0.425 (in the Z direction when joint1=0)
- Link2 length is 0.39225 (in the Z direction when joint2=0)
- There's a constant Y offset of -0.1197

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Adjust for the constant y-offset
    y_target = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    # First find the angle to the target point in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Then find the angle in the triangle formed by l1, l2, and r
    psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Joint1 angle is the difference
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # If y_target is not 0, we need to handle it differently
    # But since the robot only moves in the XZ plane with Y fixed at y_offset,
    # we don't need additional calculations for y_target
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The robot has both joints rotating around the Y-axis, which means it can only reach positions in a plane. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Since both joints rotate around Y, the robot can only reach positions
    # where y = y_offset. We'll ignore the y-component and solve for x and z.
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    alpha = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful about the signs and the configuration of the robot. Let me finalize the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # We choose the elbow-up configuration
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    alpha = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
