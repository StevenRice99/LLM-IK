I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and movement.

From the test results, I can see:
1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
2. When joint1 = π/2 (1.5708) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.81725, -0.1197, ~0]
3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = π/2 (1.5708), the TCP is at [0.39225, -0.1197, 0.425]

This confirms that:
- Joint1 rotates around the Y-axis at the base
- Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis at its connection point
- Link1 length is 0.425 in the Z direction
- Link2 length is 0.39225 in the Z direction (when joint2 = 0)
- There's a constant Y offset of -0.1197

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Adjust for the constant y-offset
    y_target = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target onto the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Check if y_target is 0 (special case)
    if abs(y_target) < 1e-10:
        # The target is in the XZ plane
        # Calculate joint1 (angle in the XZ plane)
        joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
        
        # Calculate joint2
        # We need to find the angle that places the end effector at distance r from origin
        # Using law of cosines: r^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(π-joint2)
        # Rearranging: cos(π-joint2) = (l1^2 + l2^2 - r^2) / (2*l1*l2)
        # Since cos(π-joint2) = -cos(joint2)
        cos_joint2 = -(l1**2 + l2**2 - r**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
        # Clamp to valid range for arccos
        cos_joint2 = max(min(cos_joint2, 1.0), -1.0)
        joint2 = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    else:
        # The target has a non-zero y component
        # This is a more complex case requiring 3D analysis
        
        # First, calculate joint1 (rotation in XZ plane)
        joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
        
        # Now we need to find joint2 that gives us the correct y_target
        # The y component is affected by joint2
        # Using the forward kinematics, we know:
        # y = y_offset + l2*sin(joint2)
        # Therefore:
        joint2 = np.arcsin(y_target / l2)
        
        # We need to verify this solution works for the x and z components too
        # If not, we may need to adjust joint1 or use the alternative solution for joint2
        
        # The alternative solution for joint2 (π - arcsin(y_target/l2))
        # may be needed depending on the quadrant
        
        # Calculate expected x and z with current solution
        x_expected = (l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint2)) * np.sin(joint1)
        z_expected = (l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint2)) * np.cos(joint1)
        
        # Check if we need the alternative solution
        if (abs(x - x_expected) > 1e-6 or abs(z - z_expected) > 1e-6):
            # Try the alternative solution for joint2
            joint2 = np.pi - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully.

Based on the test results, I need to revise my understanding of the robot's kinematics. Let me complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Adjust for the constant y-offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target onto the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Y axis at the base)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    # We have a triangle with sides l1, l2, and r
    # Using law of cosines: r^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(π-joint2)
    # Rearranging: cos(joint2) = (l1^2 + l2^2 - r^2) / (2*l1*l2)
    cos_joint2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - r**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Clamp to valid range for arccos
    cos_joint2 = max(min(cos_joint2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    joint2 = -np.arccos(cos_joint2)  # Negative because of the robot's configuration
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully.

Let me provide the correct solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Y axis at the base)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    cos_joint2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Clamp to valid range for arccos
    cos_joint2 = max(min(cos_joint2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    joint2 = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
