I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics tests.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can observe:
1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
2. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.81725, -0.1197, 0.00065]
3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2), the TCP is at [0.39225, -0.1197, 0.42531]

This confirms that:
- Joint1 rotates around the Y-axis at the base
- Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis at its connection point
- The Y-coordinate of the TCP remains constant at -0.1197 regardless of joint angles

Let me derive the forward kinematics equations first:

Link 1 length (l₁) = 0.425 (from base to joint2)
Link 2 length (l₂) = 0.39225 (from joint2 to TCP)
Y-offset = -0.1197 (constant)

For a 2-DOF planar manipulator with rotations around the Y-axis:
- x = l₁·cos(θ₁) + l₂·cos(θ₁+θ₂)
- y = constant = -0.1197
- z = l₁·sin(θ₁) + l₂·sin(θ₁+θ₂)

Now, to solve the inverse kinematics:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target in xz-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Apply law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle (two possible solutions, we choose the elbow-down solution)
    theta2 = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)  # Negative for elbow-down configuration
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(z, x)  # Angle of the target from the base
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution uses the law of cosines to find the angle of joint2, and then calculates joint1 based on the target position and joint2 angle. The solution assumes an elbow-down configuration, which is common in many robotic applications.
