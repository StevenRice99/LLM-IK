I see the issue with my previous solution. The main problem is that I didn't properly account for the orientation of the robot's axes. Looking at the feedback, it appears that I mixed up the x and z coordinates in my solution. Let me correct this and provide a proper inverse kinematics solution.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target in xz-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Apply law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    # Use atan2 to get the correct quadrant
    beta = np.arctan2(z, x)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    # Check if we need to use the other solution (elbow up vs elbow down)
    # This is determined by checking if the target is in the negative z region
    if z < 0 and x > 0:
        # For targets in the fourth quadrant, we might need to adjust
        theta2 = -theta2
        beta = np.arctan2(z, x)
        alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
        theta1 = beta - alpha
        theta1 = ((theta1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I see that my solution still has issues. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully.

Looking at the failed test cases and their correct solutions, I notice that there's a pattern in how the correct joint angles relate to the target positions. Let me revise my approach completely:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target in xz-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Apply law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the target from the base
    phi = np.arctan2(z, x)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Check if we need the other IK solution
    # This is determined by comparing our solution with the expected end position
    test_x = l1 * np.cos(theta1) + l2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    test_z = l1 * np.sin(theta1) + l2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # If our test position is far from the target, try the other solution
    if (abs(test_x - x) > 0.01 or abs(test_z - z) > 0.01):
        theta2 = -theta2
        psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
        theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Let me refine this solution one more time to ensure it's correct:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target in xz-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Apply law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle (two possible solutions)
    theta2_elbow_down = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_elbow_up = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 for both solutions
    phi = np.arctan2(z, x)  # Angle of the target from the base
    
    # Elbow down solution
    psi_down = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2_elbow_down), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2_elbow_down))
    theta1_elbow_down = phi - psi_down
    
    # Elbow up solution
    psi_up = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2_elbow_up), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2_elbow_up))
    theta1_elbow_up = phi - psi_up
    
    # Test both solutions to see which one is correct
    # Elbow down solution
    x_down = l1 * np.cos(theta1_elbow_down) + l2 * np.cos(theta1_elbow_down + theta2_elbow_down)
    z_down = l1 * np.sin(theta1_elbow_down) + l2 * np.sin(theta1_elbow_down + theta2_elbow_down)

    error_up = (x - x_up)**2 + (z - z_up)**2
    
    # Choose the solution with the smallest error
    if error_down <= error_up:
        return (theta1_elbow_down, theta2_elbow_down)
    else:
        return (theta1_elbow_up, theta2_elbow_up)
