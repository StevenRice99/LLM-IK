I see the issues with my solution. The main problems appear to be:

1. Not handling the elbow-up vs. elbow-down configurations correctly
2. Not properly accounting for the sign of joint angles
3. Not considering the full range of possible solutions

Let me revise my inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the inner angles of the triangle formed by l1, l2, and r
    # Using law of cosines
    cos_alpha = (l1**2 + r**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)
    
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + l2**2 - r**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
    
    # Calculate the angle from the z-axis to the target point in the XZ plane
    gamma = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # There are two possible solutions: elbow up and elbow down
    # We need to determine which one to use based on the expected output
    
    # Solution 1: Elbow down
    joint1_sol1 = gamma - alpha
    joint2_sol1 = np.pi - beta
    
    # Solution 2: Elbow up
    joint1_sol2 = gamma + alpha
    joint2_sol2 = beta - np.pi
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    def normalize_angle(angle):
        while angle > np.pi:
            angle -= 2 * np.pi
        while angle < -np.pi:
            angle += 2 * np.pi
        return angle
    
    joint1_sol1 = normalize_angle(joint1_sol1)
    joint2_sol1 = normalize_angle(joint2_sol1)
    joint1_sol2 = normalize_angle(joint1_sol2)
    joint2_sol2 = normalize_angle(joint2_sol2)
    
    # Choose the solution that has joint2 in the correct range
    # Based on the error patterns, it seems we need to select the solution
    # where joint2 has the same sign as in the expected output
    
    # For simplicity, let's use a heuristic: if z is negative, prefer solution 2
    # otherwise prefer solution 1
    if z < 0:
        return (joint1_sol2, joint2_sol2)
    else:
        return (joint1_sol1, joint2_sol1)
```

Wait, this approach still doesn't fully address the issues. Let me revise it further:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the inner angles of the triangle formed by l1, l2, and r
    # Using law of cosines
    cos_alpha = (l1**2 + r**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)
    
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + l2**2 - r**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
    
    # Calculate the angle from the z-axis to the target point in the XZ plane
    gamma = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # There are two possible solutions: elbow up and elbow down
    # Solution 1: Elbow down
    joint1_sol1 = gamma - alpha
    joint2_sol1 = np.pi - beta
    
    # Solution 2: Elbow up
    joint1_sol2 = gamma + alpha
    joint2_sol2 = beta - np.pi
    
    # Based on the error patterns, we need to select the solution that matches
    # the expected output. Looking at the failed cases, it seems we need to
    # consider the orientation of the end effector.
    
    # Let's try a different approach: calculate the end effector position for both
    # solutions and choose the one that's closer to the target
    
    # For solution 1
    x1 = l1 * np.sin(joint1_sol1) + l2 * np.sin(joint1_sol1 + joint2_sol1)
    z1 = l1 * np.cos(joint1_sol1) + l2 * np.cos(joint1_sol1 + joint2_sol1)
    
    # For solution 2
    x2 = l1 * np.sin(joint1_sol2) + l2 * np.sin(joint1_sol2 + joint2_sol2)
    z2 = l1 * np.cos(joint1_sol2) + l2 * np.cos(joint1_sol2 + joint2_sol2)
    
    # Calculate distances to target
    dist1 = np.sqrt((x - x1)**2 + (z - z1)**2)
    dist2 = np.sqrt((x - x2)**2 + (z - z2)**2)
    
    # Choose the solution with the smaller distance
    if dist1 <= dist2:
        return (joint1_sol1, joint2_sol1)
    else:
        return (joint1_sol2, joint2_sol2)
```

After analyzing the failed cases more carefully, I see that my approach is still not capturing the correct solution selection logic. Let me try one more time with a different approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint angles using the geometric approach
    # First, find the angle of the target in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the inner angles of the triangle formed by l1, l2, and r
    # Using law of cosines
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + l2**2 - r**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
    
    cos_alpha = (l1**2 + r**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)
    
    # There are two possible configurations: elbow up and elbow down
    # For elbow down configuration
    theta1_down = phi - alpha
    theta2_down = np.pi - beta
    
    # For elbow up configuration
    theta1_up = phi + alpha
    theta2_up = beta - np.pi
    
    # Choose the configuration based on the sign of z
    # If z is negative, we're reaching behind the robot, likely using elbow up
    # If z is positive, we're reaching in front, likely using elbow down
    if z < 0:
        # For targets behind the robot (negative z)
        if x >= 0:
            # First quadrant (behind, right)
            return (theta1_up, theta2_up)
        else:
            # Second quadrant (behind, left)
            return (theta1_up, theta2_up)
    else:
        # For targets in front of the robot (positive z)
        if x >= 0:
            # Fourth quadrant (front, right)
            return (theta1_down, theta2_down)
        else:
            # Third quadrant (front, left)
            return (theta1_down, theta2_down)
```

After further analysis of the failed cases, I see that my approach is still not capturing the correct solution selection logic. Let me provide a more robust solution:
