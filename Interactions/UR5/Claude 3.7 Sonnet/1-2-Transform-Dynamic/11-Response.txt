I see the pattern in the failures now. The main issue is that I'm not correctly handling the relationship between the orientation and the joint angles, particularly when rx and rz are close to π. Let me revise my solution with a more comprehensive approach:

```python

            return (theta1_pos, theta2_pos)
        else:
            return (theta1_neg, theta2_neg)

After analyzing the failed test cases more carefully, I see that I need to handle the orientation differently. Let me create a more accurate solution:

After further analysis of the failed test cases, I see that I need a more fundamental approach. Let me create a final solution:
