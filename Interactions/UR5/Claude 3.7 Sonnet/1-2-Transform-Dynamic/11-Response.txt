I see the pattern in the failures now. Let me analyze the test cases more carefully:

1. When the orientation has rx and rz close to π, the robot is in a "flipped" configuration
2. The sign of theta2 should be determined by the sign of ry, but with additional logic for the flipped configuration
3. For theta1, I need to consider both the orientation and the quadrant of the target position

Let me create a corrected solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_squared = x**2 + z**2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (r_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate the magnitude of theta2
    theta2_mag = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine if we're in a flipped configuration (rx and rz close to π)
    flipped = (abs(rx - math.pi) < 0.1 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 0.1)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on ry and flipped state
    if (flipped and ry > 0) or (not flipped and ry < 0):
        theta2 = -theta2_mag
    else:
        theta2 = theta2_mag
    
    # Calculate the angle to the target in the XZ plane
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the angle from the first link to the line to the target
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(abs(theta2)), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Adjust psi based on the sign of theta2
    if theta2 < 0:
        psi = -psi
    
    # Calculate theta1 based on the flipped state
    if flipped:
        theta1 = phi - psi + math.pi
    else:
        theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I think I'm still missing something. Let me analyze the test cases more carefully:

1. For the case with position [0.322780066202141, -0.1197, -0.445564299638089] and orientation [3.141592653589793, 1.504113491087436, 3.141592653589793], the correct joint values are [3.303709293282698, -1.66623013078034]
2. For the case with position [-0.44069823175945905, -0.1197, 0.09801814323829801] and orientation [0, -0.30464650406695803, 0], the correct joint values are [-2.278132900884188, 1.9734863968172291]

I notice that the sign of theta2 doesn't always match the sign of ry. Let me try a different approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_squared = x**2 + z**2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (r_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate the magnitude of theta2
    theta2_mag = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine if we're in a flipped configuration (rx and rz close to π)
    flipped = (abs(rx - math.pi) < 0.1 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 0.1)
    
    # Calculate the angle to the target in the XZ plane
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For the flipped configuration, we need to adjust phi
    if flipped:
        phi = phi + math.pi
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the orientation
    if (flipped and ry > 0) or (not flipped and ry < 0):
        theta2 = -theta2_mag
    else:
        theta2 = theta2_mag
    
    # Calculate the angle from the first link to the line to the target
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(abs(theta2)), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    if theta2 < 0:
        psi = -psi
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a more direct approach by analyzing the specific patterns in the test cases:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_squared = x**2 + z**2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (r_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate the magnitude of theta2
    theta2_mag = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine if we're in a flipped configuration (rx and rz close to π)
    flipped = (abs(rx - math.pi) < 0.1 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 0.1)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2
    if flipped:
        # In flipped configuration, use opposite sign of ry
        theta2 = -theta2_mag if ry > 0 else theta2_mag
    else:
        # In normal configuration, use sign of ry
        theta2 = theta2_mag if ry > 0 else -theta2_mag
    
    # Calculate the angle to the target in the XZ plane
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the angle from the first link to the line to the target
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(abs(theta2)), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    if theta2 < 0:
        psi = -psi
    
    # Calculate theta1 based on the flipped state
    if flipped:
        theta1 = phi - psi + math.pi
    else:
        theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After analyzing the test cases more carefully, I believe the issue is with how I'm determining the configuration and the signs of the angles. Let me create a final solution:

```python

    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
