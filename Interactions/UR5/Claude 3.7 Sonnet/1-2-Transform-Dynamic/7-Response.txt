I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics tests.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
1. Both joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The first joint is at the origin
3. The second joint is positioned at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to the first joint
4. The TCP is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the second joint

Let me analyze the forward kinematics results:

1. When both joints are at 0:
   - TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]

2. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0:
   - TCP is at [0.8172497408760417, -0.1197, 0.0006507980043467595]
   - This shows that joint1 rotates the entire arm around the Y-axis

3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2):
   - TCP is at [0.3922498756300121, -0.1197, 0.4253123591522851]
   - This shows that joint2 rotates only the second link around the Y-axis

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the constant y-offset
    y_offset = -0.1197
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r_target = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    # Using atan2 to determine the correct quadrant
    beta = math.atan2(z, x)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # Adjust angles based on the orientation of the robot
    # Since both joints rotate around Y-axis, we need to handle the signs correctly
    if x < 0 and z < 0:
        theta1 = theta1 + math.pi
    
    # The orientation parameter r is not used in this solution as the robot has only 2 DOF
    # and cannot independently control orientation
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

1. When both joints are at 0, the arm is fully extended upward along the Z-axis.
2. When joint1 = π/2, the arm rotates 90 degrees around the Y-axis, pointing along the X-axis.
3. When joint2 = π/2, the second link rotates 90 degrees around the Y-axis relative to the first link.

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust for the constant y-offset
    y_adjusted = y + 0.1197  # The y-offset is -0.1197
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Project the target onto the XZ plane
    r_target = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    # Using atan2 to determine the correct quadrant
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful with the signs and the specific configuration of this robot. Let me complete the final solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Project the target onto the XZ plane (since y is constant at -0.1197)
    r_target = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = phi
    
    # Adjust theta1 based on the configuration
    if z >= 0:
        theta1 = phi - psi
    else:
        theta1 = phi + psi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
