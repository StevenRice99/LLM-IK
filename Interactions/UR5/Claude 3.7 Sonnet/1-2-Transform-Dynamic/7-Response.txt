I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and the forward kinematics results to derive the solution.

From the provided information:
- We have 2 revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis
- The first joint is at the origin [0,0,0]
- The second joint is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to the first joint
- The TCP (end effector) is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the second joint

Let's analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the transformation:

1. When both joints are at 0:
   - TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
   
2. When joint1=0.5, joint2=0.5:
   - TCP is at [0.5338228476976836, -0.1197, 0.5849061682801862]
   
3. When joint1=1.0, joint2=0:
   - TCP is at [0.6876921623342533, -0.1197, 0.44156205947073723]

Now I'll derive the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link (z-direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of the second joint and TCP
    
    # Adjust target position to account for y-offset
    # Since y is constant at -0.1197 for this robot, we need to check if target y matches
    if abs(y - y_offset) > 1e-6:
        raise ValueError(f"Target y-coordinate must be {y_offset} for this robot")
    
    # For a 2-DOF planar manipulator with both joints rotating around Y-axis,
    # we can solve for joint angles in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 relative to the target position
    # We need to find joint1 angle that orients the first link correctly
    
    # First, calculate the angle of joint 1
    # This is the angle in the XZ plane from the Z-axis to the line connecting
    # the origin to the projection of the target point
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Now calculate joint 2 angle
    # We need to find the angle that positions the end effector at the target
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    target_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between the two links
    # c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(C)
    # where c is target_dist, a is l1, b is l2, and C is the supplementary angle to theta2
    
    cos_theta2 = (target_dist**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (negative because of the robot's configuration)
    theta2 = -math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust theta1 to account for the angle of the first link relative to the target
    # Using the law of sines: sin(A)/a = sin(B)/b = sin(C)/c
    beta = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(abs(theta2)), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # If theta2 is negative, we need to subtract beta from theta1
    if theta2 < 0:
        theta1 = theta1 - beta
    else:
        theta1 = theta1 + beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me correct it:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link (z-direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of the second joint and TCP
    
    # Adjust target position to account for y-offset
    # Since y is constant at -0.1197 for this robot, we need to check if target y matches
    if abs(y - y_offset) > 1e-6:
        raise ValueError(f"Target y-coordinate must be {y_offset} for this robot")
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    target_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (target_dist**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using atan2
    # First, find the angle to the target
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Then find the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Combine to get theta1
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Actually, I need to make one more correction to account for the orientation of the robot:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link (z-direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of the second joint and TCP
    
    # For this robot, the orientation is determined by the joint angles
    # The y-component of the orientation (ry) is the sum of joint angles
    # So joint2 = ry - joint1
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    target_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (target_dist**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using atan2
    # First, find the angle to the target
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Then find the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Combine to get theta1
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Check if the orientation matches what we expect
    # For this robot, ry should equal theta1 + theta2
    expected_ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    # If the orientation doesn't match, we need to use the other solution
    # (there are typically two solutions for a 2-DOF arm)
    if abs(expected_ry - ry) > 1e-6:
        theta2 = -theta2
        psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
        theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After further analysis of the forward kinematics results, I need to make a final correction:

```python

    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Check if the orientation constraint is satisfied
    # If not, we need to use the other solution
    if abs((theta1 + theta2) - ry) > 1e-6:
        theta2 = -theta2
        psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
        theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
