I see the issues with my solution. The main problems appear to be:

1. Not handling the orientation correctly
2. Not considering the full range of possible solutions (elbow up vs. elbow down configurations)
3. Not properly handling the quadrant for the angles

Let me revise the solution:

Wait, I need to revise this solution again. Looking at the failed test cases, I see that the orientation handling is more complex than I initially thought. Let me create a more robust solution:

```

After analyzing the failed test cases more carefully, I see that I need a more fundamental approach. Let me create a final solution:

    # Since both joints rotate around Y-axis, theta1 + theta2 = ry (when rx=0, rz=0)
    # or theta1 + theta2 = ry - π (when rx=π, rz=π)

After further analysis of the failed test cases, I need to make one more revision to handle the orientation correctly:
