I see the pattern now. Looking at the feedback, I notice that my solution is correctly calculating theta1 in most cases, but I'm not handling theta2 correctly. The issue appears to be that I need to consider how the target orientation relates to the joint angles in a more complex way.

Let me analyze the examples more carefully:

1. For the first example:
   - Correct values: [1.046648358028791, -1.412498797029264]
   - My code produced: [1.0466483580287917, -0.36585043900047287]
   - The theta1 is correct, but theta2 is wrong

2. For the second example:
   - Correct values: [3.303709293282698, -1.66623013078034]
   - My code produced: [0.16211663969290546, 1.6374791625023573]
   - Both values are incorrect

Looking at the pattern across all examples, I see that I need to consider:
1. The relationship between the target orientation and joint2
2. How the configuration (flipped or not) affects both joints
3. The relationship between joint1 and the wrist position

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    import math
    import numpy as np

    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Determine if we're in the "flipped" configuration
    flipped = abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 1e-6

    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # The sign depends on the configuration
    if flipped:
        theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    else:
        theta2 = -math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the target orientation
    if flipped:
        # In flipped configuration, adjust theta2 based on ry
        theta2 = math.pi - ry
    else:
        # In normal configuration
        if ry > 0:
            theta2 = -math.pi + ry
        else:
            theta2 = ry
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the position of the wrist
    # The wrist position depends on theta2
    x_wrist = x - l2 * math.sin(theta2)
    z_wrist = z - l2 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 to position the wrist
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist)
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I'm still not capturing the pattern correctly. Let me try a different approach by analyzing the examples more systematically:

    """

    # Determine if we're in the "flipped" configuration
    flipped = abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 1e-6
    
    # For the flipped configuration, we need to adjust the target orientation
    if flipped:
        target_theta2 = math.pi - ry
    else:
        target_theta2 = ry
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (end of link1) based on the target position and orientation
    x_wrist = x - l2 * math.sin(target_theta2)
    z_wrist = z - l2 * math.cos(target_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the wrist
    d = math.sqrt(x_wrist**2 + z_wrist**2)
    
    # Check if the wrist position is reachable
    if d > l1:
        # If not reachable, adjust the wrist position to be at the maximum reach
        scale = l1 / d
        x_wrist *= scale
        z_wrist *= scale
    
    # Calculate theta1 to position the wrist
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist)
    
    # The second joint angle is determined by the target orientation
    theta2 = target_theta2

    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After careful analysis of the feedback examples, I see that I'm still missing something. Let me try one more approach:
