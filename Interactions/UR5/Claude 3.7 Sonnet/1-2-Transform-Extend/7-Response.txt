I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the data from the forward kinematics tests to understand the robot's behavior.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can observe:
1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
2. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.81725, -0.1197, 0.00065]
3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2), the TCP is at [0.39225, -0.1197, 0.42531]

This confirms that:
- Joint1 rotates around the Y-axis at the base
- Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis at its connection point
- The robot has a planar structure that can reach positions in the XZ plane (with constant Y)

Let me now develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset that remains constant
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the y_offset
    # Since y is constant in this robot, we only work with x and z
    
    # Calculate joint angles using geometric approach
    # For a 2-link planar manipulator, we can use the law of cosines
    
    # Calculate the distance from base to target point (in xz plane)
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for joint2 (elbow up/down)
    # We'll choose the elbow down solution
    theta2 = -math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Now find joint1 angle
    beta = math.atan2(z, x)  # Angle of the target point in xz plane
    
    # Calculate alpha using law of sines
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Joint1 angle is the difference between beta and alpha
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis
2. The TCP position depends on both joint angles
3. The orientation r is given as [x, y, z] in radians, which affects the solution

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset that remains constant
    
    # Since both joints rotate around Y-axis, the orientation around Y (ry)
    # is the sum of the joint angles
    
    # First, calculate the position of the wrist (before the last link)
    # We need to account for the orientation to find the wrist position
    wrist_x = x - l2 * math.sin(ry)
    wrist_z = z - l2 * math.cos(ry)
    
    # Now solve for joint1 using the wrist position
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 as the remaining orientation
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful with this solution. Let me reconsider the problem:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around Y-axis,
    # the orientation ry determines the angle of the end effector in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate joint angles
    # For a 2R planar manipulator, we can use geometric approach
    
    # First, calculate the distance from base to target in XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # The orientation ry determines whether we use elbow up or down solution
    # If ry indicates the end effector should point downward, use negative theta2
    if math.sin(ry) < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z) - math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Ensure the final orientation matches the requested ry
    if abs((theta1 + theta2) - ry) > 0.01:
        # If orientation doesn't match, try the other elbow solution
        theta2 = -theta2
        theta1 = math.atan2(x, z) - math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Let me refine this solution one more time to ensure it's correct:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # For this robot, we need to find joint angles that:

    # 2. Orient the end effector to match the target orientation ry
    
    # Since both joints rotate around Y-axis, the end effector orientation ry
    # is directly related to the sum of joint angles: ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    # First, we need to find the position of the wrist (before the last link)
    # based on the desired end effector position and orientation
    wrist_x = x - l2 * math.sin(ry)
    wrist_z = z - l2 * math.cos(ry)
    
    # Calculate the distance from base to wrist
    d = math.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > l1:
        # If wrist position is beyond reach of first link, adjust to closest reachable point
        scale = l1 / d
        wrist_x *= scale
        wrist_z *= scale
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle to reach the wrist position
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle to achieve the desired orientation
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After careful analysis, I believe this solution is still not quite right. Let me provide a more accurate solution:
