I see that I need to develop a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of a 2-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and movement patterns.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can observe:
1. Both joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The first link is at the origin, and the second link is positioned at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
3. The TCP (Tool Center Point) is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the second link

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

First, I'll analyze how the joint angles affect the TCP position:
- When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
- When joint1=0.5 and joint2=0.5, the TCP is at [0.5338, -0.1197, 0.5849]
- When joint1=0.5 and joint2=-0.5, the TCP is at [0.2038, -0.1197, 0.7652]

I notice that:
1. The y-coordinate remains constant at -0.1197 regardless of joint angles
2. The x and z coordinates change based on the joint angles

Now, let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Y offset
    y_offset = -0.1197
    
    # Check if the target y-coordinate matches the robot's y-plane
    if y_target != y_offset:
        raise ValueError("Target y-coordinate must be -0.1197 as the robot can only move in the XZ plane")
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r_target = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (r_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for joint2 (elbow up or elbow down)
    # We'll choose the elbow down configuration
    theta2 = -math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the first joint
    beta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The robot's structure is more complex than I initially thought. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link parameters
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    y_offset = -0.1197
    
    # For this robot, the orientation is determined by joint2
    # The target orientation in y (pitch) corresponds to joint2
    theta2 = r[1]  # The y component of the orientation
    
    # Compute the position of joint2 using forward kinematics with theta1 unknown
    # and theta2 known
    x_j2 = l1 * math.sin(theta1)
    z_j2 = l1 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # The TCP position is determined by both joints
    # We need to solve for theta1 such that the TCP reaches the target
    
    # This is a complex problem that requires careful consideration of the robot's geometry
    # Let me revise my approach...
```

I need to be more careful with the geometry. Let me complete the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    # Target position
    x = p[0]
    y = p[1]
    z = p[2]
    
    # Target orientation (only y-rotation matters for this robot)
    y_rot = r[1]
    
    # Link parameters
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Since joint2 directly controls the orientation around y-axis
    theta2 = y_rot
    
    # Calculate the position of the end of link2 (before TCP)
    # This depends on the orientation (theta2)
    x_end = x - l2 * math.sin(theta2)
    z_end = z - l2 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Now calculate theta1 to position the end of link1 at this point
    # Using atan2 to get the correct quadrant
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_end, z_end)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
