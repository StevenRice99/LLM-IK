I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the feedback, I notice that my inverse kinematics function is not correctly handling the orientation and is producing incorrect joint values. Let me revise my approach by carefully analyzing the robot's kinematics and the correct joint values provided in the feedback.

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x = p[0]
    y = p[1]
    z = p[2]
    
    # Target orientation (in radians)
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link parameters
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # For this robot, joint2 directly affects the orientation around y-axis
    # The orientation is either ry or ry ± π depending on the configuration
    
    # First, determine joint2 based on the orientation
    # We need to handle the case where the orientation can be achieved with joint2 or joint2 ± π
    
    # Check if the orientation is close to π or -π
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 1e-6:
        # If rx and rz are ±π, we're in the "flipped" configuration
        theta2 = -ry  # Negate ry for the flipped configuration
    else:
        # Standard configuration
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Now calculate the position of the wrist (end of link1)
    # This depends on the target position and orientation
    
    # The end effector position is related to the wrist position by:
    # p_wrist = p_target - l2 * [sin(theta2), 0, cos(theta2)]
    x_wrist = x - l2 * math.sin(theta2)
    z_wrist = z - l2 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Now calculate theta1 to position the wrist at this point
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist)
    
    # Check if we need to flip theta1 based on the orientation
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 1e-6:
        # If rx and rz are ±π, we're in the "flipped" configuration
        theta1 = theta1 + math.pi
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Looking at the feedback examples more carefully, I see that there's a pattern in how the correct joint values relate to the target position and orientation.

Let me revise my approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    # Target position
    x = p[0]
    y = p[1]
    z = p[2]
    
    # Target orientation
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link parameters
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Determine if we're in the "flipped" configuration
    flipped = abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 1e-6
    
    # Set joint2 based on orientation
    if flipped:
        theta2 = math.pi - ry  # Use π - ry for flipped configuration
    else:
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (end of link1)
    x_wrist = x - l2 * math.sin(theta2)
    z_wrist = z - l2 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate distance from origin to wrist
    dist = math.sqrt(x_wrist**2 + z_wrist**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if dist > l1:
        # If not reachable, set the arm to point as close as possible
        theta1 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist)
    else:
        # Calculate theta1
        theta1 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist)
        
        # If in flipped configuration, adjust theta1
        if flipped:
            theta1 = theta1 + math.pi
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After analyzing the feedback examples more carefully, I see that my approach still isn't capturing the correct relationship. Let me make one final revision:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    # Target position
    x = p[0]
    y = p[1]
    z = p[2]
    
    # Target orientation
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link parameters
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Determine joint2 based on orientation
    # For this robot, joint2 directly controls the y-rotation
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 1e-6:
        # We're in the "flipped" configuration
        theta2 = math.pi - ry
    else:
        theta2 = ry
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (end of link1)
    x_wrist = x - l2 * math.sin(theta2)
    z_wrist = z - l2 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 to position the wrist
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist)
    
    # Adjust theta1 based on the configuration
    if abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 1e-6:
        # In the flipped configuration, we need to adjust theta1
        if theta1 > 0:
            theta1 = theta1 - math.pi
        else:
            theta1 = theta1 + math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
