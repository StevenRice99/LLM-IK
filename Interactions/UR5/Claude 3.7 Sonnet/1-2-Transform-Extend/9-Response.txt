I see the issue with my previous solution. The main problem is that I didn't correctly handle the orientation parameter. Let me analyze the feedback and develop a correct solution.

Looking at the failed test cases, I notice:
1. The orientation parameter r contains Euler angles [rx, ry, rz], and many test cases have rx and rz equal to π (3.14159...)
2. The correct joint values sometimes have large differences from what my solution produced
3. There seems to be a pattern where my solution is not correctly handling the orientation constraints

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me simplify and focus on the core issue:
