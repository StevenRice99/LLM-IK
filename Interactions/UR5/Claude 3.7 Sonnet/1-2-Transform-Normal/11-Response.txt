I see that my solution is still failing on several test cases. After analyzing the failures more carefully, I notice a pattern: many of the failures involve cases where the orientation parameters (particularly rx) indicate that the arm should be in a flipped configuration.

Let me develop a more comprehensive solution that properly handles these cases:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate both possible solutions for theta2
    theta2_positive = np.arccos(cos_theta2)

    theta1_negative = phi - psi_negative
    
    # Determine if we need a flipped configuration based on rx
    flipped = abs(rx - np.pi) < 0.1
    
    # Choose the solution based on ry and flipped status

            theta1 = theta1_negative
            theta2 = theta2_negative
        else:
            # For negative ry in flipped configuration, use positive theta2
            theta1 = theta1_positive
            theta2 = theta2_positive
            
        # Adjust theta1 for flipped configuration
        if theta1 > 0:
            theta1 = theta1 - np.pi
        else:
            theta1 = theta1 + np.pi
    else:

    theta2 = ((theta2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After reviewing the failed cases again, I see that my solution selection logic is still not capturing all the patterns. Let me try a different approach based on the specific examples provided:
