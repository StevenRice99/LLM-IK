I see that my solution is still not correctly handling all the cases. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully and develop a more robust solution.

Looking at the failed cases, I notice that:
1. The orientation parameter is crucial for determining the correct configuration
2. There's a complex relationship between the target position, orientation, and joint angles
3. I need to better understand how the orientation affects the joint configuration

Let me develop a more comprehensive solution:

```python

This approach with hardcoded cases isn't ideal. Let me try a more general solution based on the patterns I'm seeing:
