I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the forward kinematics results I've observed.

Let me analyze the robot structure and the forward kinematics results:

1. The robot has 2 revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis
2. The first joint is at the origin
3. The second joint is positioned at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to the first joint
4. The TCP (Tool Center Point) is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the second joint

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how the joint angles affect the final TCP position:
- When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
- When joint1 = 1.57 (90°) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.8172, -0.1197, 0.0006]
- When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (90°), the TCP is at [0.3922, -0.1197, 0.4253]

Now I'll derive the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link (z-direction when joint1 = 0)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link (z-direction when joint2 = 0)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset that remains constant
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the y-offset
    # Since y is always offset by -0.1197 regardless of joint angles
    y_target = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target in the XZ plane
    r_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + (z**2))
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    # r_target^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(π - joint2)
    # Rearranging: cos(joint2) = (l1^2 + l2^2 - r_target^2) / (2*l1*l2)
    cos_joint2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - r_target**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)
    joint2 = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    # We need to find the angle between the z-axis and the line to the target
    # and adjust it by the angle created by the second link
    
    # First, find the angle from z-axis to the target in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    # Using the law of sines: sin(alpha) / l2 = sin(joint2) / r_target
    sin_joint2 = np.sin(joint2)
    alpha = np.arcsin((l2 * sin_joint2) / r_target) if r_target > 0 else 0
    
    # Joint1 is the angle from z-axis to target, adjusted by alpha
    joint1 = phi - alpha
    
    # Handle the case where the target is directly above the base
    if x == 0 and z == 0:
        joint1 = 0
        joint2 = 0
    
    # Ensure the angles are within the specified limits [-6.28, 6.28]
    joint1 = np.clip(joint1, -6.2831853, 6.2831853)
    joint2 = np.clip(joint2, -6.2831853, 6.2831853)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to revise this solution. There's an issue with my approach. Let me reconsider the geometry:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position

    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset that remains constant
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the y-offset
    # Since y is always offset by -0.1197 regardless of joint angles
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # Since both joints rotate around Y-axis, the y-coordinate remains constant
    # We only need to solve for joint angles in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target in the XZ plane
    r_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    # r_target^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(π - joint2)
    # For a standard 2R manipulator, we have:
    cos_joint2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for joint2 (elbow up/down)
    # We'll choose the elbow-up configuration
    joint2 = -np.arccos(cos_joint2)  # Negative for elbow-up
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    # We use atan2 to find the angle in the XZ plane
    beta = np.arctan2(z, x)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint2))
    
    # Joint1 is the combination of these angles
    joint1 = beta - gamma
    
    # Adjust joint1 by π/2 because the robot's 0 position has the arm pointing up (z-axis)
    joint1 = joint1 - np.pi/2
    
    # Ensure the angles are within the specified limits [-6.28, 6.28]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to revise this solution again. Let me carefully analyze the forward kinematics results:

    # Adjust for the constant y-offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # Since both joints rotate around Y-axis, the y-coordinate remains constant
    # We only need to solve for joint angles in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle

    return (theta1, theta2)
```
