I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the forward kinematics results I've observed.

Let me analyze the robot structure and the forward kinematics results:

1. The robot has 2 revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis
2. The first joint is at the origin
3. The second joint is positioned at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to the first joint
4. The TCP (Tool Center Point) is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the second joint

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how the joint angles affect the final TCP position:
- When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
- When joint1 = 1.57 (90째) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.8172, -0.1197, 0.0006]
- When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (90째), the TCP is at [0.3922, -0.1197, 0.4253]

Now I'll derive the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link (z-direction when joint1 = 0)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link (z-direction when joint2 = 0)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset that remains constant
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the y-offset
    y_target = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the position in the XZ plane (ignoring the y-offset)
    r_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + (z - l1)**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable (not needed as per instructions)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + (z - l1)**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l2 * np.sqrt(x**2 + (z - l1)**2))
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # We need to determine the sign of theta2 based on the desired orientation
    # For this robot, positive theta2 means the second link points upward
    if z < l1:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z - l1)
    
    # Return the joint angles in radians
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725], which is the sum of the z-components (0.425 + 0.39225) plus the origin.

2. When joint1 = 1.57 (90째), the first link rotates around the Y-axis, causing the second joint and TCP to move to the X-axis. The TCP is at [0.8172, -0.1197, 0.0006], which confirms this.

3. When joint2 = 1.57 (90째), the second link rotates to point along the X-axis, resulting in the TCP at [0.3922, -0.1197, 0.4253].

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset that remains constant
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # If y_adjusted is not 0, the target is not reachable with this robot configuration
    # since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, keeping the TCP in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(z, x)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # Adjust angles based on the desired orientation
    # For this robot, we need to consider the quadrant of the target
    if x < 0 and z < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me reconsider the geometry:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset that remains constant
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_squared = x**2 + z**2
    r = np.sqrt(r_squared)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z) - np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution still doesn't fully account for all possible configurations. Let me make one final revision:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry

    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_squared = x**2 + z**2
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r_squared - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta2 (elbow up or elbow down)
    # We'll choose the elbow down configuration
    theta2 = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)  # Negative for elbow down
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    beta = np.arctan2(x, z)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
