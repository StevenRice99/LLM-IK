I see the issues with my inverse kinematics solution. Let me analyze the failures and correct my approach.

The main problems appear to be:

1. I didn't properly handle the multiple possible solutions for a given target position
2. I didn't account for the orientation parameter in my solution
3. There are issues with the quadrant selection for the joint angles

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of second link
    
    # The orientation around Y-axis (ry) determines the configuration of joint2
    # We need to consider this to select the correct solution
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (r_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint2 angle - we need to determine the sign based on the orientation

    if ry > 0:
        theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    else:
        theta2 = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # For some cases, we need to flip the configuration based on the target position
    # If the target is behind the robot (z < 0), we might need to adjust
    if z < 0 and x < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate joint1 angle
    # First, find the angle from the z-axis to the target in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Then calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Joint1 is the combination of these angles
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Adjust based on the target orientation
    # If rx is close to π (180°), we need to flip the arm configuration
    if abs(rx - np.pi) < 0.1:
        theta1 = theta1 + np.pi
        if theta2 > 0:
            theta2 = -theta2 + 2*np.pi
        else:
            theta2 = -theta2 - 2*np.pi

    theta2 = ((theta2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After reviewing the failed cases more carefully, I see that my approach still has issues. Let me revise it again:

After further analysis of the failed cases, I need to make more significant changes to my approach:
