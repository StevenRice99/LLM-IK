I see the issue now. Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I notice that the orientation [π, y, π] requires a specific approach to handle correctly. Let me analyze the patterns in the correct solutions more carefully:

1. When the orientation is [π, y, π], the robot needs to reach the target from a different configuration
2. The relationship between joint angles and orientation is more complex than I initially thought

Let me try a completely different approach based on the feedback:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # Check if we have the special orientation case [π, y, π]
    flipped = (abs(rx - np.pi) < 1e-10) and (abs(rz - np.pi) < 1e-10)
    
    # Using the position constraint
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r_xz**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle from the z-axis to the line to the target
    alpha = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # For the flipped orientation case [π, y, π]
    if flipped:
        # Looking at the correct solutions, we need to handle this case differently
        # First, check if the current solution is close to the desired orientation
        if abs((theta1 + theta2) - ry) > 0.1:
            # If not, we need to try different configurations
            
            # Try the negative theta2 solution
            theta2_neg = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)
            beta_neg = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2_neg), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2_neg))
            theta1_neg = alpha - beta_neg
            
            # Check if this solution is closer to the desired orientation
            if abs((theta1_neg + theta2_neg) - ry) < abs((theta1 + theta2) - ry):
                theta1, theta2 = theta1_neg, theta2_neg
            
            # If still not close, we might need to add π to theta1
            if abs((theta1 + theta2) - ry) > 0.1:
                theta1 = theta1 + np.pi
                
                # Check if this solution is better
                if abs((theta1 + theta2) - ry) > 0.1:
                    # If still not good, try the other theta2 with adjusted theta1
                    theta1 = alpha - beta_neg + np.pi
                    theta2 = theta2_neg
        
        # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
        while theta1 > np.pi:
            theta1 = theta1 - 2 * np.pi
        while theta1 < -np.pi:
            theta1 = theta1 + 2 * np.pi
            
        while theta2 > np.pi:
            theta2 = theta2 - 2 * np.pi
        while theta2 < -np.pi:
            theta2 = theta2 + 2 * np.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I see that my approach still isn't capturing the correct relationship. Let me try a more systematic approach:

    for theta1, theta2 in solutions:

            theta1 = theta1 - 2 * np.pi
        while theta1 < -np.pi:
            theta1 = theta1 + 2 * np.pi
            
        while theta2 > np.pi:

            min_error = error

    return best_solution

Let me make one final revision to ensure the solution is correct:
