I see the results of the forward kinematics test with joint1 = 0.5 and joint2 = 0.7. This helps me understand how the robot's position and orientation change based on joint angles.

Let me analyze this information to develop the inverse kinematics solution that handles both position and orientation:

1. From the forward kinematics results, I can see that:
   - Joint 1 rotation (0.5 rad) affects the position and orientation
   - Joint 2 rotation (0.7 rad) further affects the position and orientation
   - The final orientation of the TCP is [0, 1.2, 0], which is the sum of joint1 and joint2 angles [0, 0.5+0.7, 0]

2. Looking at the robot configuration from the DETAILS section:
   - Both revolute joints rotate around the Y axis
   - The orientation parameter in the inverse kinematics function is [x, y, z] in radians

3. For a 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around the Y axis, the orientation can only be controlled in one dimension (around Y)

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics function that handles both position and orientation:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Extract the Y rotation from the orientation
    y_rotation = r[1]
    
    # Link lengths and offset
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    y_offset = -0.1197
    
    # Calculate the position-based solution first
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - l1 ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 based on position
    beta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # Now adjust for orientation
    # For a 2-DOF robot with Y-axis rotations, the total orientation is the sum of joint angles
    # So: y_rotation = theta1 + theta2
    # We already have theta1 and theta2 from position calculations
    # Check if the current solution satisfies the orientation constraint
    current_orientation = theta1 + theta2
    
    # If not, we need to use the other IK solution (negative theta2)
    if abs(current_orientation - y_rotation) > 1e-6:
        # Try the other solution with negative theta2
        theta2 = -theta2
        alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
        theta1 = beta - alpha
        
        # If this still doesn't match the desired orientation, we need to directly solve
        current_orientation = theta1 + theta2
        if abs(current_orientation - y_rotation) > 1e-6:
            # Since we have 2 DOF and need to satisfy both position and orientation,
            # we need to directly solve for theta1 and theta2
            theta2 = y_rotation - theta1
            
            # Verify this solution still reaches the target position
            # If not, the target position and orientation may not be simultaneously reachable
            # But the problem states all targets will be reachable
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The approach above doesn't fully account for the constraints of the system. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Extract the Y rotation from the orientation
    y_rotation = r[1]
    
    # Link lengths and offset
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    y_offset = -0.1197
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around Y axis,
    # the orientation is directly determined by the sum of joint angles
    # theta1 + theta2 = y_rotation
    
    # We need to solve for position and orientation simultaneously
    # From the position, we can determine the end-effector location
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - l1 ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta2
    theta2_pos = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_neg = -theta2_pos
    
    # Calculate corresponding theta1 values for both theta2 solutions
    beta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # For positive theta2
    alpha_pos = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2_pos), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2_pos))
    theta1_pos = beta - alpha_pos
    
    # For negative theta2
    alpha_neg = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2_neg), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2_neg))
    theta1_neg = beta - alpha_neg
    
    # Check which solution better satisfies the orientation constraint
    orientation_pos = theta1_pos + theta2_pos
    orientation_neg = theta1_neg + theta2_neg
    
    # Choose the solution that gives an orientation closer to the desired y_rotation
    if abs(orientation_pos - y_rotation) <= abs(orientation_neg - y_rotation):
        return (theta1_pos, theta2_pos)
    else:
        return (theta1_neg, theta2_neg)
```

This solution still isn't quite right. For a 2-DOF robot, we can't independently control both position (3 DOF) and orientation (3 DOF). Let me revise one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:

    y_rotation = r[1]
    
    # Link lengths and offset
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    y_offset = -0.1197
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot, we can only control position OR orientation fully
    # Since we're asked to reach both, we'll prioritize position and get as close as possible to the orientation
    
    # First, calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    r_xy = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (r_xy ** 2 - l1 ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
