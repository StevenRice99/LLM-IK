I'll analyze the forward kinematics results to understand how the robot's joint angles relate to the TCP position and orientation. This will help me develop the inverse kinematics solution.

From the forward kinematics test with joint1 = 0.5 and joint2 = 0.7, I can observe:

1. The orientation of each link is represented as [0, θ, 0], confirming rotation around the Y-axis
2. Joint angles directly affect the orientation values (joint1 = 0.5 → orientation of first link is [0, 0.5, 0])
3. The second joint's orientation is cumulative (joint1 + joint2 = 0.5 + 0.7 = 1.2)

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution that handles both position and orientation:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # For this robot, only the y-component of orientation matters (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The second joint's orientation is the sum of both joint angles
    # So joint2 = ry - joint1
    
    # First solve for position using the existing solution
    y_target = y - y_offset
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (r_xz ** 2 - l1 ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Check if the orientation constraint is satisfied
    # If not, we need to find an alternative solution
    if abs(theta1 + theta2 - ry) > 1e-10:
        # We need the negative solution for theta2
        theta2 = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)
        psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
        theta1 = phi - psi
        
        # If orientation still doesn't match, we need to use orientation as the primary constraint
        if abs(theta1 + theta2 - ry) > 1e-10:
            # Set theta1 based on orientation constraint
            theta1 = ry - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. The orientation constraint is more complex than I initially thought. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # For this robot, only the y-component of orientation matters (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The orientation at the TCP is the sum of both joint angles
    # So theta1 + theta2 = ry
    
    # We need to solve for position and orientation simultaneously
    # From the orientation constraint: theta1 + theta2 = ry
    # So theta1 = ry - theta2
    
    # Substitute this into the position equations
    y_target = y - y_offset
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r_xz ** 2 - l1 ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta2
    theta2_pos = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_neg = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate corresponding theta1 values
    theta1_pos = ry - theta2_pos
    theta1_neg = ry - theta2_neg
    
    # Check which solution satisfies the position constraint
    # For theta1_pos, theta2_pos
    x_pos = l1 * np.sin(theta1_pos) + l2 * np.sin(theta1_pos + theta2_pos)
    z_pos = l1 * np.cos(theta1_pos) + l2 * np.cos(theta1_pos + theta2_pos)
    
    # For theta1_neg, theta2_neg
    x_neg = l1 * np.sin(theta1_neg) + l2 * np.sin(theta1_neg + theta2_neg)
    z_neg = l1 * np.cos(theta1_neg) + l2 * np.cos(theta1_neg + theta2_neg)
    
    # Choose the solution that best matches the target position
    err_pos = (x - x_pos)**2 + (z - z_pos)**2
    err_neg = (x - x_neg)**2 + (z - z_neg)**2
    
    if err_pos <= err_neg:
        return (theta1_pos, theta2_pos)
    else:
        return (theta1_neg, theta2_neg)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful with the forward kinematics equations. Let me finalize the solution:

    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r_xz**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
