Thank you for the feedback. I notice that my solution is failing to correctly handle the orientation component. Looking at the failed cases, I can see a pattern: the orientation input has x and z components equal to π (3.141592653589793), but my solution is ignoring these and only using the y component.

Let me analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback to understand the relationship between the input orientation and the joint angles:

1. When the orientation input has [π, y, π], the correct solution seems to account for this specific orientation format.
2. The orientation [π, y, π] appears to represent a different configuration than [0, y, 0].

Let me revise my inverse kinematics solution to properly handle the orientation:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # Check if we have the special orientation case [π, y, π]
    flipped = (abs(rx - np.pi) < 1e-10) and (abs(rz - np.pi) < 1e-10)
    
    # Using the position constraint
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r_xz**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (two possible solutions)
    theta2_pos = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_neg = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    beta_pos = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2_pos), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2_pos))
    beta_neg = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2_neg), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2_neg))
    
    # Calculate the angle from the z-axis to the line to the target
    alpha = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # If we have the special orientation case [π, y, π], we need to flip the z-axis
    if flipped:
        alpha = np.arctan2(x, -z)
    
    # Calculate theta1 for both solutions
    theta1_pos = alpha - beta_pos
    theta1_neg = alpha - beta_neg
    
    # Check which solution better satisfies the orientation constraint
    # For the special case [π, y, π], we need to consider the flipped configuration
    if flipped:
        # For the flipped case, the orientation constraint is different
        err_pos = abs((theta1_pos + theta2_pos) - ry)
        err_neg = abs((theta1_neg + theta2_neg) - ry)
    else:
        err_pos = abs((theta1_pos + theta2_pos) - ry)
        err_neg = abs((theta1_neg + theta2_neg) - ry)
    
    # Choose the solution with the smaller orientation error
    if err_pos <= err_neg:
        return (theta1_pos, theta2_pos)
    else:
        return (theta1_neg, theta2_neg)
```

After further analysis of the feedback, I see that my approach still isn't capturing the correct relationship. Let me revise more thoroughly:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """

    x, y, z = p

    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # Check if we have the special orientation case [π, y, π]
    flipped = (abs(rx - np.pi) < 1e-10) and (abs(rz - np.pi) < 1e-10)
    
    # For the flipped case, we need to negate z
    if flipped:
        z = -z
    
    # Using the position constraint
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    beta_neg = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2_neg), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2_neg))
    
    # Calculate the angle from the z-axis to the line to the target

    # Calculate theta1 for both solutions
    theta1_pos = alpha - beta_pos
    theta1_neg = alpha - beta_neg
    
    # For the flipped case, we need to adjust theta1
    if flipped:
        theta1_pos = theta1_pos + np.pi
        theta1_neg = theta1_neg + np.pi
    
    # Check which solution better satisfies the orientation constraint
    err_pos = abs((theta1_pos + theta2_pos) - ry)
    err_neg = abs((theta1_neg + theta2_neg) - ry)
    
    # Choose the solution with the smaller orientation error
    if err_pos <= err_neg:
        return (theta1_pos, theta2_pos)
    else:
        return (theta1_neg, theta2_neg)
```

Let me make one final revision to ensure the solution is correct:
