Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution is failing to correctly handle the orientation component. Looking at the failed test cases, I notice a pattern: many of the target orientations include rotations around the X and Z axes (with values of π or 3.141592653589793), which my solution wasn't accounting for.

Let me revise my approach to properly handle the orientation requirements:

Wait, I need to revise this solution. Looking at the failed test cases more carefully, I see that when x_rot and z_rot are π, the orientation is flipped, which means we need a different approach:

    y_rot = r[1]
    z_rot = r[2]

    # If flip is needed, we need to consider that the Y orientation is also flipped
    if flip_needed:
        # For flipped configurations, the Y orientation is negated

I'm still not fully capturing the relationship between the joint angles and the orientation. Let me revise one more time with a clearer understanding:

I'm still not capturing the relationship correctly. Let me analyze the failed test cases more carefully:

Looking at the first failed case:
- Target position: [-0.139652647726756, -0.1197, -0.035240979391217]
- Target orientation: [3.141592653589793, 0.300491431039125, 3.141592653589793]
- Correct joint values: [-0.6457223405287691, 3.486823563079438]
