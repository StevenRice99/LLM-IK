Based on the FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution that accounts for both position and orientation. Let me analyze what I've learned:

1. The robot has 2 revolute joints, both rotating around the Y axis
2. The orientation parameter in the output is represented as [0, joint1+joint2, 0]
3. The TCP position depends on both joint angles

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # The orientation around Y axis is the sum of joint angles
    # ry = theta1 + theta2
    # So theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # First, solve for position using the existing approach
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine sign of theta2 based on cross product
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Now adjust for orientation
    # Since ry = theta1 + theta2, we need to ensure this constraint is met
    # We have two options:
    # 1. Use the position-based solution and check if it satisfies orientation
    # 2. Use the orientation constraint and solve for position
    
    # Let's use the orientation constraint
    # If ry = theta1 + theta2, then theta1 = ry - theta2
    theta1_orient = ry - theta2
    
    # Now we need to check if this theta1 can reach the desired position
    # We'll use the theta1 from orientation and recalculate theta2 for position
    
    # For a given theta1, we can calculate theta2 to reach the position
    # First, transform the target position to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1_orient)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1_orient)
    
    # Rotate the target position by -theta1 around Y
    x_prime = c1 * x + s1 * z
    z_prime = -s1 * x + c1 * z
    
    # Now solve for theta2 to reach this position
    # The distance from joint 2 to target is:
    d_prime = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + (z_prime - L1)**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2_prime = (d_prime**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # If this is not possible, we can't satisfy both position and orientation
    # Since we're told all targets are reachable, we'll proceed
    
    # For this robot, since both joints rotate around Y,
    # we can directly use the orientation constraint
    # theta1 + theta2 = ry
    
    # So our solution is:
    theta1 = theta1_orient
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. The orientation constraint is that theta1 + theta2 = ry, but we also need to ensure the position constraint is met. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # For this robot, the orientation around Y axis is the sum of joint angles
    # ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    # We need to find theta1 and theta2 that satisfy both:
    # 1. Position constraint (x, y, z)
    # 2. Orientation constraint (theta1 + theta2 = ry)
    
    # From the orientation constraint:
    # theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # Substituting this into the forward kinematics equations:
    # x = L1*sin(theta1) + L2*sin(theta1 + theta2)
    # z = L1*cos(theta1) + L2*cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Using theta2 = ry - theta1:
    # x = L1*sin(theta1) + L2*sin(ry)
    # z = L1*cos(theta1) + L2*cos(ry)
    
    # Rearranging:
    # x - L2*sin(ry) = L1*sin(theta1)
    # z - L2*cos(ry) = L1*cos(theta1)
    
    # Square and add these equations:
    # (x - L2*sin(ry))² + (z - L2*cos(ry))² = L1²
    
    # Calculate intermediate values
    sin_ry = math.sin(ry)
    cos_ry = math.cos(ry)
    
    # Calculate the adjusted target position
    x_adj = x - L2 * sin_ry
    z_adj = z - L2 * cos_ry
    
    # Check if the adjusted position is reachable by joint 1
    d_adj = math.sqrt(x_adj**2 + z_adj**2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    
    # Calculate theta2 from the orientation constraint
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Let me check this solution once more:

The key insight is that for a 2-DOF planar manipulator with revolute joints around the Y axis:
1. The orientation around Y is the sum of the joint angles: ry = theta1 + theta2
2. Given this constraint, we can solve for the position by finding theta1 that places joint 2 in a position where the end effector can reach the target with the required orientation

I believe the solution is correct:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # For this robot, the orientation around Y axis is the sum of joint angles
    # ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Calculate intermediate values
    sin_ry = math.sin(ry)
    cos_ry = math.cos(ry)
    
    # Calculate the adjusted target position
    x_adj = x - L2 * sin_ry
    z_adj = z - L2 * cos_ry
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    
    # Calculate theta2 from the orientation constraint
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
