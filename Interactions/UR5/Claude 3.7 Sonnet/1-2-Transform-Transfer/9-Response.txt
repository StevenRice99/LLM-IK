I apologize for the error. I forgot to include the import statement for the math module. Let me correct the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # For this robot, the orientation around Y axis is the sum of joint angles
    # ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Calculate intermediate values
    sin_ry = math.sin(ry)
    cos_ry = math.cos(ry)
    
    # Calculate the adjusted target position
    x_adj = x - L2 * sin_ry
    z_adj = z - L2 * cos_ry
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    
    # Calculate theta2 from the orientation constraint
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution works by:
1. Recognizing that for a 2-DOF planar manipulator with revolute joints around the Y axis, the orientation around Y is the sum of the joint angles: ry = theta1 + theta2
2. Using this orientation constraint, we can work backward from the target position to find where joint 2 must be positioned
3. We subtract the contribution of link 2 (oriented at ry) from the target position to find where joint 2 must be
4. We then calculate theta1 to position joint 2 at this location
5. Finally, we calculate theta2 using the orientation constraint: theta2 = ry - theta1

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation constraints are satisfied simultaneously.
