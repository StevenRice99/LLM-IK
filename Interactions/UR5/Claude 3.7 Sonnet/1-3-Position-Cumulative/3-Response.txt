Thank you for providing the forward kinematics results. This helps me understand how the robot's joints affect the end effector position. Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator.

Let me analyze the robot structure based on the details provided:

1. All three joints are revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis
2. The TCP (end effector) has an offset from the last joint
3. I need to find the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that position the TCP at a given point p(x, y, z)

Looking at the existing solutions:
- Existing code 1 solves for a single joint (joint 2)
- Existing code 2 solves for joints 1 and 2 in a 2-DOF system

Let me develop the complete solution for all three joints:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # Since TCP is offset in y direction, we need to adjust the y coordinate
    y_target = y - y_offset_joint2 - y_offset_tcp
    
    # The x and z coordinates define the projection in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For a 3-DOF manipulator with all joints rotating around Y-axis,
    # we can solve for joint 1 directly from the target position
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 in the plane defined by joint 1
    # This is a 2-DOF planar manipulator problem
    
    # We can use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + y_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta3 (elbow up/down)
    # We'll choose the elbow-up configuration
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me think more carefully about the robot's geometry:

1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis, which means the robot operates in the XZ plane
2. The y-coordinate is affected by the offsets in the Y direction

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation in XZ plane)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target onto the plane defined by joint 1
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust for joint 2 offset
    y_target = y_adjusted - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Use the 2-DOF solution from existing code 2 as a basis
    # Calculate joint 3 using law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + y_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful about the geometry. Let me complete the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the DETAILS section
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (joint 3 to TCP before y offset)
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # First, calculate theta1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset in y direction
    y_target = y - y_offset_tcp - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Project the target onto the plane defined by theta1
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Now we need to solve the 2-link planar manipulator problem in the r-y plane
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + y_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now solve for theta2
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target, r)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
