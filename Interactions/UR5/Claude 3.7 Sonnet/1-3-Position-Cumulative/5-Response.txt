Thank you for the feedback. I see the pattern in the errors now. Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that Î¸3 is consistently 0 in all the correct solutions, which means the third joint isn't being used in the correct solutions.

Let me revise my approach. The robot appears to be using only the first two joints to reach the target positions, with the third joint always at 0. This suggests that the inverse kinematics solution should be similar to the one in "EXISTING 2", but with adjustments to account for the full chain.

Here's my revised solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # Since the TCP has an offset in the y direction from joint 3
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust for joint 2 offset
    y_target = y_adjusted - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using the law of cosines
    # We're treating links 2 and 3 as a single link since joint 3 is always 0
    l_combined = np.sqrt(l2**2 + y_offset_tcp**2)  # Combined length of link 2 and TCP offset
    
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + y_target**2 - l1**2 - l_combined**2) / (2 * l1 * l_combined)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the horizontal
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the line to the target
    gamma = np.arctan2(l_combined * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l_combined * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    theta1 = phi - gamma
    
    # Joint 3 is always 0 based on the correct solutions
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. The TCP offset is in the y-direction, but the joints rotate around the y-axis. This means the TCP offset doesn't affect the kinematics in the same way I initially thought.

Let me revise again:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset in y direction
    y_target = y - y_offset_tcp - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + y_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the line to the target
    psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Joint 3 is always 0 based on the correct solutions
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful about the signs and the geometry. Let me revise one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225 + 0.093  # Length of link 2 plus TCP offset
    
    # Adjust target position for joint 2 offset
    y_target = y - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + y_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the line to the target
    psi = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    # Joint 3 is always 0 based on the correct solutions
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I'm still not accounting for the geometry correctly. Let me make one final revision:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # We need to subtract the TCP offset from the target y-coordinate
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust for joint 2 offset
    y_target = y_adjusted - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + y_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)  # Negative to match the correct solutions
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the horizontal
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the line to the target
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(-theta2), l1 + l2 * np.cos(-theta2))
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    theta1 = phi - gamma
    
    # Joint 3 is always 0 based on the correct solutions
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Based on the feedback and the correct solutions, I'll provide my final solution:

```python

    """
