Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure:

1. All three revolute joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The links form a planar manipulator in the XZ plane
3. The TCP has an offset in the Y direction from the last joint

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425       # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.39225     # Length of link 2 (Z direction)
    y_offset1 = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from joint 3
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Joint 1 calculation
    # Since all joints rotate around Y-axis, joint 1 determines the plane of operation
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Project the target onto the XZ plane defined by theta1
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    # We're solving for the angle between links 1 and 2
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and atan2
    beta = math.atan2(r, y_adjusted - y_offset1)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.0267, 0.81725]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.0, the TCP rotates in the XZ plane
3. Joints 2 and 3 control the extension in the plane defined by joint 1

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425       # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.39225     # Length of link 2 (Z direction)
    y_offset1 = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from joint 3
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Project the target onto the plane defined by theta1
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Adjust y-target to account for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + (y_adjusted - y_offset1)**2)
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    beta = math.atan2(r, y_adjusted - y_offset1)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, I need to reconsider this again. Looking at the forward kinematics results more carefully:

1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. When joint 1 is at 1.0, the entire arm rotates around the Y-axis
3. Joints 2 and 3 control the extension in their local planes

Let me provide the correct solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425       # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225     # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from joint 3
    
    # Adjust target for TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target - tcp_offset
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Project the target onto the plane defined by theta1
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we're solving a 2D inverse kinematics problem
    # in the plane defined by joint 1
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + (y_adjusted - y_offset)**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    k1 = l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta3)
    k2 = l2 * math.sin(theta3)
    gamma = math.atan2(k2, k1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, y_adjusted - y_offset) - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
