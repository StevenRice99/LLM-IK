Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Looking at the correct joint values, I notice a pattern: the third joint (joint3) is always 0 in the correct solutions. This suggests that the robot might be using only 2 joints to reach the target positions in the XZ plane.

Let me revise my approach completely:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # The TCP has a fixed y-offset of -0.0267 from the last joint
    # Since all targets have y = -0.0267, we know the last joint is always at y = -0.0267
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This rotates the entire arm in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by joint 1
    # The distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    r_target = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 in Z
    l2 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in Z
    l3 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP in Y
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    
    # Based on the feedback, it appears joint 3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # With joint 3 = 0, the effective length of links 2 and 3 combined is just l2
    # The position of joint 3 in the rotated plane is:
    # - Distance from origin in XZ plane: r_joint3
    # - Height: y_joint3
    
    # Since joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is offset only in the Y direction
    # The position of joint 3 (before TCP offset) is:
    # r_joint3 = r_target
    # y_joint3 = y_target - l3 = -0.0267 - 0.093 = -0.1197
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 2 to reach this position
    # We have a right triangle with:
    # - Hypotenuse: l1
    # - Adjacent side: r_joint3
    # - Opposite side: y_joint3 - y_offset
    
    # Calculate theta2 using inverse tangent
    # We need to find the angle that joint 2 makes with the horizontal
    y_diff = -0.1197 - y_offset  # This is 0 since y_joint3 = y_offset = -0.1197
    
    # The effective length from joint 1 to joint 3 (in the XZ plane)
    l_effective = math.sqrt(l1**2 + l2**2 + 2*l1*l2*math.cos(theta3))
    
    # The angle between l1 and l_effective
    alpha = math.atan2(l2*math.sin(theta3), l1 + l2*math.cos(theta3))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # We need to find the angle that makes the end of the arm reach r_target
    # Using the law of cosines: r_target^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(pi - theta2)
    cos_theta2 = (r_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (-2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Clamp to handle floating point errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Since we're working in a 2D plane and the arm bends, we use:
    theta2 = math.pi - math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust based on the feedback examples
    if r_target < l1 - l2:  # Target is too close to the base
        theta2 = 0
    elif r_target > l1 + l2:  # Target is too far from the base
        theta2 = math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. Looking at the feedback more carefully, I see that the correct solutions have joint3 = 0, but joint2 varies significantly. Let me revise:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # The distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    r_target = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 in Z
    l2 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in Z
    l3 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP in Y
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # With joint 3 = 0, the effective length of links 2 and 3 combined is just l2
    # The TCP is offset from joint 3 by l3 in the Y direction
    
    # Since all targets have y = -0.0267, and the TCP is offset by l3 = 0.093 in Y,
    # joint 3 must be at y = -0.0267 - 0.093 = -0.1197
    
    # This means joint 3 is at the same Y level as joint 2 (y_offset = -0.1197)
    # So the arm must be extending straight out in the XZ plane
    
    # The total reach in the XZ plane is l1 + l2 = 0.425 + 0.39225 = 0.81725
    
    # Calculate theta2 to reach the target distance r_target
    # Using the law of cosines: r_target^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(pi - theta2)
    cos_theta2 = (r_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (-2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Clamp to handle floating point errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Since we're working in a 2D plane and the arm bends, we use:
    theta2 = math.pi - math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not capturing the correct solution. Let me analyze the feedback examples more carefully:

```python
import math

    """

    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # The distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    r_target = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 in Z
    l2 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in Z
    l3 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP in Y
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # With joint 3 = 0, the effective length from joint 2 to TCP is:
    # - In XZ plane: l2
    # - In Y direction: l3
    
    # The position of joint 2 in the Y direction is fixed at y_offset = -0.1197
    # The TCP is at y_target = -0.0267
    # So the Y difference that must be accounted for is: -0.0267 - (-0.1197) = 0.093
    # This matches exactly with l3, confirming that joint 3 should be 0
    
    # Now we need to calculate theta2 to make the arm reach r_target in the XZ plane
    # When joint 3 is 0, the arm extends straight from joint 2 by length l2
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2:
    # r_target^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - r_target**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)

    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Looking at the feedback examples, I need to adjust the sign of theta2
    # based on whether the arm needs to bend up or down
    
    # If the target is below the XZ plane (negative Z), theta2 should be negative
    if z_target < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not capturing the pattern correctly. Let me try a different approach by analyzing the examples more carefully:

```python
import math

    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # The distance from origin to target in the XZ plane

    # Calculate the angle
    angle = math.acos(cos_angle)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the examples
    # Looking at the examples, theta2 is negative when the target is in front (positive Z)
    # and positive when the target is behind (negative Z)
    if z_target >= 0:
        theta2 = -(math.pi - angle)
    else:
        theta2 = math.pi - angle
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After analyzing the examples more carefully, I see that the relationship is more complex. Let me try one more approach:
