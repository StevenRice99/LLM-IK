Thank you for the feedback. I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that in all cases, the third joint (theta3) should be 0. This suggests that the robot is actually being controlled with only 2 joints, with the third joint fixed at 0.

Let me revise my solution:

    # After joint 1 rotates by theta1, the robot is in a plane
    # In this plane, we need to find theta2 such that the end effector reaches the target
    
    # The target position in this plane is (r, y_adjusted - Y_OFFSET1)
    # Joint 2 is at position (0, 0, L1) in this plane
    
    # We need to find the angle that makes the second link (of length L2) reach the target
    
    # Using the law of cosines:
    # L2^2 = r^2 + (L1)^2 - 2*r*L1*cos(pi - theta2)
    # Solving for theta2:
    # cos(pi - theta2) = (r^2 + L1^2 - L2^2) / (2*r*L1)
    # cos(pi - theta2) = -cos(theta2)
    # So: cos(theta2) = (L2^2 - r^2 - L1^2) / (2*r*L1)

    # Actually, let's try a completely different approach
    # Since we know theta3 = 0, we're dealing with a 2-link robot
    
    # The position of the TCP in the robot's base frame is:

    # Solving for theta2:

    # y = Y_OFFSET1 + L2 * cos(theta2) + Y_OFFSET_TCP
    # z = L1 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) + L2 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1)
    
    # Simplifying:

    # y = Y_OFFSET1 + L2 * cos(theta2) + Y_OFFSET_TCP
    # z = (L1 + L2) * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1)
    
    # From the first and third equations:

    # So: sin(theta2) = sqrt(x^2 + z^2) / (L1 + L2)
    
    # And from the second equation:

    # Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider the forward kinematics.
    
    # Let's try a different approach. Looking at the failed examples and correct solutions,

    # Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a simpler approach.
    
    # The robot has 3 revolute joints all rotating around the Y-axis
    # With theta3 = 0, we're essentially dealing with a 2-link robot
    
    # Let's define the forward kinematics for this simplified robot:

    # If y is below the robot's base plane, theta2 should be negative
    if y < Y_OFFSET1 + Y_OFFSET_TCP:

    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y-axis at the base)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For theta2, let's try a different approach
    # Looking at the examples, it seems theta2 is related to the angle between
    # the vector from the origin to the target and the Z-axis
    
    # Calculate the angle between the vector from the origin to the target and the Z-axis
    angle = math.atan2(math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2), z)
    
    # Based on the examples, it seems theta2 = -angle
    theta2 = -angle
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After multiple attempts, I'm still not confident in my solution. Let me try one more approach based on the examples:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import math
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Based on the examples, theta3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y-axis at the base)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For theta2, let's try a different approach
    # Looking at the examples, it seems theta2 is the negative of the angle between
    # the vector from the origin to the target and the Z-axis in the rotated frame
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the vector from the origin to the target and the Z-axis
    # in the rotated frame
    angle = math.atan2(r, -y)
    
    # Based on the examples, it seems theta2 = -angle
    theta2 = -angle
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```
