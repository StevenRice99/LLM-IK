I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and forward kinematics results to derive the solution.

Based on the provided information and forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
1. All three joints rotate around the Y-axis (revolute joints)
2. The TCP position changes based on the joint angles
3. The robot has a specific link structure with offsets

Let me solve this step by step:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    # Link 1 position: [0, 0, 0]
    # Link 2 position: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # Link 3 position: [0, 0, 0.39225]
    # TCP offset: [0, 0.093, 0]
    
    L1 = 0.425  # Z-offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    Y_OFFSET1 = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    Y_OFFSET_TCP = 0.093  # Y-offset of TCP from joint 3
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y - Y_OFFSET_TCP
    
    # Since all joints rotate around Y-axis, the X-Z plane is affected
    # Joint 1 determines the orientation in X-Z plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in X-Z plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve the 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # in the plane defined by the X-Z projection and Y
    
    # The Y coordinate is handled by the offsets and joint 2 and 3 angles
    # We need to solve for joint angles that position the end effector at (r, y_adjusted)
    # from the base of joint 2
    
    # Calculate the coordinates relative to joint 2
    r2 = r
    y2 = y_adjusted - Y_OFFSET1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r2**2 + y2**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle floating-point errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines
    beta = np.arctan2(y2, r2)
    gamma = np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to double-check my solution. Let me reconsider the geometry:

The robot has 3 revolute joints all rotating around the Y-axis, which means the robot moves in a plane that can rotate around the Z-axis. The first joint (theta1) determines this plane's orientation.

Looking at the forward kinematics results, I notice that:
1. When theta1 changes, the TCP rotates around the Z-axis
2. When theta2 changes, the second link rotates
3. When theta3 changes, the third link rotates

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters
    L1 = 0.425  # Z-offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    Y_OFFSET1 = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    Y_OFFSET_TCP = 0.093  # Y-offset of TCP from joint 3
    
    # Joint 1 determines the orientation in X-Z plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in X-Z plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y - Y_OFFSET_TCP
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve the 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # We're solving for a 2-link planar robot with link lengths L1 and L2
    # The target position is (r, y_adjusted + 0.1197) relative to joint 1
    
    # Target position relative to joint 1
    r_target = r
    y_target = y_adjusted - Y_OFFSET1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    D = (r_target**2 + y_target**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle floating-point errors
    D = np.clip(D, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(D)
    
    # Now find theta2
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y_target, r_target) - np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * np.cos(theta3))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution should correctly calculate the joint angles needed to reach the target position. The approach:
1. Calculate theta1 based on the X-Z plane orientation
2. Transform the target to a 2D problem in the plane defined by theta1
3. Use the law of cosines and trigonometry to solve for theta2 and theta3
