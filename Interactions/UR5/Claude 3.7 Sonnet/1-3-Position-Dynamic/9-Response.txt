Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can observe:
1. All three joints rotate around the Y-axis (revolute joints)
2. The robot has a specific link structure with offsets
3. The TCP has an offset in the y-direction

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the DETAILS
    l1 = 0.425       # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225     # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    y_offset1 = -0.1197  # Y-offset of link 2
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093  # Y-offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_target = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Joint 1 calculation (rotation around Y-axis in the XZ plane)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve the 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # in the plane defined by the XZ distance and the Y height
    
    # Calculate the vertical distance from joint 1 to target
    y_diff = y_target - y_offset1
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint angles
    # Distance from joint 2 to target point
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_diff**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 using law of cosines
    cos_joint3 = (r**2 + y_diff**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle floating point errors
    cos_joint3 = max(min(cos_joint3, 1.0), -1.0)
    joint3 = np.arccos(cos_joint3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 using law of cosines and atan2
    beta = np.arccos((l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d))
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_diff, r)
    joint2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Handle the case where the target is behind the robot
    if z < 0 and x == 0:
        joint2 = np.pi - joint2
        joint3 = -joint3
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates joint 1 angle using arctan2 to determine the rotation in the XZ plane
2. Adjusts for the TCP offset in the y-direction
3. Uses the law of cosines to solve the 2-link planar manipulator problem for joints 2 and 3
4. Handles special cases where the target is behind the robot

The solution accounts for all the link offsets and provides the joint angles in radians as required.
