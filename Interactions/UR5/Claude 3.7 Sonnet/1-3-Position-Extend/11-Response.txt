I see that my solution is still not correct. Looking at the feedback more carefully, I notice that there's a pattern in the correct joint values. Let me analyze the examples more thoroughly:

1. In some cases, theta2 is positive, and in others, it's negative
2. The relationship between theta1 and the target position is more complex than I initially thought

Let me try a different approach by examining the examples more carefully:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of link 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction from joint 3
    y_joint3 = y_target - tcp_offset
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Calculate the vertical distance (accounting for the y_offset of joint 2)
    h = y_joint3 - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the direct distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between the two links
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for theta2 (elbow up or elbow down)
    # Based on the examples, we need to determine which one to use
    theta2_elbow_up = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_elbow_down = -theta2_elbow_up
    
    # Find the angle of the target with respect to the horizontal plane
    beta = math.atan2(h, r)
    
    # Find the angle of the first link with respect to the horizontal
    cos_alpha = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y axis)
    theta1_base = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Calculate the two possible configurations
    theta1_elbow_up = theta1_base - alpha
    theta1_elbow_down = theta1_base + alpha
    
    # Determine which configuration to use based on the examples
    # Looking at the examples, it seems we need to choose based on the target position
    
    # Let's try a heuristic: if z_target is negative, use elbow down, otherwise use elbow up
    if z_target < 0:
        theta1 = theta1_elbow_down
        theta2 = theta2_elbow_down
    else:
        theta1 = theta1_elbow_up
        theta2 = theta2_elbow_up
    
    # Based on the examples, theta3 is consistently 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, this heuristic doesn't match the examples. Let me try a different approach by analyzing the examples more carefully:

After analyzing the examples more carefully, I see that the relationship is more complex. Let me try one more approach:

    if abs(theta1_elbow_up) + abs(theta2_elbow_up) < abs(theta1_elbow_down) + abs(theta2_elbow_down):

After careful analysis of the examples, I believe the issue is with the configuration selection. Let me try one final approach:
