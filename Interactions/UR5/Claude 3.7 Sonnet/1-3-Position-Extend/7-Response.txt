Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and extend the existing solution.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see:
1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.093, 0] from the third joint
3. The existing solution solved for the first two joints assuming the third joint was the target

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of link 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction from joint 3, we need to adjust
    # the y coordinate of our target
    y_target_adjusted = y_target - tcp_offset
    
    # Joint 1 (base joint) rotates around Y axis
    # It determines the orientation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we're working in the plane defined by the arm
    # This is a 2D problem in the r-y plane
    
    # Adjust y coordinate to account for the offset of joint 2
    y_adjusted = y_target_adjusted - y_offset
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + y_adjusted**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Find theta3 using the fact that the end effector must be at the target
    # First, find the angle of the line from the base to the target
    phi = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r)
    
    # Then find the angle of the first link
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Joint 2 angle
    theta2_final = phi - alpha
    
    # Joint 3 angle (relative to joint 2)
    theta3 = -theta2  # This makes the end effector horizontal
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results more carefully.

Looking at the test with joint values (0, 0, 1.0), I see that joint 3 rotation doesn't change the TCP position, only its orientation. This means the TCP position is determined only by joints 1 and 2.

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of link 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction from joint 3, we need to adjust
    # the y coordinate of our target
    y_target_adjusted = y_target - tcp_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + (y_target_adjusted - y_offset)**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Find the angle of joint 1
    beta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # For joint 3, we can set it to any value since it doesn't affect the position
    # For simplicity, we'll set it to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Actually, I need to reconsider this again. The existing solution doesn't account for the y-offset or the TCP offset. Let me test one more configuration to better understand the kinematics.
