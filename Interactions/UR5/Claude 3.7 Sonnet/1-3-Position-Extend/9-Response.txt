Thank you for the feedback. I see that my approach was incorrect. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a proper solution.

Looking at the correct solutions, I notice:
1. The third joint value is consistently 0 in all correct solutions
2. The relationship between the target positions and joint angles is more complex than I initially thought

Let me revise my approach by carefully analyzing the robot's kinematics:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of link 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 3 (before TCP offset)
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction from joint 3
    y_joint3 = y_target - tcp_offset
    x_joint3 = x_target
    z_joint3 = z_target
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane from the base to joint 3
    r = math.sqrt(x_joint3**2 + z_joint3**2)
    
    # Calculate the vertical distance from the base to joint 3
    h = y_joint3 - y_offset
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 2
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > l1 + l2:
        # Target is too far away
        # Since we're told all targets are reachable, this shouldn't happen
        # But we'll handle it by setting the arm to reach as far as possible
        cos_theta2 = -1.0
    elif d < abs(l1 - l2):
        # Target is too close
        cos_theta2 = 1.0
    else:
        cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
        cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Now find theta1
    # First, find the angle of the line from joint 1 to joint 3 in the XZ plane
    phi_xz = math.atan2(x_joint3, z_joint3)
    
    # Then find the angle in the vertical plane
    phi_vert = math.atan2(h, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the first link in the vertical plane
    cos_alpha = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Determine theta1 based on the quadrant
    if r > 0:
        theta1 = phi_xz
        theta2_vert = phi_vert - alpha
    else:
        # Handle the case where r is very small or zero
        theta1 = phi_xz
        theta2_vert = phi_vert + alpha if h > 0 else phi_vert - alpha
    
    # The final theta2 is the angle in the vertical plane
    theta2_final = theta2_vert
    
    # Based on the examples, theta3 is consistently 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the problem more carefully.

Looking at the robot structure and the correct solutions:
1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The third joint is consistently set to 0 in the correct solutions
3. The TCP has an offset in the Y direction from joint 3

Let me revise my approach:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of link 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction from joint 3
    y_joint3 = y_target - tcp_offset
    x_joint3 = x_target
    z_joint3 = z_target
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_joint3**2 + z_joint3**2)
    
    # Calculate the vertical distance (accounting for the y_offset of joint 2)
    h = y_joint3 - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the direct distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Find the angle of the first link with respect to the horizontal plane
    cos_gamma = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_gamma = max(min(cos_gamma, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    gamma = math.acos(cos_gamma)
    
    # Find the angle of the target with respect to the horizontal plane
    beta = math.atan2(h, r)
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_joint3, z_joint3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (angle of joint 2)
    # The sign of theta2 depends on whether the arm needs to bend up or down
    if y_joint3 >= y_offset:  # Target is above or at the same level as joint 2
        theta2_final = beta - gamma
    else:  # Target is below joint 2
        theta2_final = beta + gamma
    
    # Based on the examples, theta3 is consistently 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it one more time based on the examples provided:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    y_target = p[1]
    z_target = p[2]
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction from joint 3
    y_joint3 = y_target - tcp_offset
    x_joint3 = x_target
    z_joint3 = z_target
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_joint3**2 + z_joint3**2)
    
    # Calculate the vertical distance (accounting for the y_offset of joint 2)
    h = y_joint3 - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the direct distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Find the angle of the target with respect to the horizontal plane
    beta = math.atan2(h, r)
    
    # Find the angle of the first link with respect to the target direction
    cos_gamma = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_gamma = max(min(cos_gamma, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    gamma = math.acos(cos_gamma)
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_joint3, z_joint3)

    # Based on the examples, theta3 is consistently 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3)
```

After analyzing the examples more carefully, I believe the issue is with the sign of theta2. Let me make one final revision:

    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of TCP from link 3
