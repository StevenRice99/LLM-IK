I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the correct joint values from the working inverse kinematics solver, I notice that in all cases, the third joint (theta3) is 0. This suggests that the robot is designed to be used with only the first two joints for positioning, with the third joint potentially reserved for orientation or other purposes.

Let me revise my solution based on this insight:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position coordinates
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_link2 = -0.1197
    z_offset_link2 = 0.425
    z_offset_link3 = 0.39225
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # The TCP is offset by y_offset_tcp in the y direction from the last joint
    # We need to account for this when calculating the target position for the last joint
    
    # Based on the correct solutions, we know that theta3 = 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # With theta3 = 0, the last link is straight, so the total arm length in the direction
    # of the arm is z_offset_link2 + z_offset_link3
    total_arm_length = z_offset_link2 + z_offset_link3
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle in the XZ plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate needs to account for the TCP offset and link2 offset
    y_target = y - y_offset_tcp
    y_from_base = y_target - y_offset_link2
    
    # Calculate theta2 using inverse kinematics for a 2-link planar arm
    # We need to find the angle that positions the end of the arm at (r_xz, y_from_base)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between the links
    # We have a right triangle with:
    # - Hypotenuse = total_arm_length
    # - Adjacent side = r_xz
    # - Opposite side = y_from_base
    
    # Calculate the angle between the horizontal and the line to the target
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_from_base, r_xz)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    # using the law of cosines
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_from_base**2)
    
    # If the target is beyond reach, we need to handle it
    # Since we're told all targets are reachable, this shouldn't happen,
    # but we'll add a check just to be safe
    if d > total_arm_length:
        # Target is at maximum reach, point the arm directly at the target
        theta2 = alpha
    else:
        # Calculate the angle using the law of cosines
        cos_beta = r_xz / d
        beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
        
        # Theta2 is the angle needed to position the arm
        theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not approaching this correctly. Let me reconsider the problem:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position coordinates
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_link2 = -0.1197
    z_offset_link2 = 0.425
    z_offset_link3 = 0.39225
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Based on the correct solutions, we know that theta3 = 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # With theta3 = 0, the last link extends straight from link2
    # The TCP is offset by y_offset_tcp in the y direction
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction and theta3 = 0,
    # we need to adjust the y coordinate
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # The distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The total length of links 2 and 3 when theta3 = 0
    total_arm_length = z_offset_link2 + z_offset_link3
    
    # The y-coordinate from the base to the target
    y_from_base = y_adjusted - y_offset_link2
    
    # The distance from the base of link 2 to the target
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_from_base**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the angle between the horizontal and the line to the target
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y_from_base, r_xz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting this right. Let me try a different approach by working backwards from the target position:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position coordinates
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_link2 = -0.1197
    z_offset_link2 = 0.425
    z_offset_link3 = 0.39225
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Based on the correct solutions, we know that theta3 = 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y direction when theta3 = 0
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # When theta3 = 0, the arm forms a straight line from joint 2 to the end effector
    # We need to find the angle that positions this line to reach the target
    
    # The y-coordinate from the base to the target
    y_from_base = y_adjusted - y_offset_link2
    
    # Calculate theta2 as the angle needed to reach the target
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y_from_base, r_xz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not capturing the correct relationship. Let me analyze the examples more carefully:

For example, for the target [0.675428066073634, -0.0267, -0.1728790745438], the correct joint values were [2.34621795706818, -1.098752488034753, 0].

    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)

        arm_dir_z = 1
    
    # The perpendicular direction is (-arm_dir_z, arm_dir_x)
    perp_dir_x = -arm_dir_z
    perp_dir_z = arm_dir_x
