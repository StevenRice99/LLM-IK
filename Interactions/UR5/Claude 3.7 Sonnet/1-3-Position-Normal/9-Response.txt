Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the solution step by step.

## Analysis of the Robot Structure

From the provided information and forward kinematics tests, I can observe:

1. All three joints are revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis
2. The robot has a serial chain configuration
3. The link lengths and offsets are:
   - Link 1: Position [0, 0, 0]
   - Link 2: Position [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to Link 1
   - Link 3: Position [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to Link 2
   - TCP: Position [0, 0.093, 0] relative to Link 3

## Deriving the Inverse Kinematics Solution

Let me complete the inverse_kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position coordinates
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_link2 = -0.1197
    z_offset_link2 = 0.425
    z_offset_link3 = 0.39225
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # We need to find the position of the last joint, not the TCP
    # The TCP is offset by y_offset_tcp in the y direction from the last joint
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle in the XZ plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # The robot arm lies in a plane rotated by theta1 around the Y-axis
    # Project the target point onto this plane to solve for the other angles
    
    # Distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Account for the y-offset of the TCP
    # We need to adjust the y-coordinate based on the orientation
    y_adj = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by the arm
    # with distances r_xz and y_adj
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base of link 2 to the target point
    # (accounting for the y-offset of link 2)
    y_from_link2 = y_adj - y_offset_link2
    
    # Distance from link 2 base to target
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_from_link2**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    # We have a triangle with sides: z_offset_link3, d, and z_offset_link2
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - z_offset_link2**2 - z_offset_link3**2) / (2 * z_offset_link2 * z_offset_link3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle floating-point errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Theta3 is the supplement of the angle in the triangle
    theta3 = np.pi - np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines
    # First, find the angle between d and z_offset_link2 in the triangle
    beta = np.arccos((z_offset_link2**2 + d**2 - z_offset_link3**2) / (2 * z_offset_link2 * d))
    
    # Then find the angle between d and the horizontal plane
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_from_link2, r_xz)
    
    # Theta2 is the difference between these angles
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution works by:

1. First calculating theta1, which is the rotation around the Y-axis that determines the plane in which the arm lies
2. Projecting the problem into 2D by finding the distance in the XZ plane
3. Accounting for the Y-offsets of the links and TCP
4. Using the law of cosines to find theta3
5. Using the law of sines and angles to determine theta2

The solution handles the kinematic chain properly and accounts for all the offsets in the robot structure.
