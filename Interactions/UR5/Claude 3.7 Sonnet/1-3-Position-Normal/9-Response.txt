Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the solution step by step.

## Analysis of the Robot Structure

From the provided information and forward kinematics tests, I can observe:

1. All three joints are revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis
2. The robot has a serial chain configuration
3. The link lengths and offsets are:
   - Link 1: Position [0, 0, 0]
   - Link 2: Position [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to Link 1
   - Link 3: Position [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to Link 2
   - TCP: Position [0, 0.093, 0] relative to Link 3

## Deriving the Inverse Kinematics Solution

Let me complete the inverse_kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position coordinates
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_link2 = -0.1197
    z_offset_link2 = 0.425
    z_offset_link3 = 0.39225
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # We need to find the position of the last joint, not the TCP
    # The TCP is offset by y_offset_tcp in the y direction from the last joint
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle in the XZ plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # The robot arm lies in a plane rotated by theta1 around the Y-axis
    # Project the target point onto this plane to solve for the other angles
    
    # Distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Account for the y-offset of the TCP
    # We need to adjust the y-coordinate based on the orientation
    y_adj = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by the arm
    # with distances r_xz and y_adj
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base of link 2 to the target point
    # (accounting for the y-offset of link 2)
    y_from_link2 = y_adj - y_offset_link2
    
    # Distance from link 2 base to target
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_from_link2**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    # We have a triangle with sides: z_offset_link3, d, and z_offset_link2
    cos_theta3 = (r_xz**2 + y_from_link2**2 - z_offset_link2**2 - z_offset_link3**2) / (2 * z_offset_link2 * z_offset_link3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (internal angle of the elbow)
    # We need to negate this because the joint rotates in the opposite direction
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now calculate theta2 using the law of sines
    # First, find the angle between the link 2 and the line to the target
    beta = np.arctan2(y_from_link2, r_xz)
    
    # Then find the angle in the triangle using the law of sines
    sin_alpha = z_offset_link3 * np.sin(-theta3) / d
    sin_alpha = np.clip(sin_alpha, -1.0, 1.0)
    alpha = np.arcsin(sin_alpha)
    
    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.0267, 0.81725]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57 (90Â°), the TCP moves to [0.8172, -0.0267, 0.0006], showing rotation around Y
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP is at [0.3922, -0.0267, 0.4253]
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP remains at [0, -0.0267, 0.81725]

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position coordinates
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_link2 = -0.1197
    z_offset_link2 = 0.425
    z_offset_link3 = 0.39225
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # Since all joints rotate around Y, the TCP offset is always in the local y direction
    y_adj = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation in the XZ plane)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by the arm
    # with distances r_xz and y_adj
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base of link 2 to the target point
    # (accounting for the y-offset of link 2)
    y_from_link2 = y_adj - y_offset_link2
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve the 2D inverse kinematics
    # in the plane defined by r_xz and y_from_link2
    
    # Length of link 2 and link 3
    L2 = z_offset_link2
    L3 = z_offset_link3
    
    # Distance from link 2 base to target
    D = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_from_link2**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle between the horizontal and the line to the target
    phi = np.arctan2(y_from_link2, r_xz)
    
    # Then find the angle between link 2 and the line to the target using the law of cosines
    cos_alpha = (L2**2 + D**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * D)
    cos_alpha = np.clip(cos_alpha, -1.0, 1.0)
    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to make one more correction. Based on the forward kinematics tests, I notice that the joint angles work differently than I initially thought. Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position coordinates
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    y_offset_link2 = -0.1197
    z_offset_link2 = 0.425
    z_offset_link3 = 0.39225
    y_offset_tcp = 0.093
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    y_adj = y + y_offset_link2 - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation in the XZ plane)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Distance from origin to target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve the 2D inverse kinematics
    # in the plane defined by r_xz and y_adj
    
    # Length of link 2 and link 3
    L2 = z_offset_link2
    L3 = z_offset_link3
    
    # Distance from origin to target in the plane
    D = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle between the horizontal and the line to the target
    phi = np.arctan2(y_adj, r_xz)
    
    # Then find the angle between link 2 and the line to the target using the law of cosines
    cos_alpha = (L2**2 + D**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * D)

    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the forward kinematics tests, I need to make one final correction to my solution:

    # Rotate the target point back to the YZ plane
    # This simplifies the problem to a 2D inverse kinematics in the YZ plane
    x_rot = x * np.cos(-theta1) - z * np.sin(-theta1)
    y_rot = y
    z_rot = x * np.sin(-theta1) + z * np.cos(-theta1)

    y_rot = y_rot - y_offset_tcp
