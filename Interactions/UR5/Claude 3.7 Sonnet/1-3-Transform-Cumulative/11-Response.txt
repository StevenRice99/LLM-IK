Based on the feedback, I can see that my solution is not correctly handling the inverse kinematics for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the failed cases and develop a more accurate solution.

Looking at the correct joint values provided in the feedback, I notice that:
1. All three joints are being used (not just joints 1 and 2)
2. The relationship between target position/orientation and joint angles is more complex than I initially thought

Let me develop a complete solution:

```python
