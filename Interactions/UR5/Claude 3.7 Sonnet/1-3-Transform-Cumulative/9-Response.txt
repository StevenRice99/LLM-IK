Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I observe:
1. All three joints are revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis
2. The TCP position depends on all three joint angles
3. The TCP orientation is determined by the sum of all joint angles

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

I need to revise this solution again. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.0267, 0.81725]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57, the TCP rotates around the Y-axis
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP moves to [0.3922, -0.0267, 0.4253]
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57, only the orientation changes, not the position
