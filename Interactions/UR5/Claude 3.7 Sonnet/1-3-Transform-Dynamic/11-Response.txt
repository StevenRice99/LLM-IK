Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis (revolute joints)
2. The TCP position changes based on the joint angles
3. The robot has a serial chain structure with specific link dimensions

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p

    l1_y = -0.1197
    l2_z = 0.39225
    tcp_y = 0.093
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This rotates the arm in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for joint 1 rotation
    # We need to work in the plane of joints 2 and 3
    x_rot = x * math.cos(-theta1) - z * math.sin(-theta1)
    z_rot = x * math.sin(-theta1) + z * math.cos(-theta1)
    
    # The y-coordinate of the TCP in the local frame
    y_local = y - l1_y - tcp_y

    # Calculate the total length from joint 2 to the TCP in the YZ plane
    L = math.sqrt(y_local**2 + z_local**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (L**2 - l2_z**2 - tcp_y**2) / (2 * l2_z * tcp_y)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.pi - math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # First, find the angle of the line from joint 2 to the target point
    phi = math.atan2(y_local, z_local)
    
    # Then find the angle in the triangle formed by joint 2, joint 3, and the target
    cos_alpha = (l2_z**2 + L**2 - tcp_y**2) / (2 * l2_z * L)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is the difference between these angles
    theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    # Adjust joint 3 based on the desired orientation
    # The final orientation is the sum of all joint angles
    # So theta3 needs to be adjusted to achieve the desired orientation ry
    theta3_adjusted = ry - theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3_adjusted)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Looking at the existing code and the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. From EXISTING 1, joint 1 is calculated using atan2(x, z)
2. From EXISTING 2, there's a special case for orientation handling
3. The forward kinematics tests show that the joints all rotate around the Y-axis

Let me revise the solution:

    # Using law of cosines to find joint 3 angle

    current_sum = theta1 + theta2 + theta3
    theta3_adjusted = theta3 + (desired_sum - current_sum)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3_adjusted)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Let me simplify and correct the approach:

```

After careful analysis, I need to make one more correction to account for the specific geometry of this robot:

    # We need to find the position of joint 3 to solve for theta2
    # Joint 3 position depends on theta3, which depends on theta2
