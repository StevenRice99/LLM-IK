Thank you for the feedback. I see that my inverse kinematics solution has significant errors. Let me analyze the failures and develop a corrected solution.

The main issues appear to be:

1. Incorrect handling of the orientation parameters - I need to properly account for the full orientation vector
2. Problems with the wrist center calculation
3. Issues with the joint angle calculations using the law of cosines and sines

Let me revise my solution:
