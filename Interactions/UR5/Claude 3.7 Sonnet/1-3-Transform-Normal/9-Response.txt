Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the solution step by step.

From the tests, I can see that:
1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis (pitch joints)
2. The robot has a serial chain configuration
3. The TCP position changes based on the joint angles

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    d1 = -0.1197  # Y-offset of link 1
    d3 = 0.093  # Y-offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset in the y-direction, we need to account for this
    # based on the desired orientation
    
    # The orientation r[1] represents rotation around y-axis
    # For this robot, joint 1 controls the overall orientation around Y
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center (before TCP offset)
    # The wrist center is the position of joint 3 before considering the TCP offset
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Account for the y-offset of the TCP
    y_wrist = y - d3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the wrist center
    # This is in the plane of the arm (considering the offset d1)
    r_planar = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (y_wrist - d1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 2 and 3 angles
    cos_joint3 = (r_planar**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_joint3 = np.clip(cos_joint3, -1.0, 1.0)
    joint3 = -np.arccos(cos_joint3)  # Negative because of the robot's configuration
    
    # Calculate joint 2 using the law of sines
    beta = np.arctan2(y_wrist - d1, r_xz)
    gamma = np.arcsin(l2 * np.sin(-joint3) / r_planar)
    joint2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Adjust joint 3 to account for the desired orientation
    # The final orientation is the sum of all joint angles
    # r[1] is the desired pitch (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint3_adjusted = r[1] - joint1 - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3_adjusted)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are 0, the TCP is at [0, -0.0267, 0.81725]
2. When joint1 = 1.57, the TCP moves primarily in the X direction
3. When joint2 = 1.57, the TCP moves forward and down
4. When joint3 = 1.57, only the orientation changes, not the position

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    d1 = -0.1197  # Y-offset of link 1
    d3 = 0.093  # Y-offset of TCP from link 3
    
    # Joint 1 controls the rotation in the XZ plane
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust for the TCP offset in the y-direction
    # The TCP offset is in the local y-direction of the end effector
    # When joint1 rotates, this offset affects both y and r_xz
    y_wrist = y
    if abs(joint1) > 1e-6:  # If joint1 is not close to zero
        # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
        y_wrist = y - d3 * np.cos(joint1)
        r_xz = r_xz - d3 * np.sin(joint1)
    else:
        # If joint1 is close to zero, the offset is primarily in the y-direction
        y_wrist = y - d3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the wrist center
    r_planar = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (y_wrist - d1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_joint3 = (r_planar**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_joint3 = np.clip(cos_joint3, -1.0, 1.0)
    joint3 = -np.arccos(cos_joint3)  # Negative because of the robot's configuration
    
    # Calculate joint 2 using the law of sines and atan2
    beta = np.arctan2(y_wrist - d1, r_xz)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(-joint3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(-joint3))
    joint2 = beta - gamma
    
    # The desired orientation r[1] (pitch) is the sum of all joint angles
    # So we need to adjust joint3 to achieve the desired orientation
    desired_pitch = r[1]
    joint3_adjusted = desired_pitch - joint1 - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3_adjusted)
```

After further analysis, I need to make one more revision to correctly handle the kinematics:

    wrist_r_xz = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 1 to the wrist center
    r_planar = np.sqrt(wrist_r_xz**2 + (wrist_y - d1)**2)

    beta = np.arctan2(wrist_y - d1, wrist_r_xz)
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(-joint3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(-joint3))
    joint2 = beta - gamma
    
    # The final orientation is determined by the sum of all joint angles
    # Adjust joint3 to achieve the desired orientation
    joint3_adjusted = ee_orientation - joint1 - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3_adjusted)
```

After careful analysis of the forward kinematics tests and the robot structure, I need to simplify my approach. Let me provide the final solution:
