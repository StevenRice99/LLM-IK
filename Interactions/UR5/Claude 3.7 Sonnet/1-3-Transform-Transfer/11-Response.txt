I see the pattern now. After analyzing the failed cases and the correct joint values, I understand that the relationship between orientation and joint angles is more complex than I initially thought.

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    
    # Check if we need to use the alternate solution based on orientation
    wrist_flip = (abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 0.1 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 0.1)
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target (in xz plane)
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate initial theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Looking at the correct solutions, I notice that when wrist_flip is true,
    # we need to use a different approach to calculate the joint angles
    if wrist_flip:
        # For the first failed case: [-1.773872596070412, -1.938332954521114, 0.88111551357715]
        # The target position is [-0.204393550156433, -0.0267, -0.41582128041589]
        # and orientation is [3.141592653589793, -0.310502616575417, 3.141592653589793]
        
        # For positions with negative z, we need a different approach
        if z_adj < 0:
            theta1 = alpha - beta
            # Keep theta2 positive for this case
            theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2
        else:
            # For positions with positive z
            theta1 = alpha - beta + math.pi
            theta2 = -theta2
            theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2
    else:
        # Standard approach for non-flipped wrist
        theta1 = alpha - beta
        theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2
    
    # Normalize all angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta3 = ((theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis, I see that my approach is still not capturing the correct relationship. Let me try a completely different approach based on the correct joint values provided:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    
    # Check if we need to use the alternate solution based on orientation
    wrist_flip = (abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 0.1 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 0.1)
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target (in xz plane)
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate initial theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # For wrist_flip configuration, we need to adjust our approach
    if wrist_flip:
        # Based on the correct solutions, when wrist_flip is true,
        # we need to adjust theta1 and possibly flip theta2
        
        # If theta1 is in the first or fourth quadrant, we need to adjust it
        if abs(theta1) < math.pi/2:
            theta1 += math.pi
            theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta3 based on the desired orientation
    theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2
    
    # Normalize all angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    theta3 = ((theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful analysis of the failed cases and the correct joint values, I need to make one final revision:

```python

    z_adj = z
    
    # Check if we need to use the alternate solution based on orientation

        if abs(alpha) < math.pi/2:
