I'll analyze the forward kinematics results to develop the inverse kinematics solution for both position and orientation. Let me work through this step by step.

First, I need to understand how the joint angles affect both position and orientation based on the provided forward kinematics results.

From the results, I can see:
- All joints rotate around the Y-axis (as specified in the details)
- The orientation values show that each joint contributes to the final orientation
- Joint 1 has orientation [0, 0.5, 0]
- Joint 2 has orientation [0, 0.8, 0]
- Joint 3 has orientation [0, 1.0, 0]

This suggests that the orientation components are additive, and the final orientation is the sum of all joint angles.

Let me now develop the complete inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target (in xz plane)
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3 based on the target orientation
    # Since all joints rotate around Y-axis, we only care about ry
    # The final orientation is the sum of all joint angles
    # So: ry = theta1 + theta2 + theta3
    theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution:
1. First solves for the position using the same approach as the existing solution
2. Then calculates theta3 based on the target orientation, knowing that the final orientation is the sum of all joint angles

The key insight is that for a robot with all joints rotating around the same axis (Y in this case), the final orientation around that axis is simply the sum of all joint angles. So we can solve for the first two joints based on position, and then determine the third joint angle to achieve the desired orientation.
