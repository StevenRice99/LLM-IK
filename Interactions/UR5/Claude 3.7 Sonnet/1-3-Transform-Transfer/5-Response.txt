I see the issue now. The main problem is that I didn't properly account for the orientation representation. Looking at the failed cases, I notice that the target orientations include values like [π, y, π] while my solution only considered the y component.

Let me revise the inverse kinematics solution to properly handle the orientation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target (in xz plane)
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine if we need the elbow up or down configuration
    # We need to check if we're in the correct configuration based on the target orientation
    # If rx and rz are both π, we need to flip the arm configuration
    flip_configuration = (abs(rx) > math.pi/2 and abs(rz) > math.pi/2)
    
    if flip_configuration:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    if flip_configuration:
        theta1 = alpha - beta + math.pi
    else:
        theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Normalize theta1 to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    # Calculate theta3 based on the target orientation
    # For orientation [π, y, π], we need to adjust our approach
    if flip_configuration:
        theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2 + math.pi
    else:
        theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2
    
    # Normalize theta3 to be within [-π, π]
    theta3 = ((theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. The feedback shows that my understanding of the orientation representation is incorrect. Let me analyze the failed cases more carefully.

Looking at the correct joint values and the corresponding orientations, I notice that when the target orientation has rx and rz equal to π, the solution often involves joint angles that sum differently than I expected.

Let me revise my approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    
    # Calculate distance from base to target (in xz plane)
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Check if we need to flip the elbow configuration
    # This is determined by whether rx and rz are both close to π
    flip_arm = (abs(abs(rx) - math.pi) < 0.1 and abs(abs(rz) - math.pi) < 0.1)
    
    # Calculate initial theta1 and determine if we need to flip the arm
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    if flip_arm:
        # For orientations with rx and rz near π, we need the opposite elbow configuration
        theta2 = -theta2
        theta1 = alpha - beta + math.pi
    else:
        # Standard configuration
        theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Normalize theta1 to be within [-π, π]
    theta1 = ((theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    # Calculate theta3 to achieve the desired orientation
    # The final orientation around Y is the sum of all joint angles
    theta3 = ry - theta1 - theta2
    
    # Normalize theta3 to be within [-π, π]
    theta3 = ((theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the failed cases, I see that my approach still isn't capturing the correct relationship. Let me make one more revision:

```python

    # Calculate theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    if use_alternate:
        # For the alternate solution, we use -theta2 and adjust theta1
        theta2 = -theta2
        if z_adj < 0:
            theta1 = alpha - beta
        else:
            theta1 = alpha - beta + math.pi
    else:
        # Standard solution
        if z_adj < 0:

    if use_alternate:

    else:

    theta3 = ((theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful analysis of the failed cases, I need to take a different approach. Let me provide a final solution:
