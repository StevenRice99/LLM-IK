I see that my solution is still not working correctly. After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I notice that there are specific patterns in the correct joint values. Let me revise my approach completely.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice:
1. For some targets, theta2 is positive, and for others, it's negative
2. The sign of theta3 often (but not always) opposes the sign of theta2
3. There seems to be a relationship between the target position and the configuration chosen

Let me implement a more robust solution:
