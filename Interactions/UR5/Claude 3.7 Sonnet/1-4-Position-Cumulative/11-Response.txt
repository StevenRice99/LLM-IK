Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values compared to my solution and develop a better approach.

The main issues appear to be:

1. I didn't properly account for the orientation of the robot's links
2. I made incorrect assumptions about the relationship between joint angles and the TCP position
3. The approach of setting joint4 to 0 isn't working correctly

Let me develop a new solution based on the correct joint values provided:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    y_offset_joint4 = 0.093
    z_offset_tcp = 0.09465
    
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (joint 1 to joint 2)
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    
    # For this robot configuration, we'll set joint4 = 0 as it appears to be the case in the examples
    joint4 = 0.0
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 4 by working backwards from the TCP
    # When joint4 = 0, the TCP offset is in the direction determined by joint1
    # First, we need to determine joint1
    
    # The projection of the arm on the x-z plane gives us joint1
    # However, we need to account for the TCP offset
    
    # Calculate the wrist position (joint 4) by subtracting the TCP offset
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y
    wrist_z = z - z_offset_tcp  # Assuming TCP offset is primarily in z direction when joint4=0
    
    # Joint 1 determines the plane in which the arm operates
    joint1 = np.arctan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the x-z plane to the wrist
    r_xz = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Adjust y for the offset at joint 2 and joint 4
    y_adjusted = wrist_y - y_offset_joint2 - y_offset_joint4
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the wrist position
    r = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_adjusted**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_joint3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_joint3 = np.clip(cos_joint3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # Joint 3 can be positive or negative depending on the elbow configuration
    # Based on the examples, we need to determine the correct sign
    joint3_pos = np.arccos(cos_joint3)
    joint3_neg = -np.arccos(cos_joint3)
    
    # Calculate joint2 for both possible joint3 values
    beta = np.arctan2(y_adjusted, r_xz)
    
    # For positive joint3
    alpha_pos = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint3_pos), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint3_pos))
    joint2_pos = beta - alpha_pos
    
    # For negative joint3
    alpha_neg = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint3_neg), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint3_neg))
    joint2_neg = beta - alpha_neg
    
    # Choose the configuration that best matches the examples
    # This is a heuristic based on the provided correct values
    # We'll choose the configuration where joint2 and joint3 have opposite signs
    if (joint2_pos * joint3_pos < 0):
        joint2 = joint2_pos
        joint3 = joint3_pos
    else:
        joint2 = joint2_neg
        joint3 = joint3_neg
    
    # Additional check: if target is below the base, we might need to flip joint1
    if z < 0 and abs(joint1) < np.pi/2:
        # Adjust joint1 to point in the opposite direction
        if joint1 > 0:
            joint1 -= np.pi
        else:
            joint1 += np.pi
        
        # Recalculate joint2 and joint3 for this configuration
        beta = np.arctan2(y_adjusted, r_xz)
        alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint3))
        joint2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. Looking at the examples more carefully, I see that the relationship between joint angles and target position is more complex than I initially thought.

Let me revise the solution:
