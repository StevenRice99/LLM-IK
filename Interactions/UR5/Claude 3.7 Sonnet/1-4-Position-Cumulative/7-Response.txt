Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure:

1. The robot has 4 revolute joints, with the first 3 rotating around the Y-axis and the 4th around the Z-axis
2. The TCP (end effector) is offset from the 4th joint
3. The link lengths and offsets are important for calculating joint angles

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets from the DETAILS table
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    L3_y = 0.093    # Y-offset of link 3
    L4_z = 0.09465  # Z-offset of TCP from joint 4
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 4
    # Since joint 4 rotates around Z-axis, the TCP offset is in the XZ plane
    # We need to solve for joint 4 position first, then work backwards
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4
    # For joint 4, we need to account for its orientation which depends on the first 3 joints
    
    # First, solve for joint 4 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint only affects the orientation, not the position in our case
    # Since we're only solving for position, we can set theta4 to any value (e.g., 0)
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Now we need to solve for the position of joint 4
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by L4_z in the local z-direction
    # We need to work backwards to find where joint 4 should be
    
    # Since the first 3 joints rotate around Y-axis, they create a plane
    # The projection of the end effector onto the XZ plane gives us the direction
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # If the target is directly above/below the base, handle the special case
    if r_xz < 1e-6:
        theta1 = 0.0  # Any value would work, choose 0
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to solve for theta2 and theta3
    # We'll use the approach from EXISTING 3, but adjust for our full chain
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset and the offset of joint 4
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by L4_z in the local z-direction after all rotations
    # Joint 4 is offset from joint 3 by L3_y in the y-direction
    
    # For simplicity, we'll solve for the position of joint 3, then use that to find theta2 and theta3
    # Joint 3 is at the position of joint 4 minus the y-offset of L3_y
    y_adj = y - L3_y
    
    # Now we have a 3-link planar manipulator problem (joints 1, 2, 3)
    # We can use the law of cosines to solve for theta2 and theta3
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the adjusted target in the XZ plane
    d_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the total distance from the base to the adjusted target
    d = math.sqrt(d_xz**2 + (y_adj - y_offset)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the target position
    # If the target is below the XZ plane, theta2 should be negative
    if y_adj < y_offset:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the total angle to the target
    # First, find the angle from the base to the target
    alpha = math.atan2(d_xz, y_adj - y_offset)
    
    # Then find the angle from the first link to the line from base to target
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = alpha - beta - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. The first 3 joints rotate around the Y-axis, creating a planar manipulator in the XZ plane
2. The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis, which affects the orientation but not the position in the XZ plane
3. The TCP is offset from the 4th joint by L4_z in the Z-direction

Let me revise my solution:

```python

    # First, determine theta1 (rotation around Y-axis for joint 1)
    # This determines the plane in which the arm operates
    if abs(x) < 1e-6 and abs(z) < 1e-6:
        theta1 = 0.0  # Special case: target directly above/below base
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to solve for the position of joint 4

    joint4_y = y
    
    # Now we have a 3-link planar manipulator problem (joints 1, 2, 3)

    # Calculate the total distance from joint 1 to joint 3
    d = math.sqrt(d_xz**2 + d_y**2)

    # For theta4, we need to determine the rotation around the Z-axis
    # Since we're only concerned with position, not orientation, we can set theta4 to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```
