Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure:

1. The robot has 4 revolute joints, with the first 3 rotating around the Y-axis and the last one around the Z-axis
2. The TCP (end effector) position is what we need to solve for
3. The existing solutions provide valuable insights for different subchains

Let me develop the complete solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    y_offset_joint4 = 0.093
    z_offset_tcp = 0.09465
    
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (joint 1 to joint 2)
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    l3 = z_offset_tcp  # Length of link 3 (joint 4 to TCP)
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 4 (before the last rotation)
    # Since joint 4 rotates around Z-axis, it only affects the x-y plane
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position
    
    # Since the last joint rotates around Z, we can't directly determine its angle
    # from the target position alone. We need to solve for the first 3 joints first.
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis and determines the x-z plane orientation
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the x-z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust y for the offset at joint 2
    y_target = y - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 to reach the position
    # This is a classic 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # We have a triangle with sides l1, l2, and the distance to the target
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the target in the y-r_xz plane
    r = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_target**2)
    
    # Account for the offset at joint 4 and TCP
    r_adjusted = np.sqrt((r_xz - l3 * np.cos(joint1))**2 + (y_target - y_offset_joint4)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_joint3 = (r_adjusted**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_joint3 = np.clip(cos_joint3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    joint3 = np.arccos(cos_joint3)
    
    # Find the angle for joint 2
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target - y_offset_joint4, r_xz - l3 * np.cos(joint1))
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint3))
    joint2 = beta - alpha
    
    # For joint 4, we need to determine the orientation
    # Since it rotates around Z, it doesn't affect the position
    # We can set it to 0 or any desired orientation
    joint4 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The forward kinematics tests show that joint 4 does affect the position of the TCP because the TCP has an offset from joint 4. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    y_offset_joint4 = 0.093
    z_offset_tcp = 0.09465
    
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (joint 1 to joint 2)
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    
    # Since joint 4 rotates around Z-axis, it affects the position in the x-z plane
    # when the TCP offset is considered
    
    # First, determine joint 1 which controls the orientation in the x-z plane
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the x-z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For a 4-DOF robot with this configuration, we have redundancy
    # We can set joint 4 to 0 and solve for the other joints
    joint4 = 0.0
    
    # With joint 4 = 0, the TCP offset is only in the z direction
    # We need to account for this offset when calculating the target for joints 2 and 3
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # When joint 4 = 0, the TCP offset is along the same direction as the last link
    x_adjusted = x - z_offset_tcp * np.sin(joint1)
    z_adjusted = z - z_offset_tcp * np.cos(joint1)
    r_xz_adjusted = np.sqrt(x_adjusted**2 + z_adjusted**2)
    
    # Adjust y for the offset at joint 2 and joint 4
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset_joint2 - y_offset_joint4
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 to reach the adjusted position
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the adjusted target
    r = np.sqrt(r_xz_adjusted**2 + y_adjusted**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_joint3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_joint3 = np.clip(cos_joint3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    joint3 = np.arccos(cos_joint3)
    
    # Find the angle for joint 2
    beta = np.arctan2(y_adjusted, r_xz_adjusted)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint3))
    joint2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

After further analysis of the forward kinematics tests, I need to make one more revision to correctly handle the TCP offset:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters
    y_offset_joint2 = -0.1197
    y_offset_joint4 = 0.093
    z_offset_tcp = 0.09465
    
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (joint 1 to joint 2)
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (joint 2 to joint 3)
    
    # Joint 1 determines the plane in which the arm operates
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 4 (before the TCP offset)
    # Since we have redundancy (4 DOF for a 3D position), we can set joint4 = 0
    joint4 = 0.0
    
    # With joint4 = 0, the TCP offset is only in the z direction of the last link's frame
    # We need to work backwards to find where joint 4 should be
    
    # Calculate the distance in the x-z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # When joint4 = 0, the TCP offset is along the direction determined by joint1
    x_joint4 = x - z_offset_tcp * np.sin(joint1)
    z_joint4 = z - z_offset_tcp * np.cos(joint1)
    r_xz_joint4 = np.sqrt(x_joint4**2 + z_joint4**2)
    
    # Adjust y for the offset at joint 2 and joint 4
    y_joint4 = y - y_offset_joint4
    y_adjusted = y_joint4 - y_offset_joint2
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 to reach the joint 4 position
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to joint 4
    r = np.sqrt(r_xz_joint4**2 + y_adjusted**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_joint3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_joint3 = np.clip(cos_joint3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    joint3 = np.arccos(cos_joint3)
    
    # Find the angle for joint 2
    beta = np.arctan2(y_adjusted, r_xz_joint4)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint3))
    joint2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

This solution should correctly handle the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator. I've set joint4 to 0 since we have redundancy (4 DOF for a 3D position), but this could be set to any desired value depending on the application requirements.
