Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values compared to my solution and fix the inverse kinematics function.

The main issues appear to be:
1. The calculation of joint positions when working backwards from the TCP
2. The handling of different arm configurations (elbow up vs elbow down)
3. The sign conventions for the joint angles

Let me revise the solution:

```python

    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # Since the TCP is offset from joint 4 by L4_z in the z-direction
    # and joint 4 is offset from joint 3 by L3_y in the y-direction
    # We need to work backwards to find the position of joint 3
    
    # First, determine theta1 (rotation around Y-axis for joint 1)

    wrist_z = z - L4_z * math.cos(theta1)
    wrist_y = y
    
    # Now calculate the position of joint 3 (elbow)
    # Joint 3 is offset from joint 4 by L3_y in the y-direction
    elbow_x = wrist_x
    elbow_y = wrist_y - L3_y

    # Total distance
    d = math.sqrt(d_xz**2 + dy**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos

    # Calculate theta3 for both configurations
    theta3_pos = phi - alpha_pos - theta2_pos
    theta3_neg = phi - alpha_neg - theta2_neg
    
    # Choose the configuration that best matches the examples
    # Based on the feedback, it seems we need to choose the configuration
    # that gives a theta3 value closer to 0 or positive
    if abs(theta3_pos) <= abs(theta3_neg):
        theta2 = theta2_pos
        theta3 = theta3_pos
    else:
        theta2 = theta2_neg
        theta3 = theta3_neg
    
    # For theta4, we can set it to 0 since we're only concerned with position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Looking at the correct joint values in the feedback, I see that there's a pattern in how the configurations are chosen. Let me revise the solution:
