Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure:

1. The robot has 4 revolute joints with the first 3 rotating around the Y-axis and the last one around the Z-axis
2. The TCP (end effector) is at a fixed offset from the last joint
3. The robot forms a planar manipulator for the first 3 joints, with the 4th joint adding a rotation around Z

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.093      # Offset in y-direction for link 3
    l4 = 0.09465    # Length of TCP from joint 4 (z-direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # First, determine joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the plane in which the arm operates
    if np.abs(x) < 1e-6 and np.abs(z) < 1e-6:
        # Special case: target is along the Y-axis
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target point onto the plane defined by theta1
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    
    # Adjust y for the offset of joint 2
    y_adj = y - y_offset
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve a 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # in the plane defined by theta1
    
    # The effective target for the 2-link planar part is the target minus the TCP offset
    # rotated back to the plane
    r_eff = r - l4 * np.sin(theta1)
    y_eff = y_adj - l3
    
    # Now solve the 2-link planar problem
    d = np.sqrt(r_eff**2 + y_eff**2)  # Distance to the effective target
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    # (We're told to assume all targets are reachable, but this is a good check)
    d = np.clip(d, 0, l1 + l2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find theta2 using the angle to the target and the interior angle
    phi = np.arctan2(y_eff, r_eff)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(theta3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    # Joint 4 (rotation around Z-axis) doesn't affect the position
    # Since we're only solving for position, we can set it to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When joint 2 is at 1.57 (90 degrees), the arm extends in the X direction
2. When joint 3 is at 1.57, there's an extension in the X direction as well
3. Joint 4 rotates around Z but doesn't change the TCP position

Let me revise the solution:
