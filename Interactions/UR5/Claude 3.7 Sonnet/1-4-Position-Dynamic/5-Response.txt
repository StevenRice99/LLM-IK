Thank you for providing the forward kinematics test results. Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 4-DOF serial manipulator based on the given information and existing code.

Let me analyze the robot structure:
- 4 revolute joints: first 3 rotate around Y-axis, last one around Z-axis
- The TCP (end effector) position is what we need to solve for

I'll now complete the inverse kinematics function by combining and extending the existing solutions:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths from the table
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (from joint 1 to joint 2)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (from joint 2 to joint 3)
    L3 = 0.093      # Length of link 3 (from joint 3 to joint 4)
    L4 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (from joint 4 to TCP)
    
    # Offset in y-direction for joint 2
    y_offset = -0.1197
    
    # First, we need to account for the last joint (joint 4) which rotates around Z-axis
    # and the TCP offset to find the position of joint 4
    # Since joint 4 rotates around Z, it affects x and y but not z
    # We need to solve for the position of joint 4 first
    
    # The distance from joint 4 to TCP in the xy-plane
    xy_dist = L4
    
    # We need to find the angle of joint 4 (theta4)
    # For a Z-axis rotation joint, we can determine theta4 from the xy-plane projection
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Now calculate the position of joint 4
    j4_x = x - L4 * math.sin(theta4)
    j4_z = z - L4 * math.cos(theta4)
    j4_y = y
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 1-3 to reach the position of joint 4
    # This is similar to the existing solution 1, but with the target being joint 4
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2
    j4_y_adjusted = j4_y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the planar distance in the xz-plane for the first 3 joints
    d = math.sqrt(j4_x**2 + j4_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the effective length of the third link (including the offset in y)
    L3_effective = math.sqrt(L3**2 + j4_y_adjusted**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    cross_product = j4_x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - j4_z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(j4_x, j4_z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # The angle theta3 needs to orient the end of link 3 to point toward joint 4
    # We can calculate this based on the relative positions
    
    # Position of joint 3
    j3_x = L1 * math.sin(theta1) + L2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    j3_z = L1 * math.cos(theta1) + L2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Vector from joint 3 to joint 4
    v_j3_j4_x = j4_x - j3_x
    v_j3_j4_z = j4_z - j3_z
    
    # Calculate theta3 as the angle needed to align with this vector
    theta3 = math.atan2(v_j3_j4_x, v_j3_j4_z) - (theta1 + theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. All joints 1-3 rotate around the Y-axis
2. Joint 4 rotates around the Z-axis
3. The TCP is offset from joint 4 by [0, 0, 0.09465]

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

    L4 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (from joint 4 to TCP)
    
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 4
    # Since the TCP is offset in the z-direction from joint 4
    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y
    j4_z = z - L4
    
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z-axis, which affects the orientation but not the position
    # of the TCP in this case. We'll determine theta4 later.
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 1-3 to reach the position of joint 4
    
    # Calculate the projection of joint 4 position onto the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(j4_x**2 + j4_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 (before joint 4's y-offset)
    j3_x = j4_x
    j3_y = j4_y - L3
    j3_z = j4_z
    
    # Now solve for joints 1 and 2 to reach joint 3
    # This is similar to the existing solution 1
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2

    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # For a Y-axis rotation joint, theta3 affects the position in the XZ plane

    # Since this is the last joint and rotates around Z, it doesn't affect the position
    # We can set it to any value, typically 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully and revise:

```python

I need to refine this solution further. Let me complete the inverse kinematics function correctly:
