Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct solutions, I notice:
1. Joint 3 (theta3) is not always 0 as I incorrectly assumed
2. Joint 4 (theta4) is consistently 0 in the correct solutions
3. My approach to calculating theta1 and theta2 needs refinement

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
import math

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link parameters from the table
    L1 = 0.425      # Z-offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.39225    # Z-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3_y = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    L4_z = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Since joint 4 rotates around Z-axis and doesn't affect the position (as seen in the correct solutions),
    # we'll set theta4 = 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 4

    # We need to solve for the first three joints to reach the position of joint 3
    # First, we'll solve for a 2-link manipulator (joints 1 and 2) to reach a point in the XZ plane
    # Then we'll calculate joint 3 to account for the final position
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the projection of joint 3 in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(j3_x**2 + j3_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the y-distance that needs to be covered by the first two links
    y_to_cover = j3_y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the 3D distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    # This is the effective length that needs to be covered by link 2
    L2_effective = math.sqrt(L2**2 + y_to_cover**2)

    phi = math.atan2(y_to_cover, L2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 1 and 2 in the XZ plane
    cos_alpha = (r_xz**2 + L1**2 - L2_effective**2) / (2 * r_xz * L1)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate theta1 (angle of joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_x, j3_z)
    if j3_x < 0 and j3_z < 0:
        theta1 -= alpha
    else:
        theta1 += alpha

    if j3_y > y_offset:
        theta2 = math.pi - beta - phi
    else:
        theta2 = math.pi - beta + phi
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)
    # This is the angle needed to align joint 3 with joint 4
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Y-axis, it affects the position in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 after applying theta1 and theta2
    j3_calc_x = L1 * math.sin(theta1) + L2 * math.cos(phi) * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    j3_calc_z = L1 * math.cos(theta1) + L2 * math.cos(phi) * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle needed to align with joint 4
    theta3 = math.atan2(j4_x - j3_calc_x, j4_z - j3_calc_z) - (theta1 + theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. The first 3 joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis
3. The TCP is offset from joint 4 by [0, 0, 0.09465]

Let me revise my solution:

    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Based on the correct solutions, joint 4 (theta4) is always 0
    theta4 = 0.0

    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y
    j4_z = z - L4_z
    
    # We need to solve for the first three joints to reach the position of joint 4
    
    # First, let's solve for a virtual target that would place joint 3 such that

    # Calculate the projection of the virtual target onto the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(virtual_x**2 + virtual_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the y-distance that needs to be covered
    y_to_cover = virtual_y - y_offset

    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos

    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
