I see that my solution is still not working correctly. Let me carefully analyze the feedback and the correct joint values again.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I notice that there's a fundamental issue with how I'm calculating the joint angles. Let me try a completely different approach based on the existing solution and the feedback.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (Z offset of joint 2)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (Z offset of joint 3)
    L3_y = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 4 from joint 3
    L4_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP from joint 4
    joint2_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    
    # Joint 4 is consistently 0 in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset from joint 4
    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y
    j4_z = z - L4_z
    
    # Now adjust for the offset of joint 3 from joint 4
    j3_x = j4_x
    j3_y = j4_y + L3_y
    j3_z = j4_z
    
    # Calculate theta1 - the angle of joint 1 around the Y axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_x, j3_z)
    
    # Transform the target position to the plane of the manipulator
    # This is the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(j3_x**2 + j3_z**2)
    
    # Adjust for the Y offset of joint 2
    j3_y_rel = j3_y - joint2_y
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by r and j3_y_rel
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 1 and 2
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + j3_y_rel**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > L1 + L2:
        # Target is too far, use the maximum extension
        d = L1 + L2
    
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2_internal = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the first link relative to the vertical
    cos_alpha = (L1**2 + d**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * d)
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the target relative to the vertical
    phi = math.atan2(j3_y_rel, r)
    
    # Calculate theta2 based on the configuration
    # Looking at the correct solutions, we need to determine the sign of theta2
    # based on the position of the target
    if j3_y_rel >= 0:
        theta2 = phi + alpha
    else:
        theta2 = phi - alpha
    
    # Calculate theta3 based on the correct solutions
    # Looking at the patterns, theta3 seems to be related to theta2_internal
    # with a sign that depends on the configuration
    if j3_y_rel >= 0:
        theta3 = -theta2_internal
    else:
        theta3 = theta2_internal
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Let me revise this solution one more time:
