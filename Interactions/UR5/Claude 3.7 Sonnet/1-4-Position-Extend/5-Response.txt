I'll analyze the forward kinematics results and develop a solution for the inverse kinematics problem. Let me work through this step by step.

From the provided information and forward kinematics tests, I can see that:

1. The robot has 4 revolute joints
2. The first 3 joints rotate around the Y-axis
3. The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis
4. The existing solution handles the first 3 joints, but needs to be extended for the 4th joint

Let's analyze the kinematics chain:

1. The first 3 joints form a planar manipulator in the XZ plane
2. The 4th joint introduces a rotation around the Z-axis, which affects the final TCP position
3. The TCP has an offset of 0.09465 in the Z direction from joint 4

The existing solution assumes joint 4 is the position being solved for, but we need to account for the TCP offset from joint 4 and the rotation of joint 4.

Here's my complete solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    L3_y = 0.093    # Y offset of link 3
    L4_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # First, determine joint 4 angle
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z-axis, affecting the X-Y position
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    xy_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the TCP offset in Z direction
    z_adj = z - L4_z
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 (before its rotation)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position
    j4_y = xy_dist - L3_y
    j4_z = z_adj
    
    # Now solve the planar manipulator (joints 1-3) to reach the joint 4 position
    d = math.sqrt(j4_y**2 + j4_z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    cross_product = j4_y * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - j4_z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the approach from the existing solution
    alpha = math.atan2(j4_y, j4_z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Joint 3 is set to 0 as in the existing solution
    theta3 = 0
    
    # Return all four joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me think more carefully about the kinematics chain.

Looking at the forward kinematics results, I notice that:
1. Joint 4 rotates around the Z-axis, which means it affects the X and Y coordinates
2. The TCP has an offset in the Z direction from joint 4

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    L3_y = 0.093    # Y offset of link 3
    L4_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 (before its rotation)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position
    xy_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Joint 4 angle is determined by the orientation in the XY plane
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the position that joints 1-3 need to reach
    # This is the position of joint 4 in the XZ plane
    j4_x = 0  # In the original XZ plane
    j4_y = xy_dist - L3_y  # Adjusted for the Y offset of link 3
    j4_z = z - L4_z  # Adjusted for the Z offset of the TCP
    
    # Now solve the planar manipulator (joints 1-3) to reach the joint 4 position
    d = math.sqrt(j4_y**2 + j4_z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    cross_product = j4_y * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - j4_z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the approach from the existing solution
    alpha = math.atan2(j4_y, j4_z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Joint 3 is set to 0 as in the existing solution
    theta3 = 0
    
    # Return all four joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results more carefully.

Based on the forward kinematics tests, I see that:
1. The first 3 joints rotate around the Y-axis, creating a planar manipulator in the XZ plane
2. The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis, which affects the final position in the XY plane
3. The TCP has an offset from joint 4

Let me complete the solution correctly:

```python
import math

    """

    # Calculate theta4 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Adjust for the TCP offset in Z direction
    z_adj = z - L4_z
    
    # Calculate the position that joints 1-3 need to reach
