Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback and revise my approach.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice:

1. Joint 3 is not always 0, which contradicts my assumption
2. Joint 4 is consistently 0 in the correct solutions, not the calculated value I was using
3. The relationship between the target position and joint angles is more complex than I initially thought

Let me revise my solution based on these observations:

```python
import math

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2
    L3_y = 0.093    # Y offset of link 3
    L4_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # From the feedback, joint 4 is consistently 0
    theta4 = 0
    
    # Since joint 4 is 0, we need to account for the offsets differently
    # The target is the TCP position, we need to work backwards to find joint positions
    
    # First, adjust for the TCP offset from joint 4
    # Since joint 4 is at 0, the TCP is directly above joint 4 in the Z direction
    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y
    j4_z = z - L4_z
    
    # Now adjust for the offset of joint 3 from the XZ plane
    # Joint 3 is offset in the Y direction by L3_y
    j3_x = j4_x
    j3_y = j4_y + L3_y  # Add because we're working backwards
    j3_z = j4_z
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 1, 2, and 3 to reach the position of joint 3
    # This is a 3-DOF planar manipulator problem
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    d_xz = math.sqrt(j3_x**2 + j3_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target in the YZ plane
    # This is what the first 3 joints (which rotate around Y) need to reach
    proj_y = j3_y
    proj_z = j3_z
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target in the XZ plane
    # This determines the rotation of joint 1 around the Y axis
    proj_x = j3_x
    
    # Calculate theta1 - the angle of joint 1 around the Y axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(proj_x, proj_z)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 in the plane defined by theta1
    # Calculate the distance in this plane
    d = math.sqrt(proj_y**2 + math.sqrt(proj_x**2 + proj_z**2)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the first link relative to the horizontal
    alpha = math.atan2(proj_y, math.sqrt(proj_x**2 + proj_z**2))
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the configuration
    if proj_y < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
        beta = -beta
    
    # Calculate theta3 to orient the end effector correctly
    theta3 = -(alpha - beta + theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the problem more carefully.

Looking at the robot description and the correct solutions:

1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis except joint 4, which rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 4 is consistently 0 in the correct solutions
3. The TCP has an offset from joint 4

Let me revise my solution:

```python

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it one more time based on a more careful analysis of the robot kinematics:
