I see that my solution is still not working correctly. Let me carefully analyze the feedback and the correct joint values to understand the pattern.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I notice:

1. Joint 4 is consistently 0, which I got right
2. The relationship between joints 1, 2, and 3 is more complex than I thought
3. There seems to be a pattern in how the angles relate to each other

Let me try a different approach based on the existing solution provided earlier:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (Z offset of joint 2)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (Z offset of joint 3)
    L3_y = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 4 from joint 3
    L4_z = 0.09465  # Z offset of TCP from joint 4
    joint2_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    
    # Joint 4 is consistently 0 in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset from joint 4
    # Since joint 4 is 0, the TCP is directly above joint 4 in the Z direction
    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y
    j4_z = z - L4_z
    
    # Now adjust for the offset of joint 3 from joint 4
    j3_x = j4_x
    j3_y = j4_y + L3_y  # Joint 3 is offset in -Y direction from joint 4
    j3_z = j4_z
    
    # Calculate the projection in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(j3_x**2 + j3_z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 - the angle of joint 1 around the Y axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_x, j3_z)
    
    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 1 to joint 3
    # We need to account for the Y offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    j3_y_rel = j3_y - joint2_y
    d = math.sqrt(j3_y_rel**2 + r**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 1 and 2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2_internal = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the target relative to the horizontal
    alpha = math.atan2(j3_y_rel, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2_internal), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2_internal))
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2_internal based on the cross product
    cross_product = r * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2_internal)) - j3_y_rel * (L2 * math.sin(theta2_internal))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2_internal = -theta2_internal
        beta = -beta
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # Based on the correct solutions, theta3 seems to be related to theta2_internal
    theta3 = -theta2_internal
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Let me revise this solution again. Looking at the correct joint values more carefully:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """

    L3_y = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 4 from joint 3

    joint2_y = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    
    # Joint 4 is consistently 0 in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset from joint 4
    # Since joint 4 is 0, the TCP is directly above joint 4 in the Z direction
    j4_x = x

    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    # We need to account for the Y offset of joint 2 from joint 1
    j3_y_rel = j3_y - joint2_y
    d = math.sqrt(j3_y_rel**2 + r**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 1 and 2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2_internal = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the target relative to the vertical
    alpha = math.atan2(r, j3_y_rel)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the first link and the line to the target
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2_internal), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2_internal))
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2_internal based on the configuration
    if j3_y_rel < 0:
        theta2_internal = -theta2_internal
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.pi/2 - alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = theta2_internal
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try one more approach based on the existing solution and the feedback:
