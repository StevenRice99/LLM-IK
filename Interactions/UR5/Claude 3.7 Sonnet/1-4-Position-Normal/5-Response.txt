I'll solve the inverse kinematics problem for this 4-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop a closed-form solution.

Based on the forward kinematics results, I can see that:
1. The first 3 joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis
3. The robot has a specific configuration with offsets between joints

Let me develop the solution step by step:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425       # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.39225     # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.093       # Offset in y-direction for joint 4
    l4 = 0.09465     # Length from joint 4 to TCP
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # First, we need to find the position of the wrist center (joint 4)
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by l4 in the z-direction
    # Since joint 4 rotates around the z-axis, we can work backwards from the TCP
    
    # For a target at [x, y, z], the wrist center is at:
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y
    wrist_z = z - l4
    
    # The first joint (theta1) rotates around the Y-axis and affects the x and z coordinates
    # Since the first joint is at the origin, we can compute theta1 directly
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wrist_x, wrist_z) if (wrist_x != 0 or wrist_z != 0) else 0
    
    # Now we need to find the distance from joint 1 to the wrist center in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset and the wrist y-position
    # The distance from joint 1 to the projection of the wrist on the XZ plane
    # needs to account for the y-offset of joint 2 and the y-position of the wrist
    y_diff = wrist_y - y_offset
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by the arm
    # We need to find theta2 and theta3 to reach the wrist position
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the wrist center, accounting for the y-offset of joint 3
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_diff**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines and the angle to the wrist
    # First, find the angle between l1 and d
    beta = np.arccos((l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d))
    
    # Then find the angle from the z-axis to d
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_diff, r)
    
    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    theta2 = alpha + beta
    
    # For theta4, we need to ensure the end effector is pointing in the right direction
    # Since the last joint rotates around the Z-axis, and we're only concerned with position,
    # we can set theta4 to 0 or any value that makes sense for the application
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

1. The first 3 joints rotate around the Y-axis, which means they affect the robot's position in the XZ plane
2. The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis, which affects orientation but not position

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table

    l2 = 0.39225     # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.093       # Offset in y-direction for joint 4
    l4 = 0.09465     # Length from joint 4 to TCP
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # First, we need to find the position of the wrist center (joint 4)
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by l4 in the z-direction
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y
    wrist_z = z - l4
    
    # The first joint (theta1) rotates around the Y-axis
    # This rotation determines how much of the arm's reach is in the X vs Z direction
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wrist_x, wrist_z) if (wrist_x != 0 or wrist_z != 0) else 0
    
    # Now we need to find the distance from joint 1 to the wrist center in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate needs special handling due to the offsets
    # The effective y-distance that joints 2 and 3 need to cover
    y_effective = wrist_y - y_offset - l3
    
    # The total distance from joint 2 to the wrist position
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_effective**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    # The negative value gives the "elbow up" configuration
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines and the angle to the wrist
    # First, find the angle between l1 and d
    beta = np.arccos((l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d))
    
    # Then find the angle from the horizontal to d
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_effective, r)
    
    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For theta4, we can set it to 0 since we're only concerned with position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

    # The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis and doesn't affect the position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After careful analysis, I need to make one more revision to ensure the solution is correct:
