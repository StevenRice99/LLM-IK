I see the issues with my previous solution. Let me analyze the feedback and develop a correct inverse kinematics solution. The key problems appear to be:

1. The approach to calculating joint angles is incorrect
2. There are issues with handling the robot's specific geometry
3. The solution doesn't account for different arm configurations

Let me develop a new solution based on the correct joint values provided in the feedback:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425       # Length from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225     # Length from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.093       # Offset in y-direction for joint 4
    l4 = 0.09465     # Length from joint 4 to TCP (z-direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position by subtracting the TCP offset
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y
    wrist_z = z - l4
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the wrist in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # Looking at the feedback, we need to handle the sign differently
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Now we need to work in the plane defined by the arm after rotation by theta1
    # We need to find the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    
    # First, calculate the effective height (along the arm) to the wrist
    # This is the distance from joint 2 to the wrist projected onto the arm's plane
    h = r_xz - l3 * np.sin(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the effective y-coordinate (perpendicular to the arm's plane)
    k = wrist_y - y_offset - l3 * np.cos(theta1)
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    d = np.sqrt(h**2 + k**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Based on the feedback, we need to determine the correct sign for theta3
    # Analyzing the examples, it seems we need to use the positive value
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle between l1 and d using the law of cosines
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_beta = np.clip(cos_beta, -1.0, 1.0)
    beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
    
    # Then find the angle from the vertical to d
    alpha = np.arctan2(k, h)
    
    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    # Based on the feedback, we need to adjust the calculation
    theta2 = alpha + beta
    
    # For theta4, we can set it to 0 since we're only concerned with position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully and revise my solution:

```python

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425       # Length from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)

    l3 = 0.093       # Offset in y-direction for joint 4
    l4 = 0.09465     # Length from joint 4 to TCP (z-direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # The TCP is at position [x, y, z]
    # We need to work backwards to find the wrist center
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the plane in which the arm operates
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position
    # The wrist center is offset from the TCP by l4 in the direction determined by theta1
    wrist_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta1)
    wrist_y = y
    wrist_z = z - l4 * np.cos(theta1)
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by theta1
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the wrist in this plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Account for the y-offset of joint 2
    y_effective = wrist_y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    d = np.sqrt((r - 0)**2 + (y_effective - 0)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Based on the feedback examples, theta3 can be positive or negative
    # We need to determine which configuration is correct
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle between l1 and d using the law of cosines
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_beta = np.clip(cos_beta, -1.0, 1.0)
    beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
    
    # Then find the angle from the horizontal to d
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_effective, r)
    
    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For theta4, we can set it to 0 since we're only concerned with position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I need to make one more revision:
