I see the issues with my previous solutions. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully and develop a correct inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values provided in the feedback, I notice several patterns:

1. The relationship between theta1 and the target position is more complex than I initially thought
2. The signs of theta2 and theta3 vary based on the target position
3. There seems to be a specific configuration preference for the robot arm

Let me develop a new solution based on this analysis:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425       # Length from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.39225     # Length from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.093       # Offset in y-direction for joint 4
    l4 = 0.09465     # Length from joint 4 to TCP (z-direction)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 4 (wrist center)
    # The TCP is at position [x, y, z]
    # Joint 4 is offset from the TCP by l4 in the z-direction
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y
    wrist_z = z - l4
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the wrist in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the plane in which the arm operates
    # Based on the feedback examples, we need to handle this differently
    
    # Analyzing the examples, I notice that theta1 is related to the target position
    # but not always in the way I initially calculated
    
    # Let's try a different approach based on the examples
    # For targets with positive x, theta1 is often close to atan2(x, z)
    # For targets with negative x, theta1 is often close to atan2(x, z) or atan2(x, z) - π
    
    # Let's calculate the basic theta1
    basic_theta1 = np.arctan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Now we need to determine if we should use this value or adjust it
    # Looking at the examples, I notice that when z is negative, theta1 often needs adjustment
    
    # Let's try a different approach
    # The first joint rotates around the Y-axis, which affects the x and z coordinates
    # We can calculate the angle directly
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to solve for theta2 and theta3
    # We have a 2D problem in the plane defined by theta1
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist in the plane of the arm
    # This is the distance from the origin to the wrist projected onto the arm's plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Account for the y-offset of joint 2
    y_effective = wrist_y - y_offset
    
    # We now have a 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # The two links are l1 and l2, and we need to reach the point (r, y_effective)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_effective**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > l1 + l2:
        # Target is too far away
        # Since we're told all targets are reachable, this shouldn't happen
        # But let's handle it gracefully
        d = l1 + l2 - 0.0001
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Based on the feedback examples, I need to determine the correct sign for theta3
    # Looking at the examples, I notice that theta3 is often positive when z is negative
    # and negative when z is positive
    
    # Let's try this heuristic
    if z < 0:
        theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    else:
        theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle between l1 and d using the law of cosines
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_beta = np.clip(cos_beta, -1.0, 1.0)
    beta = np.arccos(cos_beta)
    
    # Then find the angle from the horizontal to d
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_effective, r)
    
    # Theta2 is the combination of these angles
    # The sign depends on the configuration
    if z < 0:
        theta2 = alpha + beta
    else:
        theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For theta4, we can set it to 0 since we're only concerned with position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I need to revise my approach:
