Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see that:
1. All 4 joints are revolute
2. Joints 1, 2, and 3 rotate around the Y-axis
3. Joint 4 rotates around the Z-axis
4. The robot has a specific kinematic chain with offsets between joints

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Define rotation matrices
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([[1, 0, 0], 
                         [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_y(angle):

    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Account for the TCP offset (0, 0, 0.09465)
    # We need to find the position of the 4th joint
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0, 0.09465])
    
    # Rotate the TCP offset by the target orientation

    # Calculate the position of joint 4
    j4_pos = np.array([x, y, z]) - tcp_offset_rotated
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # For a Y-axis rotation, we use atan2(x, z)
    joint1 = math.atan2(j4_pos[0], j4_pos[2])
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 1
    R1 = rot_y(joint1)
    
    # Transform the problem to the frame after joint 1
    local_pos = R1.T @ j4_pos
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 in the local frame
    # Joint 2 is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # Joint 3 is at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725] relative to base
    # So joint 3 is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 2
    
    # Joint 4 is at [0, -0.0267, 0.81725] relative to base
    # So joint 4 is at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to joint 3

    x_local, y_local, z_local = local_pos
    
    # The planar problem in the YZ plane after joint 1 rotation
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator with:
    # Link 2 length: 0.39225
    # Link 3 length: 0.093
    # Target: (y_local, z_local) offset by (-0.1197, 0.425) from joint 2
    
    # Adjust target for joint 2 position
    y_target = y_local + 0.1197
    z_target = z_local - 0.425
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    dist = math.sqrt(y_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.093    # Length of link 3
    
    # Use cosine law to find joint angles
    cos_angle2 = (dist**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors

    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(joint3_internal), l2 + l3 * math.cos(joint3_internal))
    joint2 = beta - alpha
    
    # Now solve for joint 4 to achieve the desired orientation
    # Calculate the rotation achieved by the first three joints
    R2 = rot_y(joint2)
    R3 = rot_y(joint3)
    R123 = R1 @ R2 @ R3
    
    # Calculate the remaining rotation needed by joint 4
    R4_needed = R123.T @ R_target
    
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z-axis, so we extract the Z rotation angle
    joint4 = math.atan2(R4_needed[1, 0], R4_needed[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates joint 1 based on the target position
2. Transforms the problem to the local frame after joint 1
3. Solves the planar 2-link problem for joints 2 and 3
4. Calculates joint 4 to achieve the desired end-effector orientation

The solution handles the specific kinematic chain of this robot with the given link offsets and joint rotation axes.
