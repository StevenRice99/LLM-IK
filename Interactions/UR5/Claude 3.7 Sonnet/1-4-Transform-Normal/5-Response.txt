I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and forward kinematics results to derive the closed-form solution.

Based on the provided information and forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
1. The first 3 joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The 4th joint rotates around the Z-axis
3. The robot has a specific link structure with offsets between joints

Let me solve this step by step:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    wz = z - wrist_offset[2]
    
    # Joint 1 (base joint) - rotates around Y-axis
    # Since joint 1 rotates around Y, it affects the x and z coordinates
    # We can find the angle by looking at the projection on the XZ plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wx, wz)
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve the planar manipulator problem
    # First, transform wrist position to the plane of the arm after joint 1 rotation
    # Distance from origin to wrist in the XZ plane

    # Y-coordinate of wrist relative to joint 1
    wy_rel = wy + d1  # Adjust for the Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by r_xz and wy_rel

    # Using law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3

    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)

    # For theta2, we need to find the angle to the wrist

```

This solution:
1. Calculates the wrist center position by moving back from the TCP along the local z-axis
2. Computes theta1 based on the wrist position in the XZ plane
3. Solves for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines for the planar manipulator formed after setting theta1
4. Determines theta4 by finding the remaining rotation needed to achieve the desired orientation

The solution handles the specific offsets in the robot's structure and accounts for the different rotation axes (Y-axis for joints 1-3, Z-axis for joint 4).
