Thank you for the feedback. I can see that my inverse kinematics solution has several issues. Let me analyze the failures and develop a corrected solution.

The main issues appear to be:

1. Incorrect handling of the joint rotation axes (Y for joints 1-3, Z for joint 4)
2. Problems with the calculation of joint angles, especially for joints 2 and 3
3. Issues with handling the offsets correctly

Let me revise the solution:

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. All joints rotate around the Y-axis except joint 4, which rotates around Z
2. The robot has specific offsets in the Y and Z directions
3. The provided feedback shows significant discrepancies in my solution

Let me revise the solution with a more careful analysis:
