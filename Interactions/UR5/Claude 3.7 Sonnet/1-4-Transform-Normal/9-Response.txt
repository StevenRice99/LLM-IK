Thank you for the additional feedback. I see that my solution still has significant issues. Let me carefully analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback and develop a more accurate solution.

Looking at the feedback examples, I notice that:
1. The relationship between joint angles and end-effector position/orientation is more complex than I initially modeled
2. There are specific configurations that need to be handled correctly
3. The signs of the angles and the approach to calculating theta3 need revision

Let me develop a more accurate solution:
