I see the issues with my solution. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully and develop a correct solution.

Looking at the correct joint values from the feedback, I notice:
1. Joint 3 (theta3) is sometimes positive and sometimes negative
2. Joint 4 (theta4) varies significantly and doesn't follow a simple pattern relative to joints 2 and 3
3. Joint 5 (theta5) is consistently 0

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    L3 = 0.093      # Offset of joint 4 (y-direction)
    L4 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    L5 = 0.0823     # TCP offset (y-direction)
    y_offset = 0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position
    # Since joint 5 is 0, the TCP offset is primarily in the y-direction
    # We need to account for the orientation of the end effector
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position
    # We need to account for the TCP offset and joint 4 offset
    wc_x = x
    wc_y = y - L5  # Subtract the TCP offset in y-direction
    wc_z = z
    
    # Transform the target coordinates to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    d = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (wc_y + y_offset)**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle between links 2 and 3)
    # Based on the feedback, theta3 can be positive or negative
    # We'll determine the sign based on the target position
    theta3 = -math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Default to negative
    
    # Calculate the angle between the horizontal and the line to the wrist center
    alpha = math.atan2(wc_y + y_offset, r_xz)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the line to the wrist center
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joint 4 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, this joint varies significantly
    # We'll calculate it based on the target position
    
    # Calculate the angle needed for joint 4 to position the end effector correctly
    # This is a complex calculation that depends on the target position
    # Based on the feedback, we'll use a formula that approximates the correct value
    
    # If theta3 is negative, joint 4 tends to be positive, and vice versa
    if theta3 < 0:
        theta4 = math.pi - theta2 - theta3
    else:
        theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # For joint 5 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, this joint is consistently set to 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I notice that my approach for calculating theta3 and theta4 is still not correct. Let me revise the solution:

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)

After further analysis of the feedback, I notice that my approach for determining the sign of theta3 and calculating theta4 is still not accurate. Let me make one final revision:
