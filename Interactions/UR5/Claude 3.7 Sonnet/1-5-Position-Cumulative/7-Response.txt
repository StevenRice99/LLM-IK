Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for the 5-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

Looking at the robot structure:
- Joints 1, 2, 3, and 5 rotate around the Y-axis
- Joint 4 rotates around the Z-axis
- The TCP has an offset from the last joint

Here's my complete solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets from the URDF
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    L3 = 0.093      # Offset of link 3 (y-direction)
    L4 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    L5 = 0.0823     # TCP offset from link 5 (y-direction)
    
    # First, account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 5
    # The TCP is offset in the y-direction in the local frame of joint 5
    # We need to work backwards from the target position
    
    # Since we don't know the orientation yet, we need to solve for joint positions
    # We'll use a geometric approach
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    # This rotates the arm in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # The wrist center (joint 4) position needs to be calculated
    # by subtracting the effect of links 4 and 5 and the TCP offset
    # We need to account for the fact that joint 4 rotates around Z-axis
    # and joint 5 rotates around Y-axis
    
    # For simplification, we'll solve for joints 1, 2, and 3 first
    # by finding the position of joint 4
    
    # The distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # We need to account for the y-offset of the TCP and the wrist
    # The effective y-position for the inverse kinematics calculation
    y_eff = y - L5
    
    # Now we can solve for joints 2 and 3 using the law of cosines
    # We're solving for a 2-link planar manipulator in the plane defined by
    # the distance r and the height y_eff
    
    # Distance from base to wrist center in the plane
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + (y_eff + 0.1197)**2)  # Adding 0.1197 to account for the y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Using law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the target position
    # If the target is below the base, theta2 should be negative
    if y_eff < -0.1197:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate the angle alpha between the first link and the line to the target
    alpha = math.atan2(y_eff + 0.1197, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle beta using the law of sines
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = alpha - beta - theta2
    
    # For joints 4 and 5, we need to ensure the TCP reaches the target
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z-axis
    theta4 = 0  # We can set this to 0 since we're only concerned with position
    
    # Joint 5 rotates around Y-axis
    theta5 = 0  # We can set this to 0 since we're only concerned with position
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. The approach is correct, but there are some issues with the calculations. Let me revise:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p

    L3 = 0.093      # Offset of link 3 (y-direction)
    L4 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    L5 = 0.0823     # TCP offset from link 5 (y-direction)
    
    # First, we need to find the wrist center position
    # by subtracting the effect of the TCP offset
    # Since we're only concerned with position, we can simplify
    # and assume the TCP offset is primarily in the y-direction
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Account for the y-offset of joint 2
    y_adj = y + 0.1197
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - (L2 + L4)**2) / (2 * L1 * (L2 + L4))
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle alpha between the first link and the line to the target
    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle beta using the law of sines
    beta = math.atan2((L2 + L4) * math.sin(theta2), L1 + (L2 + L4) * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = 0  # Simplified for position-only IK
    
    # For joints 4 and 5, we can set them to 0 for position-only IK
    theta4 = 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me revise it one more time to ensure it's correct:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:

    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 5

    # Using law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos

    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta2_final
    theta2_final = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - (L3 + L5), r - (L2 + L4)) - theta2_final - theta1
    
    # For joints 4 and 5, we can set them to 0 for position-only IK
    theta4 = 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a different approach based on the existing code examples:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Account for the TCP offset to find the position of the wrist
    # The TCP is offset by 0.0823 in the y-direction from joint 5
    # Joint 5 is offset by 0.09465 in the z-direction from joint 4
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For the remaining joints, we'll use the approach from existing code 2
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate alpha and beta for theta1 adjustment
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Adjust theta1
    theta1_adjusted = alpha - beta
    
    # For joints 3, 4, and 5, we'll set them to 0 for position-only IK
    theta3 = 0
    theta4 = 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1_adjusted, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This still doesn't fully account for the y-coordinate. Let me make one final revision:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """

    x, y, z = p

    y_offset = 0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # This is a simplification since we don't know the orientation
    y_adj = y - L5
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Transform the target to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    d_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the total distance to the adjusted target
    d = math.sqrt(d_xz**2 + (y_adj + y_offset)**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate alpha (angle between horizontal and line to target)
    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj + y_offset, d_xz)
    
    # Calculate beta (angle between link 1 and line to joint 3)

    theta3 = 0
    theta4 = 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

After careful consideration of the robot structure and the existing code examples, here's my final solution:
