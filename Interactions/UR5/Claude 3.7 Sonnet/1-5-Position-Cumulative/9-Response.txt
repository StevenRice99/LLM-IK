I see the issue with my solution. The main problem is that I was setting joints 3, 4, and 5 to zero, which is incorrect. Let me analyze the feedback and develop a proper solution that accounts for all 5 joints.

Looking at the correct joint values from the feedback, I can see that all 5 joints need to be calculated properly to reach the target positions. Let me develop a complete inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    L3 = 0.093      # Offset of joint 4 (y-direction)
    L4 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    L5 = 0.0823     # TCP offset (y-direction)
    y_offset = 0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # First, we need to find the wrist center (position of joint 4)
    # by working backwards from the TCP
    
    # Since we're dealing with a position-only IK problem and the TCP has an offset,
    # we need to account for this offset when calculating the wrist center
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position
    # We need to subtract the TCP offset from the target position
    # The TCP is offset by L5 in the y-direction from joint 5
    # Joint 5 is offset by L4 in the z-direction from joint 4
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 4)
    # We need to account for the TCP offset and the orientation
    # Since we don't know the orientation yet, we'll use a geometric approach
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3
    # Joint 3 is at a distance L2 from joint 2 along the arm
    
    # Calculate the total arm length (from joint 2 to TCP)
    arm_length = math.sqrt(L2**2 + L3**2 + L4**2 + L5**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (y + y_offset)**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 + L1**2 - arm_length**2) / (2 * L1 * d)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate the angle at joint 2
    angle_at_joint2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the horizontal and the line to the target
    alpha = math.atan2(y + y_offset, r_xz)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha - angle_at_joint2
    
    # Using law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (L1**2 + arm_length**2 - d**2) / (2 * L1 * arm_length)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.pi - math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # For joint 4 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint affects the orientation of the end effector
    # For position-only IK, we can calculate a value that helps reach the target
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # For joint 5 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This joint also affects the orientation of the end effector
    # For position-only IK, we'll set it to 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution still has issues. Let me refine it further based on the feedback:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    L3 = 0.093      # Offset of joint 4 (y-direction)
    L4 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    L5 = 0.0823     # TCP offset (y-direction)
    y_offset = 0.1197  # Y-offset of joint 2
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position by accounting for the TCP offset
    # Since we're dealing with position-only IK, we'll make a simplification
    # and assume the TCP offset is primarily in the y-direction
    wc_x = x
    wc_y = y - L5
    wc_z = z
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_z)
    
    # Transform the target coordinates to the plane of joints 2 and 3
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    # We need to solve for a 2-link planar manipulator in the plane defined by
    # the distance r_xz and the height (wc_y + y_offset)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    d = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (wc_y + y_offset)**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - d**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle between links 2 and 3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3) - math.pi  # Adjust to match the expected range
    
    # Calculate the angle between the horizontal and the line to the wrist center
    alpha = math.atan2(wc_y + y_offset, r_xz)
    
    # Calculate the angle between link 1 and the line to the wrist center
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(math.pi + theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(math.pi + theta3))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joint 4 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, this joint needs to be calculated to reach the target
    # We'll use a value that helps position the end effector correctly
    theta4 = math.pi - theta2 - theta3
    
    # For joint 5 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, this joint is consistently set to 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I notice that joint 5 is consistently set to 0 in the correct solutions. Let me make one final revision to ensure the solution is correct:

```python
import math

    """

    x, y, z = p

    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 4)
    # Since joint 5 is 0, the TCP offset is primarily in the y-direction
    wc_x = x - L5 * math.sin(theta1)

    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    d = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (wc_y + y_offset)**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos

    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joint 4 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, this joint needs to be calculated to reach the target
    theta4 = math.pi - theta2 - theta3

    # Based on the feedback, this joint is consistently set to 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```
