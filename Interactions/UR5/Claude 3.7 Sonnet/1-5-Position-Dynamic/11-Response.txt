Based on the feedback, I can see that my solution has significant issues. The main problems appear to be:

1. Not properly accounting for the TCP offset and other link offsets
2. Not correctly handling joint 4 and joint 5
3. Issues with the calculation of joint angles, especially for joint 3

Let me develop a more accurate solution by analyzing the correct joint values provided in the feedback:

```python
import math

    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    d1 = 0.1197     # Offset of link 1 (y-direction, negative)
    d2 = 0.093      # Offset of link 3 to 4 (y-direction, positive)
    d3 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    d4 = 0.0823     # TCP offset (y-direction, positive)
    
    # We need to account for the TCP offset and find the position of joint 5
    # The TCP is offset from joint 5 by d4 in the y-direction when all joints are at 0
    # But the actual offset direction depends on joint 4's rotation
    
    # First, we'll solve for joint 1 which determines the x-z plane
    # We need to find the projection of the target onto the x-z plane
    r_target = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The maximum reach in the x-z plane depends on the robot's geometry
    # We need to account for the TCP offset which can contribute to the reach
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 which determine the position in the 
    # plane defined by joint 1's rotation
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 5 (wrist) to solve for joints 2 and 3

    # and use joint 4 to orient the end effector
    theta5 = 0
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 5 (wrist center)
    # When joint 4 is 0, the TCP offset is purely in the y-direction

    # For now, let's calculate the wrist position assuming joint 4 is 0
    # We'll refine this later
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y - d4
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist in the y-r plane
    r_wrist = math.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)

    y_adj = wrist_y + d1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    D = math.sqrt(r_wrist**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between links 1 and 2

    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj, r_wrist)
    
    # Then find the angle between the base-to-wrist line and link 1
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(interior_angle), L1 + L2 * math.cos(interior_angle))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # For joint 4, we need to consider the orientation of the end effector
    # Since we're only concerned with position, we can set it to a value that
    # helps us reach the target position
    
    # Based on the feedback examples, joint 4 seems to be calculated to help
    # position the TCP correctly
    
    # Let's calculate joint 4 based on the target position and the position
    # achieved by joints 1, 2, and 3
    
    # For a position-only IK solution, we can use a heuristic approach

Wait, this approach still has issues. Let me revise it based on a more careful analysis of the feedback examples:
