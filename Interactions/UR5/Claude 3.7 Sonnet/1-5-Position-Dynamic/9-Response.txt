Based on the forward kinematics results, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for the 5-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see:
- Joints 1, 2, 3, and 5 rotate around the Y-axis
- Joint 4 rotates around the Z-axis
- There are specific link offsets that need to be accounted for

Here's my complete solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    d1 = 0.1197     # Offset of link 1 (y-direction, negative)
    d2 = 0.093      # Offset of link 3 to 4 (y-direction, positive)
    d3 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    d4 = 0.0823     # TCP offset (y-direction, positive)
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the wrist position
    # The TCP is offset in the y-direction by d4 from the wrist
    # We need to subtract this offset to find the wrist position
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (joint 5)
    wrist_y = y - d4
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This joint determines the x-z plane position
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the x-z plane
    r = math.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2 and the offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    y_adj = wrist_y + d1 - d2
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist in the adjusted y-r plane
    D = math.sqrt(r**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the angle alpha (angle between the line from base to wrist and the horizontal)
    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle beta (angle between the line from base to wrist and link 1)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta2 (angle of joint 2)
    theta2_final = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)
    theta3 = -theta2 - theta2_final
    
    # For a 5-DOF robot, we can't fully control orientation
    # Joint 4 (rotation around Z) and joint 5 (rotation around Y) are used to point the end effector
    
    # For simplicity, we can set joint 4 to orient the end effector in the desired direction
    # and joint 5 to align with the target
    theta4 = 0  # Default value, can be adjusted based on desired end effector orientation
    theta5 = 0  # Default value, can be adjusted based on desired end effector orientation
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. The approach is correct, but there are some issues with the calculations for joints 4 and 5. Let me revise:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    L1 = 0.425      # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.39225    # Length of link 2 (z-direction)
    d1 = 0.1197     # Offset of link 1 (y-direction, negative)
    d2 = 0.093      # Offset of link 3 to 4 (y-direction, positive)
    d3 = 0.09465    # Length of link 4 (z-direction)
    d4 = 0.0823     # TCP offset (y-direction, positive)
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the wrist position
    # The TCP is offset in the y-direction by d4 from the wrist
    wrist_y = y - d4
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_z = z
    
    # For the first 3 joints, we can use the existing solution from EXISTING 1
    # but we need to adjust for the full chain
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Project the wrist position onto the x-z plane
    r = math.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2 and the offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    y_adj = wrist_y + d1 - d2
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist in the adjusted y-r plane
    D = math.sqrt(r**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    # If the cross product is negative, we need to use the negative solution
    cross_product = r * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - y_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate the angle alpha (angle between the line from base to wrist and the horizontal)
    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle beta (angle between the line from base to wrist and link 1)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta2 (angle of joint 2)
    theta2_final = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3 (angle of joint 3)
    theta3 = -theta2
    
    # For joints 4 and 5, we can use a simplified approach since we're only concerned with position
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z and joint 5 rotates around Y
    # For a position-only IK solution, we can set these to 0
    theta4 = 0
    theta5 = 0
    
    return (theta1, theta2_final, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution focuses on positioning the end effector at the target position. Since we're only concerned with position (not orientation), joints 4 and 5 are set to 0 as a default. In a full IK solution that includes orientation, these joints would be calculated based on the desired end effector orientation.
