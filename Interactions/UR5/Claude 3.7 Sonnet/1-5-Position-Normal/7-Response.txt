I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 5-DOF robot manipulator. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and derive the inverse kinematics equations.

Based on the robot description and forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
- Joints 1, 2, 3, and 5 rotate around the Y-axis
- Joint 4 rotates around the Z-axis
- The robot has a specific configuration with offsets between joints

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot parameters from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.425       # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.39225     # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.093       # Offset of joint 4 in y direction
    l4 = 0.09465     # Distance from joint 4 to joint 5
    l5 = 0.0823      # Distance from joint 5 to TCP
    
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    
    # Adjust target position to account for the TCP offset
    # We need to find the position of joint 5, not the TCP
    # Since joint 5 rotates around Y, and TCP has an offset in Y direction
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2 and the TCP offset
    # We need to work in the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    y_target = y - l5 - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target in the joint 1 rotation plane
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_target**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find angles for joints 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = -np.arccos(cos_theta3)  # Negative because of the robot configuration
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and arctangent
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target, r)
    gamma = np.arccos((l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d))
    theta2 = beta + gamma
    
    # Joint 4 and 5 are used to orient the end effector
    # For position-only IK, we can set them to convenient values
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z, so it doesn't affect the TCP position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 5 rotates around Y, and with the TCP offset, it can affect the position
    # For a position-only solution, we can set it to 0
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me reconsider the problem:

1. The TCP has an offset in the Y direction (0.0823) and a rotation around Z (1.57...)
2. Joint 5 rotates around Y, which means it affects the TCP position in X and Z directions
3. Joint 4 rotates around Z, which means it affects the TCP position in X and Y directions

Let me correct the solution:

```python

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np

    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    
    # Since joints 4 and 5 are used for orientation, and we're only concerned with position,
    # we can set them to 0 and calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 5)
    # Then we solve the inverse kinematics for the first 3 joints to reach that position

    # Calculate the distance from origin to the wrist in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x_wrist**2 + z_wrist**2)
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of joint 2
    y_adj = y_wrist - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_adj**2)

    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Let me refine this solution one more time to ensure it's correct:

```python

    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos

    theta2 = beta + gamma
    
    # For position-only IK, we can set joints 4 and 5 to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution should work for the position-only inverse kinematics of this 5-DOF robot. The approach:

1. Calculate the wrist center position by accounting for the TCP offset
2. Solve for joint 1 angle using the arctan2 function
3. Use the law of cosines to solve for joint 3 angle
4. Calculate joint 2 angle using a combination of arctan2 and the law of cosines
5. Set joints 4 and 5 to 0 since they primarily affect orientation
