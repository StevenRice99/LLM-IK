I see the issues with my previous solution. Let me analyze the feedback and correct my approach to the inverse kinematics problem.

The main problems with my previous solution:
1. I didn't properly account for the full kinematic chain
2. I set joints 4 and 5 to 0, but the correct solution uses specific values for joint 4
3. There are NaN values in some solutions, indicating mathematical errors

Let me develop a more accurate solution:

```python

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position

    l2 = 0.39225     # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z direction)
    l3 = 0.093       # Offset of joint 4 in y direction
    l4 = 0.09465     # Distance from joint 4 to joint 5 (z direction)
    l5 = 0.0823      # Distance from joint 5 to TCP (y direction)
    
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Y offset of joint 2
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Calculate the planar distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # We need to account for the full kinematic chain
    # The end effector position is affected by all joints
    
    # For a 5-DOF robot, we typically have one redundant DOF for position
    # We can set joint 5 to 0 as it primarily affects orientation
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    # Now we need to find the position of joint 4 when joint 5 is 0
    # The TCP is offset from joint 5 by l5 in the y direction when joint 5 is 0
    
    # We need to solve for joint 4 angle that will allow joints 1-3 to position
    # the wrist center (joint 4) correctly
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position (joint 4)
    # When joint 5 is 0, the TCP is offset by l5 in the y direction and l4 in the z direction

    # Let's try a different approach - we'll solve for a configuration where joint 4
    # is set to a value that allows the arm to reach the target
    
    # First, calculate the position of joint 3 when joints 4 and 5 are at specific values
    # that allow reaching the target
    
    # We'll use an analytical approach to find a valid joint 4 value
    # Joint 4 rotates around Z, so it affects the X and Y coordinates
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XY plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x_target**2 + y_target**2)
    
    # The maximum reach of the arm in the XZ plane is l1 + l2 + l3 + l4 + l5
    max_reach = l1 + l2 + l3 + l4 + l5
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle that will allow the arm to reach the target
    # This is a simplification - in reality, we need to solve the full IK problem

    theta4 = np.arctan2(y_target, x_target) - theta1
    
    # Now calculate the position of joint 3

    # Calculate the position of joint 3 in the robot's base frame

    y3 = y_target - l5 * np.cos(theta1 + theta4) - l3
    z3 = z_target - l4
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to joint 3
    d13 = np.sqrt(x3**2 + (y3 - y_offset)**2 + z3**2)

    cos_theta3 = (d13**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution further. Let me take a more systematic approach:
