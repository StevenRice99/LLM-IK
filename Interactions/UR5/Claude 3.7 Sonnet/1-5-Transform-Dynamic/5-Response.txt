Based on the forward kinematics results, I can now develop a solution for the inverse kinematics of this 5-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

First, let's understand the robot structure:
- 5 revolute joints
- Joints 1, 2, 3, and 5 rotate around Y-axis
- Joint 4 rotates around Z-axis
- The TCP has an offset and orientation relative to the last joint

I'll now complete the inverse kinematics function by combining insights from the provided existing solutions:

```python

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Create rotation matrix from target orientation
    R_target = np.array([
        [math.cos(rz) * math.cos(ry), 
         math.cos(rz) * math.sin(ry) * math.sin(rx) - math.sin(rz) * math.cos(rx),

    R_tcp = np.array([
        [math.cos(tcp_rz), -math.sin(tcp_rz), 0],

    ])
    
    # Calculate the wrist position by removing the TCP offset
    wrist_pos = np.array([x, y, z]) - R_target @ tcp_offset
    
    # Calculate the wrist orientation
    R_wrist = R_target @ R_tcp.T
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_pos[0], wrist_pos[2])
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 1
    R1 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta1), 0, math.sin(theta1)],

    # Transform wrist position to joint 1 frame
    wrist_in_j1 = R1.T @ (wrist_pos - np.array([0, 0, 0]))
    
    # Extract coordinates in joint 1 frame
    x1, y1, z1 = wrist_in_j1
    
    # Calculate distance from joint 2 to wrist
    # Joint 2 position is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    j2_pos = np.array([0, -0.1197, 0.425])
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist relative to joint 2
    wrist_rel_j2 = wrist_in_j1 - j2_pos
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist
    L = np.linalg.norm(wrist_rel_j2)
    
    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    l3 = math.sqrt(0.093**2 + 0.09465**2)  # Length of combined links 3 and 4
    
    # Calculate joint 3 using law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (L**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 using law of cosines and atan2

    # Calculate the orientation of the first three joints
    R_3joints = R1 @ np.array([
        [math.cos(theta2 + theta3), 0, math.sin(theta2 + theta3)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(theta2 + theta3), 0, math.cos(theta2 + theta3)]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the remaining rotation needed for the wrist
    R_45 = R_3joints.T @ R_wrist
    
    # Extract joint 4 (rotation around Z)
    theta4 = math.atan2(R_45[1, 0], R_45[0, 0])
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 4
    R4 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta4), -math.sin(theta4), 0],
        [math.sin(theta4), math.cos(theta4), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the remaining rotation for joint 5
    R5 = R4.T @ R_45
    
    # Extract joint 5 (rotation around Y)
    theta5 = math.atan2(-R5[2, 0], R5[2, 2])
    
    # Return all joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This solution follows these steps:
1. Calculate the wrist position by accounting for the TCP offset
2. Solve for joint 1 (base rotation) using atan2
3. Transform the wrist position to the joint 1 frame
4. Use the law of cosines to solve for joints 2 and 3
5. Calculate the orientation achieved by the first three joints
6. Determine the remaining rotation needed for joints 4 and 5
7. Extract joint 4 (Z-axis rotation) and joint 5 (Y-axis rotation) angles

The solution handles the kinematic chain properly and accounts for the TCP offset and orientation.
