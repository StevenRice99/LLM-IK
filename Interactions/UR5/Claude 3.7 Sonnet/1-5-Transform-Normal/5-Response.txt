I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 5-DOF robot manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

Based on the forward kinematics results and the robot description, I can see that:
- The robot has 5 revolute joints
- 4 joints rotate around the Y-axis (joints 1, 2, 3, and 5)
- 1 joint rotates around the Z-axis (joint 4)
- The TCP has a fixed orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.570796325] radians

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

```

This solution:
1. Calculates the wrist position by moving back from the TCP along the approach vector
2. Computes joint 1 angle based on the wrist position
3. Transforms the wrist position to joint 1's frame
4. Uses the law of cosines to solve for joints 2 and 3 (planar arm solution)
5. Calculates joint 4 to align with the approach vector
6. Determines joint 5 to match the desired end-effector orientation

Note that for a 5-DOF robot, we cannot fully control both position and orientation in 3D space (which would require 6 DOF). This solution prioritizes reaching the target position while best approximating the desired orientation.
