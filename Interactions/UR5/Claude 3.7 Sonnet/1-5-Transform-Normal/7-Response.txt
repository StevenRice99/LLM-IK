Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues, particularly with handling edge cases and correctly calculating the joint angles. Let me revise the inverse kinematics solution with a more robust approach.

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

This revised solution:

1. Properly calculates the wrist position by accounting for the TCP offset in the correct frame
2. Uses a more robust approach for calculating joint angles using the law of cosines
3. Properly handles the transformation between different joint frames
4. Correctly extracts the joint 4 and 5 angles from the remaining rotation needed
5. Normalizes all angles to be within the joint limits

The key improvements include:
- Better handling of the robot's kinematic structure
- More accurate calculation of the wrist position
- Proper consideration of the joint rotation axes (Y for joints 1, 2, 3, 5 and Z for joint 4)
- More robust angle calculations with proper clipping to avoid numerical issues
