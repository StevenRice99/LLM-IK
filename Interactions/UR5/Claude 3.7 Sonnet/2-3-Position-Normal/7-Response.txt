I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics tests.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can observe:
1. Both joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
3. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.3922498756300121, 0.093, 0.00031235915228512256]
4. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2), the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]

From the DETAILS section:
- Link 1 (Revolute 1) is at the origin with rotation around Y-axis
- Link 2 (Revolute 2) is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to Link 1, also rotating around Y-axis
- The TCP is positioned at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to Link 2

Let me derive the forward kinematics equations first, then invert them:

For a joint rotating around the Y-axis, the rotation matrix is:
```
R_y(θ) = [cos(θ)  0  sin(θ)]
         [   0    1     0   ]
         [-sin(θ) 0  cos(θ)]
```

Let's denote:
- θ1 as the angle of joint 1
- θ2 as the angle of joint 2
- L1 = 0.39225 (length of link 1 in z-direction)
- TCP_offset = [0, 0.093, 0] (TCP offset from link 2)

The forward kinematics can be derived as:
1. Start at origin
2. Rotate by θ1 around Y-axis
3. Translate by [0, 0, L1]
4. Rotate by θ2 around Y-axis
5. Translate by TCP_offset

Now, let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    y_offset = 0.093  # y-offset of TCP from link 2
    
    # Adjust y to account for the constant y-offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to the target in the xz-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint angles
    # For joint 1, we need the angle in the xz-plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to ensure the end effector reaches the target
    # Since joint 2 doesn't affect the position in this case (as seen from test 3),
    # we can set it to 0
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The forward kinematics tests show that joint 2 doesn't seem to affect the TCP position in the way I initially thought. Let me analyze the tests more carefully:

Test 1: Both joints at 0 → TCP at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
Test 2: Joint 1 at π/2, Joint 2 at 0 → TCP at [0.3922498756300121, 0.093, 0.00031235915228512256]
Test 3: Joint 1 at 0, Joint 2 at π/2 → TCP at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]

It appears that joint 2 doesn't affect the position when joint 1 is 0. Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    y_offset = 0.093  # y-offset of TCP from link 2
    
    # Adjust y to account for the constant y-offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # For this robot, joint 1 rotates the entire arm around the Y-axis
    # This means it controls the angle in the XZ plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 2 doesn't seem to affect the position based on the tests
    # So we'll set it to 0
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Actually, I need to reconsider this again. Let me try one more test to better understand the kinematics.
