I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF serial manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics tests.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can observe:
1. Both joints rotate around the Y-axis
2. The first link is at the origin and has length 0.39225 along the Z-axis
3. The second link (TCP) extends 0.093 along the Y-axis from the second joint

Let me analyze the forward kinematics to derive the inverse kinematics solution:

When joint angles are (0,0):
- TCP position is [0, 0.093, 0.39225]

When joint angles are (1.57,0):
- TCP position is [0.39225, 0.093, 0.00031] (Z value is nearly 0 due to rotation)

When joint angles are (0,1.57):
- TCP position is [0, 0.093, 0.39225] (no change from (0,0) because the second joint's rotation doesn't affect position when the first joint is at 0)

Based on these observations, I can derive the forward kinematics equations:
- The first joint rotates the entire arm around the Y-axis
- The second joint doesn't seem to contribute to position change in the tests provided

Let me complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Length of the first link
    l1 = 0.39225
    
    # Y-offset of the TCP from the second joint
    y_offset = 0.093
    
    # Adjust y for the offset
    y_target = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # Since the second joint also rotates around Y-axis, it affects the reach in the XZ plane
    joint2 = np.arcsin(r/l1) if r <= l1 else 0
    
    # If the target is below the XY plane (negative Z), adjust joint2
    if z < 0 and x == 0:
        joint2 = np.pi - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The forward kinematics tests don't provide enough information about how joint2 affects the position. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Length of the first link
    l1 = 0.39225
    
    # Y-offset of the TCP from the second joint
    y_offset = 0.093
    
    # Adjust y for the offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint2, we need to determine how it affects the reach
    # Based on the forward kinematics tests, it appears joint2 doesn't change the TCP position
    # when joint1 is 0, which suggests it might be a wrist-like joint
    
    # Since we're told all targets are reachable, and joint2 rotates around Y,
    # it must contribute to positioning in the XZ plane after joint1's rotation
    
    # The second joint angle can be calculated based on the desired reach
    joint2 = 0  # Default value
    
    # If the target is not directly along the first link's axis
    if r < l1:
        # Calculate the angle needed to reach the target
        joint2 = np.arccos(r/l1)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After further consideration, I realize my solution is still incomplete. Let me provide the correct solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust y for the TCP offset (0.093 along Y-axis)
    y_adjusted = y - 0.093
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # For a 2-DOF arm with both joints rotating around Y-axis,
    # joint2 controls the extension in the plane defined by joint1's rotation
    joint2 = np.arccos(r / 0.39225) if r < 0.39225 else 0
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
