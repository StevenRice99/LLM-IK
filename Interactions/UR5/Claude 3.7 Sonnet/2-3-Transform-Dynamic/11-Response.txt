I see the issue now. Looking at the failed test cases, I notice that the orientation parameter `r` contains roll, pitch, and yaw values, and in all the failed cases, the roll and yaw are both π (3.14159...). This indicates that the TCP needs to be oriented with a 180-degree rotation around both the X and Z axes.

The key insight is that when the roll and yaw are both π, we need to adjust our joint angle calculations to account for this specific orientation. Let me correct the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Check if we have the special case where roll and yaw are both π (3.14159...)
    if abs(roll - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(yaw - math.pi) < 1e-6:
        # For this orientation, we need to adjust our approach
        joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
        
        # When roll and yaw are both π, we need to add π to joint2
        joint2 = pitch - joint1 + math.pi
    else:
        # Standard case
        joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Looking at the correct joint values from the failed test cases, I can see that there's a consistent pattern. Let me refine the solution further:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 based on the target position
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Check if we have the special case where roll and yaw are both π (3.14159...)
    if abs(roll - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(yaw - math.pi) < 1e-6:
        # For this orientation, we need to add π to joint2 and negate the pitch
        joint2 = -pitch - joint1 + math.pi
    else:
        # Standard case
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After analyzing the correct joint values more carefully, I see that when roll and yaw are both π, the relationship between pitch and joint angles is different. Let me make one final adjustment:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 based on the target position
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Check if we have the special case where roll and yaw are both π (3.14159...)
    if abs(roll - math.pi) < 1e-6 and abs(yaw - math.pi) < 1e-6:
        # When roll and yaw are both π, we need to adjust joint2 calculation
        joint2 = math.pi - pitch - joint1
    else:
        # Standard case
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
