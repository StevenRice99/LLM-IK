Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze what I've observed:

1. The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis.
2. The first joint is at the origin, and the second joint is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the first.
3. The TCP (Tool Center Point) is at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to the second joint.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how the joint angles affect the final position:
- When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
- When joint 1 is at π/2 (1.57) and joint 2 is at 0, the TCP is at [0.39225, 0.093, 0.00031]
- When joint 1 is at 0 and joint 2 is at π/2 (1.57), the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
- When both joints are at π/2 (1.57), the TCP is at [0.39225, 0.093, 0.00031]

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # For this robot, the y-coordinate is fixed by the TCP offset and doesn't affect joint angles
    # We need to solve for joint1 and joint2 to reach the target x and z coordinates
    
    # The first joint rotates around the Y-axis and determines the plane in which the arm lies
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis (in the local frame)
    # We need to account for the orientation of the first joint
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    distance_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The length of the second link is 0.39225
    link2_length = 0.39225
    
    # For a 2-DOF planar robot, we can directly compute joint2
    # Since both joints rotate around Y, the TCP will always be at the same y-coordinate
    # We only need to match the x and z coordinates
    
    # If joint1 is at angle θ1, then the position of joint2 is:
    # [link2_length * sin(θ1), 0, link2_length * cos(θ1)]
    
    # For the TCP to reach position [x, z], we need:
    # x = link2_length * sin(θ1)
    # z = link2_length * cos(θ1)
    
    # Since we've already calculated θ1 = atan2(x, z), we know this is satisfied
    # The second joint doesn't affect the position in this configuration
    
    # Therefore, joint2 is determined by the desired orientation
    # The orientation parameter r represents [roll, pitch, yaw]
    # For this robot, the pitch (rotation around Y) is what we can control with joint2
    _, pitch, _ = r
    
    # The pitch of the TCP is the sum of joint1 and joint2 angles
    # So joint2 = desired_pitch - joint1
    joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The forward kinematics tests show that the orientation is affected by both joints, and the position calculations are more complex than I initially thought.

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # For this robot, the y-coordinate is offset by 0.093 from the second joint
    # We need to account for this in our calculations
    
    # The first joint determines the plane in which the arm lies
    # For a target at [x, z], the angle of the first joint is:
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # The second joint determines the orientation of the end effector
    # The orientation is the sum of the two joint angles
    joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to test this solution more carefully. Let me reconsider the problem:

1. The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis.
2. The first joint is at the origin, and the second joint is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the first.
3. The TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to the second joint.

For a 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around the Y-axis, the inverse kinematics solution should be:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    _, pitch, _ = r
    
    # The first joint angle is determined by the target position in the XZ plane
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # The second joint angle is determined by the desired pitch orientation
    # Since both joints rotate around Y, the total pitch is the sum of the joint angles
    joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

This solution assumes that:
1. The target position [x, y, z] is reachable by the robot
2. The y-coordinate is fixed at 0.093 (the TCP offset)
3. The orientation is primarily determined by the pitch component
