I see the issue with my previous solution. Looking at the failed test cases, I notice that when the orientation includes [π, y, π], my solution is not handling it correctly. This specific orientation pattern (π around x and z axes) indicates a 180-degree rotation that I need to account for properly.

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Check if we have the special case of [π, y, π] orientation
    flipped = abs(rx - math.pi) < 1e-10 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 1e-10
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider the orientation and whether we're in the flipped state
    if flipped:
        # When flipped, we need to add π to theta2 and adjust theta1
        theta2 = ry - theta1 + math.pi
    else:
        theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, this still doesn't fully account for the pattern I'm seeing in the correct solutions. Let me analyze the test cases more carefully.

Looking at the failed test cases and comparing my outputs with the correct joint values, I notice that when rx and rz are both π (3.14159...), there's a consistent pattern in how theta2 should be calculated. Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Check if we have the special case of [π, y, π] orientation
    flipped = abs(rx - math.pi) < 1e-10 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 1e-10
    
    if flipped:
        # When in the flipped orientation, theta2 needs to be calculated differently
        theta2 = ry + math.pi - theta1
    else:
        theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    theta2 = ((theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi)) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Looking at the test cases again, I see that when the orientation is [π, y, π], the correct theta2 values don't follow a simple pattern relative to ry and theta1. Let me try a different approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Check if we have the special case of [π, y, π] orientation
    flipped = abs(rx - math.pi) < 1e-10 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 1e-10
    
    if flipped:
        # When in the flipped orientation, we need to add π to theta2
        theta2 = ry + math.pi
    else:
        theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-2π, 2π]
    theta2 = theta2 % (2 * math.pi)
    # If greater than π, subtract 2π
    if theta2 > math.pi:
        theta2 -= 2 * math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

After analyzing the test cases more carefully, I see that when the orientation is [π, y, π], the relationship between theta2 and ry is more complex. Let me make one final correction:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Check if we have the special case of [π, y, π] orientation
    flipped = abs(rx - math.pi) < 1e-10 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 1e-10
    
    if flipped:
        # When in the flipped orientation
        theta2 = math.pi - ry - theta1
    else:
        theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
