Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze what I've observed:

1. The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis
2. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
3. When joint 1 is at Ï€/2 (1.57), the TCP moves to [0.39225, 0.093, 0.00031]
4. The orientation of the TCP is affected by both joints

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of first link
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # First, find the position of the TCP in the frame of joint 2
    # We need to account for the y-offset of the TCP (0.093)
    # The y value doesn't affect the calculation of theta1 and theta2 since both rotate around Y
    
    # Distance from origin to TCP projection on XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider the orientation
    # When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
    # This means the second link is pointing in the Z direction
    
    # The orientation parameter ry tells us the desired angle of the second link
    # For a Y-axis rotation, ry is the angle we want
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The orientation parameter doesn't directly map to joint angles. Let me revise:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of first link
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider the orientation
    # The orientation parameter ry gives us the desired rotation around Y-axis
    # Since both joints rotate around Y, their effects add up
    # So joint 2 angle is the difference between desired orientation and joint 1 angle
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
