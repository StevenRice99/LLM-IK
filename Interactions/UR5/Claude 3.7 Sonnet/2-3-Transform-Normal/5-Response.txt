I'll solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and derive the inverse kinematics solution.

From the FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests, I can see:

1. When both joints are at 0:
   - TCP position is [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
   - This shows the robot is initially pointing straight up along the z-axis

2. When joints are at 0.5, 0.5:
   - TCP position is [0.18805466751749864, 0.093, 0.3442317599014987]
   - The robot has rotated and the end effector has moved

Based on the details provided:
- Both revolute joints rotate around the Y-axis
- The first joint is at the origin
- The second joint is 0.39225 units above the first joint along the z-axis
- The TCP is 0.093 units along the y-axis from the second joint

Now I'll derive the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust for the y-offset of the TCP
    # Since the TCP is offset by 0.093 in the y direction from the second joint
    # We need to account for this when calculating joint angles
    y_adjusted = y - 0.093
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the xz-plane
    # This is the projection of the target onto the xz-plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Length of the first link (from joint 1 to joint 2)
    l1 = 0.39225
    
    # For a 2-DOF planar manipulator with revolute joints around the Y-axis,
    # we can use the law of cosines to find the angle of the second joint
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using the law of cosines
    # r_xz^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(theta2)
    # Since l2 is effectively 0 (the TCP is offset in y, not in the xz-plane),
    # we need to use the direct angle to the target
    
    # The angle of joint 2 is the orientation around the y-axis
    # which is directly given by r[1]
    joint2 = r[1]
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    # This is the angle to the target in the xz-plane
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The TCP has a y-offset, but the robot is still a planar manipulator in the xz-plane. Let me revise my approach.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the robot operates in the XZ plane
    # The y-coordinate of the TCP is fixed at 0.093
    
    # The orientation r[1] (rotation around Y-axis) determines the angle of the second joint
    joint2 = r[1]
    
    # For joint1, we need to calculate the angle that points the first link toward the target
    # after accounting for the rotation of the second joint
    
    # First, calculate the position of the second joint when joint1 = 0
    # This is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    
    # Then, calculate where the TCP would be if joint1 = 0 and joint2 = r[1]
    # The TCP is offset by 0.093 in the y direction
    # For the x and z coordinates, we need to apply the rotation of joint2
    
    # When joint2 rotates by angle θ around the Y-axis:
    # x_tcp = 0 + 0 * cos(θ) - 0.39225 * sin(θ) = -0.39225 * sin(θ)
    # z_tcp = 0.39225 + 0 * sin(θ) + 0.39225 * cos(θ) = 0.39225 * (1 + cos(θ))
    
    # To reach the target position [x, z], we need to rotate joint1 by:
    # joint1 = arctan2(x - x_tcp, z - z_tcp)
    
    x_tcp = -0.39225 * np.sin(joint2)
    z_tcp = 0.39225 * (1 + np.cos(joint2))
    
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x - x_tcp, z - z_tcp)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Let me think more carefully about the forward kinematics.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # The y component of the target should be 0.093 (the fixed y-offset of the TCP)
    # If it's not, the target is not reachable with the given constraints
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around the Y-axis:
    # The second joint angle is directly the desired orientation around the Y-axis
    joint2 = r[1]
    
    # The first joint angle needs to be calculated to position the TCP at the target
    # When joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
    # When joint2 = θ, the TCP rotates around the Y-axis at the second joint
    
    # Calculate the position of the second joint after rotating joint1
    # This is the point around which joint2 rotates
    
    # To find joint1, we need to solve for the angle that makes the TCP reach the target
    # after applying joint2's rotation
    
    # The position of the second joint after rotating joint1 by α:
    # [0.39225 * sin(α), 0, 0.39225 * cos(α)]
    
    # The position of the TCP after rotating joint2 by θ:
    # x = 0.39225 * sin(α)
    # z = 0.39225 * cos(α)
    
    # We need to solve for α (joint1) such that [x, z] matches the target
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I'm still not getting this right. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully.

Based on the FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests:
1. When both joints are 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
2. When both joints are 0.5, the TCP is at [0.18805466751749864, 0.093, 0.3442317599014987]

Let me complete the solution:

    # To find joint1, we need to determine what angle will position the robot
    # such that after applying joint2's rotation, the TCP reaches the target
    
    # The TCP is offset by 0.093 in the y direction from the second joint
    # This offset doesn't affect the calculation of joint angles since it's perpendicular
    # to the plane of rotation
    
    # Calculate the position of the TCP in the xz-plane
    # We need to find joint1 such that after rotating joint2, the TCP reaches [x, z]

    # x = 0.39225 * sin(α)
    # z = 0.39225 * cos(α)
    
    # This isn't right. Let me reconsider the forward kinematics.
    
    # From the test with joint1=0.5 and joint2=0.5:
    # The second joint is at [0.18805466751749864, 0, 0.3442317599014987]
    # This suggests that when joint1 rotates by 0.5, the second joint moves to this position
    
    # Let's solve this systematically:
    
    # When joint1 rotates by α, the second joint is at:
    # [L1 * sin(α), 0, L1 * cos(α)] where L1 = 0.39225
    
    # When joint2 rotates by θ, the TCP is offset from the second joint by:
    # [0, 0.093, 0] in the local frame of the second joint
    
    # In the global frame, this becomes:
    # [L1 * sin(α), 0.093, L1 * cos(α)]
    
    # This doesn't account for joint2's rotation. Let me correct this.
    
    # When joint2 rotates by θ, the TCP is at:
    # x = L1 * sin(α)
    # y = 0.093
    # z = L1 * cos(α)
    
    # This still doesn't account for joint2's rotation. Let me try again.
    
    # When joint1 = α and joint2 = 0, the second joint is at:
    # [L1 * sin(α), 0, L1 * cos(α)]
    
    # When joint1 = α and joint2 = θ, the TCP is at:
    # x = L1 * sin(α)
    # y = 0.093
    # z = L1 * cos(α)
    
    # This doesn't match the test results. Let me reconsider.
    
    # From the test with joint1=0.5 and joint2=0.5:
    # The TCP is at [0.18805466751749864, 0.093, 0.3442317599014987]
    
    # Let's solve for joint1 directly:
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)

I need to be more precise. Let me solve this step by step:
