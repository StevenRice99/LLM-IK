I see the issue with my solution. My approach was too simplistic and didn't correctly account for how the two joints interact. Let me develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Let's analyze the problem more carefully:

1. We have a 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around the Y-axis
2. The first joint is at the origin
3. The second joint is 0.39225 units above the first joint along the z-axis
4. The TCP is 0.093 units along the y-axis from the second joint

The key insight I missed is that the orientation parameter doesn't directly map to joint2. Instead, I need to solve for both joint angles based on the target position and orientation.

Let me derive the correct solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot with revolute joints around the Y-axis:
    # The forward kinematics equations are:
    # x = L1 * sin(joint1) + 0 * cos(joint1 + joint2)
    # z = L1 * cos(joint1) + 0 * sin(joint1 + joint2)
    
    # Since the TCP is only offset in the y-direction (which is perpendicular to the plane of motion),
    # the x and z coordinates are determined solely by the joint angles
    
    # The orientation around the Y-axis (ry) is determined by the sum of joint1 and joint2
    # ry = joint1 + joint2
    
    # Therefore:
    # joint2 = ry - joint1
    
    # From the position equations:
    # x = L1 * sin(joint1)
    # z = L1 * cos(joint1)
    
    # This gives us:
    # joint1 = atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on the desired orientation
    joint2 = ry - joint1
    
    # Normalize joint2 to be within [-π, π]
    if joint2 > np.pi:
        joint2 -= 2 * np.pi
    elif joint2 < -np.pi:
        joint2 += 2 * np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. The forward kinematics is more complex because the second joint's position depends on the first joint's angle.

Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot:
    # When joint1 rotates, it changes the position and orientation of the second joint
    # When joint2 rotates, it changes the orientation of the end effector
    
    # The orientation around the Y-axis (ry) is determined by the sum of joint1 and joint2
    # ry = joint1 + joint2
    
    # From the position:
    # x = L1 * sin(joint1)
    # z = L1 * cos(joint1)
    
    # This gives us:
    # joint1 = atan2(x/L1, z/L1)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the xz-plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    # The maximum reach of the robot is L1
    if r_xz > L1 + 1e-10:  # Adding a small tolerance
        # If not reachable, project the target onto the reachable circle
        x = x * L1 / r_xz
        z = z * L1 / r_xz
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on the desired orientation
    # The orientation ry is the sum of joint1 and joint2
    joint2 = ry - joint1
    
    # Normalize joint2 to be within [-π, π]
    while joint2 > np.pi:
        joint2 -= 2 * np.pi
    while joint2 < -np.pi:
        joint2 += 2 * np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to be more careful about the relationship between the orientation and joint angles. Let me revise again:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around the Y-axis:
    # The orientation ry represents the rotation around the Y-axis
    # This is the sum of joint1 and joint2 angles
    
    # From the position:
    # x = L1 * sin(joint1)
    # z = L1 * cos(joint1)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on the desired orientation
    # The orientation ry is the sum of joint1 and joint2
    joint2 = ry - joint1
    
    # Normalize joint angles to be within [-π, π]
    while joint1 > np.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * np.pi
    while joint1 < -np.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * np.pi
        
    while joint2 > np.pi:
        joint2 -= 2 * np.pi
    while joint2 < -np.pi:
        joint2 += 2 * np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Based on the feedback and the correct joint values provided, I need to refine my understanding of how the orientation relates to the joint angles. Let me analyze some of the examples:

For the target position [0.23577812417811503, 0.093, -0.313478450071212] and orientation [0, -0.95512450978629, 0], the correct joint values were [2.49672652385058, -3.451851033636871].

Let me revise my solution one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation

    # The orientation ry represents the rotation around the Y-axis
    
    # Calculate joint1 based on the position
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on the desired orientation
    # For a robot with revolute joints around the Y-axis,
    # the final orientation is the sum of all joint angles
    joint2 = ry - joint1
    
    # Normalize joint angles to be within [-π, π]
    while joint1 > np.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * np.pi
