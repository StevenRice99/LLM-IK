I see the results of the forward kinematics test with joint1 = 0.5 and joint2 = 0.3. This helps me understand how the robot's kinematics work. Let me analyze this information to develop the inverse kinematics solution.

From the test results and the provided details, I can observe:

1. The first revolute joint rotates around the Y-axis with orientation [0, joint1, 0]
2. The second revolute joint also rotates around the Y-axis with orientation [0, joint1+joint2, 0]
3. The TCP has the same orientation as the second joint

The existing solution only handles position, but now we need to incorporate orientation as well. The orientation parameter r represents the desired orientation in [x, y, z] format, where y is the rotation around the Y-axis that we need to match.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, calculate theta1 based on the position
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # The total orientation around Y-axis must equal ry
    # Since the total orientation is theta1 + theta2, we can solve for theta2
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    # Verify that this solution also satisfies the position constraint
    # We can adjust if needed
    
    # Calculate the position of the second joint
    joint2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    joint2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint2 to the target position
    dx = x - joint2_x
    dz = z - joint2_z
    
    # The length of this vector should match the distance from joint2 to TCP
    # projected onto the XZ plane (since the TCP is offset in Y)
    tcp_length_xz = 0.093  # This is the projection of the TCP offset onto XZ plane
    
    # Check if the calculated theta2 satisfies the position constraint
    # If not, we need to adjust our approach
    
    # For this specific robot configuration, the orientation directly determines
    # the joint angles, and the position is a result of those angles
    # So we prioritize orientation and return the solution
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this approach. The TCP offset is actually [0, 0.093, 0], which means it's offset in the Y direction, not in the XZ plane. Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # For this robot, the Y component of orientation (ry) represents the total
    # rotation around the Y axis, which is the sum of theta1 and theta2
    
    # First, calculate theta1 based on the position (same as the existing solution)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # The second joint is positioned at:
    joint2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    joint2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # The TCP is offset from the second joint by [0, 0.093, 0] in the local frame
    # This means it's offset perpendicular to the arm in the global frame
    # We need to account for this when calculating theta2
    
    # Since the orientation is ry, and we know theta1, we can calculate theta2
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

I need to verify this solution. Let me think about this more carefully:

The existing solution for position-only inverse kinematics is:
```python
theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
theta2 = theta_total - theta1
```

For the position and orientation inverse kinematics, we need to satisfy both constraints. Since the orientation is directly determined by the sum of joint angles, and we have only 2 DOF, we need to check if we can satisfy both position and orientation simultaneously.

Here's my final solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # The orientation around Y-axis (ry) must equal the sum of joint angles
    # theta1 + theta2 = ry
    
    # First, calculate theta1 based on the position
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate theta2 based on the orientation constraint
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
