I can now see how the forward kinematics works for this 2-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the results and develop the inverse kinematics solution that accounts for both position and orientation.

Based on the forward kinematics tests, I observe:
1. The robot has two revolute joints that rotate around the Y-axis
2. The first link is at the origin, and the second link is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]
3. The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.093, 0] from the second joint
4. The orientation is represented as [roll, pitch, yaw] in radians

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    y_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of the TCP from the second joint
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset in our calculations
    # Since the TCP has a y-offset, we need to adjust the target position
    y_target = y - y_offset
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot with revolute joints around Y-axis:
    # joint1 controls the rotation in the XZ plane
    # joint2 controls the elevation angle
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # For orientation, since both joints rotate around Y-axis,
    # the pitch (rotation around Y) is the sum of joint1 and joint2
    # We know the desired pitch from the orientation parameter
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on the desired pitch
    # pitch = joint1 + joint2 (for Y-axis rotations)
    joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the limits
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The forward kinematics tests show that the orientation is affected by both joints, but my solution doesn't properly account for the position constraints.

Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    y_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of the TCP from the second joint
    
    # For this 2-DOF robot with Y-axis rotations, the pitch component 
    # of the orientation is what we can control
    
    # First, determine joint1 from the position
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint2, we need to consider both position and orientation
    # Since both joints rotate around Y-axis, the final orientation (pitch)
    # is the sum of the two joint angles
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on the desired pitch and position constraints
    # For a 2-DOF robot with revolute joints around Y-axis, the pitch is joint1 + joint2
    joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Verify that this joint2 value satisfies the position constraint
    # The end effector position should be at distance r_xz from the origin in XZ plane
    expected_r_xz = l1 * np.sin(joint2)
    
    # If the calculated joint2 doesn't satisfy the position constraint,
    # we need to prioritize position over orientation
    if not np.isclose(expected_r_xz, r_xz):
        # Calculate joint2 based on position only
        joint2 = np.arcsin(r_xz / l1) if r_xz <= l1 else 0
        if z < 0 and x == 0:
            joint2 = np.pi - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After further analysis, I realize that for a 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around the Y-axis, we cannot independently control both position and orientation. We have to prioritize one over the other.

Here's my final solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    _, pitch, _ = r  # We can only control pitch (rotation around Y-axis)
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    y_offset = 0.093  # Y offset of the TCP from the second joint
    
    # Adjust y for the TCP offset
    y_target = y - y_offset
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate distance in XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on the desired pitch
    # For a 2-DOF robot with Y-axis rotations, pitch = joint1 + joint2
    joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the limits
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
