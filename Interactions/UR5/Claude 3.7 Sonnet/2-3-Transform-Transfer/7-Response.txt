I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the failed test cases and the correct joint values, I need to revise my approach to properly handle both position and orientation constraints.

Let me analyze the correct solutions provided in the feedback:

1. For position [0.23577812417811503, 0.093, -0.313478450071212] and orientation [0, -0.95512450978629, 0], the correct joints were [2.49672652385058, -3.451851033636871]
2. For position [-0.20045369583222, 0.093, -0.337162243329831] and orientation [0, 1.245865627995866, 0], the correct joints were [-2.605203545300474, 3.85106917329634]

I notice that the orientation parameter (specifically the pitch component) is directly related to the joint angles, but my previous solution didn't correctly handle this relationship.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function with a better understanding:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane (joint1)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For a 2-DOF robot with both joints rotating around Y-axis,
    # the orientation is determined by both joint angles
    
    # For this robot, the pitch component of the orientation is related to joint angles
    # Based on the forward kinematics, we can determine:
    # If roll and yaw are 0, then pitch = joint1 + joint2
    # If roll and yaw are π, then pitch = -joint1 - joint2
    
    # Check if roll and yaw are close to π (indicating a flipped orientation)
    orientation_flipped = (np.isclose(abs(roll), np.pi) and np.isclose(abs(yaw), np.pi))
    
    if orientation_flipped:
        # If orientation is flipped, then pitch = -joint1 - joint2
        # So joint2 = -pitch - joint1
        joint2 = -pitch - joint1
    else:
        # If orientation is not flipped, then pitch = joint1 + joint2
        # So joint2 = pitch - joint1
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the limits [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The feedback shows that the orientation handling is more complex than I initially thought. Let me analyze the patterns in the correct solutions more carefully.

Looking at the test cases:
- When orientation is [0, pitch, 0], the correct joint2 seems to be calculated differently than when orientation is [π, pitch, π]
- The position constraint must also be satisfied

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    
    # Calculate the angle in the XZ plane (joint1)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Determine if the orientation is flipped (roll and yaw are π)
    orientation_flipped = (np.isclose(abs(roll), np.pi) and np.isclose(abs(yaw), np.pi))
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on orientation
    if orientation_flipped:
        # If orientation is flipped, then pitch = -joint1 - joint2
        joint2 = -pitch - joint1
    else:
        # If orientation is not flipped, then pitch = joint1 + joint2
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the limits [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

This solution focuses on the orientation constraint. Let's analyze if it will work for all the test cases.

Actually, I need to be more careful with the relationship between position and orientation. For a 2-DOF robot, we can't independently control both. Let me look at the correct solutions again:

For example, in the first test case:
- Position: [0.23577812417811503, 0.093, -0.313478450071212]
- Orientation: [0, -0.95512450978629, 0]
- Correct joints: [2.49672652385058, -3.451851033636871]

The joint1 value (2.49672652385058) matches the arctan2(x, z) calculation.
The joint2 value (-3.451851033636871) seems to be related to both the position and orientation.

Let me revise my solution one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Determine if the orientation is flipped (roll and yaw are π)
    orientation_flipped = (np.isclose(abs(roll), np.pi) and np.isclose(abs(yaw), np.pi))
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on orientation
    if orientation_flipped:
        # If orientation is flipped, then pitch = -joint1 - joint2
        joint2 = -pitch - joint1
    else:
        # If orientation is not flipped, then pitch = joint1 + joint2
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the limits [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
