I see the issue now. Looking at the failed test cases, I notice that my solution is not correctly handling the relationship between orientation and joint angles, particularly when the orientation has roll and yaw values of π.

Let me analyze the patterns more carefully:

1. When orientation is [π, pitch, π], my code is calculating joint2 incorrectly.
2. The relationship between orientation and joint angles seems to be more complex than I initially thought.

Let me look at a specific example:
- Position: [-0.24528730030265603, 0.093, 0.306095087857082]
- Orientation: [3.141592653589793, -0.8305338685051691, 3.141592653589793]
- Correct joints: [-0.675559595453999, -1.635499189630625]
- My joints: [-0.6755595954539997, 1.5060934639591688]

The joint1 value is correct, but joint2 is completely wrong. Let me try to understand the relationship:

For this case:
- joint1 = -0.675559595453999
- joint2 = -1.635499189630625
- pitch = -0.8305338685051691
- roll = yaw = π

If I look at the relationship: pitch = joint1 + joint2 for [0, pitch, 0] orientation
Then for [π, pitch, π] orientation, it seems the relationship is different.

Let me try: pitch = -(joint1 + joint2) for [π, pitch, π] orientation
So: -0.8305338685051691 = -(-0.675559595453999 + (-1.635499189630625))
Which gives: -0.8305338685051691 = -(0.959939594176626)
This doesn't match.

Let me try another approach. Looking at the correct solutions:
- When orientation is [0, pitch, 0], it seems joint2 = pitch - joint1
- When orientation is [π, pitch, π], it seems joint2 is calculated differently

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Determine if the orientation is flipped (roll and yaw are π)
    orientation_flipped = (np.isclose(abs(roll), np.pi) and np.isclose(abs(yaw), np.pi))
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on orientation
    if orientation_flipped:
        # For [π, pitch, π] orientation
        joint2 = -pitch - joint1
        # Add π to joint2 to account for the flipped orientation
        joint2 += np.pi
    else:
        # For [0, pitch, 0] orientation
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the limits [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Let me check this against the example:
- joint1 = -0.675559595453999
- pitch = -0.8305338685051691
- orientation_flipped = True
- joint2 = -(-0.8305338685051691) - (-0.675559595453999) + π
- joint2 = 0.8305338685051691 + 0.675559595453999 + π
- joint2 = 1.5060934639591688 + π
- joint2 = 4.647685817548962
- Normalized to [-π, π]: joint2 = -1.635499489630624

This is very close to the correct value of -1.635499189630625!

Let me revise my solution one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation in XZ plane)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Determine if the orientation is flipped (roll and yaw are π)
    orientation_flipped = (np.isclose(abs(roll), np.pi) and np.isclose(abs(yaw), np.pi))
    
    # Calculate joint2 based on orientation
    if orientation_flipped:
        # For [π, pitch, π] orientation
        joint2 = -pitch - joint1 + np.pi
    else:
        # For [0, pitch, 0] orientation
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to be within the limits [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
