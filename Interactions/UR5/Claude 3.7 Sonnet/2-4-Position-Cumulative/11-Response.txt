I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the feedback, I can see that my inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles, particularly for joint 2. Let me analyze the correct solutions provided in the feedback and develop a better solution.

The key insights from the feedback:
1. Joint 1 values are close but not exact
2. Joint 2 values are completely wrong in my solution
3. Joint 3 should be 0 in all cases (as shown in the correct solutions)

Let me revise my approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.093    # Y offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # The target position is the position of the TCP
    # We need to work backwards to find the position of joint 3
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # The position of joint 2 in world coordinates
    j2_x = L1 * math.sin(theta1)
    j2_z = L1 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # The position of joint 3 in world coordinates (before joint 3 rotation)
    # Note: joint 3 is offset from joint 2 by [0, L2, 0] in local coordinates
    # When transformed to world coordinates, this offset remains [0, L2, 0]
    # because joint 2 rotation is around Y-axis
    
    # The TCP is offset from joint 3 by [0, 0, L3] in local coordinates
    # When transformed to world coordinates, this depends on joint 2 angle
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to the target
    dx = x - j2_x
    dz = z - j2_z
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target in the XZ plane
    dist_xz = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2)
    
    # The effective length from joint 2 to TCP (considering joint 3 and TCP offsets)
    # This is the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by L2 (y-offset) and L3 (z-offset)
    L_eff = math.sqrt(L3**2 + L2**2)
    
    # The angle between the L_eff vector and the z-axis in the local frame of joint 2
    phi = math.atan2(L2, L3)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # We need to find the angle that makes the TCP reach the target
    # This is the angle between the vector from joint 2 to the target
    # and the vector from joint 2 to joint 1
    
    # The angle between the vector from joint 2 to the target and the z-axis
    alpha = math.atan2(dx, dz)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is the difference between alpha and theta1, adjusted by phi
    theta2 = alpha - theta1 - phi
    
    # Joint 3 angle (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 should be 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not getting the geometry right. Let me reconsider the problem:

The robot has:
- Joint 1: Revolute around Y-axis at [0, 0, 0]
- Joint 2: Revolute around Y-axis at [0, 0, 0.39225]
- Joint 3: Revolute around Z-axis at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to joint 2
- TCP: At [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 3

Let me revise my solution again:

```python
import math

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider the full geometry
    # The target position is the end of the chain
    # We need to work backwards to find the position of joint 3
    
    # The effective length from joint 2 to TCP
    L_eff = math.sqrt(L3**2 + L2**2)
    
    # The angle between the L_eff vector and the z-axis in the local frame of joint 2
    phi = math.atan2(L2, L3)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the target in the XZ plane
    dist_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    # We have a triangle with sides L1, L_eff, and dist_xz
    # We want to find the angle opposite to dist_xz
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if dist_xz > L1 + L_eff or dist_xz < abs(L1 - L_eff):
        # Target is not reachable, but we're assuming all targets are reachable
        # So we'll just return a default configuration
        return (theta1, 0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Calculate the angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta = (L1**2 + L_eff**2 - dist_xz**2) / (2 * L1 * L_eff)
    # Clamp to valid range to avoid numerical issues
    cos_theta = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta))
    
    # This is the angle between L1 and L_eff
    angle = math.acos(cos_theta)
    
    # The angle between L1 and the x-axis is theta1 + pi/2
    # The angle between L_eff and the x-axis should be theta1 + pi/2 + angle
    # But we need to adjust by phi because L_eff is not aligned with joint 3
    
    # Calculate the angle of the target in the XZ plane
    target_angle = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the angle between L1 and the target
    beta = target_angle - theta1
    
    # Calculate the angle between L1 and L_eff using the law of sines
    gamma = math.asin(dist_xz * math.sin(beta) / L_eff)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is pi - gamma - phi
    theta2 = math.pi - gamma - phi
    
    # Joint 3 angle (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 should be 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting the geometry right. Let me simplify and try a different approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2y = 0.093   # Y offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3z = 0.09465 # Z offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Since joint 3 doesn't affect the position (it only rotates around Z),
    # we can treat joints 2 and 3 + TCP as a single link with an offset
    
    # The effective endpoint is offset from joint 2 by [0, L2y, L3z] in local coordinates
    # When transformed to world coordinates after joint 2 rotation:
    # - The y-offset remains L2y
    # - The z-offset becomes L3z*cos(theta2)
    # - There's an additional x-offset of L3z*sin(theta2)
    
    # We need to find theta2 such that:
    # x = L1*sin(theta1) + L3z*sin(theta1+theta2)
    # z = L1*cos(theta1) + L3z*cos(theta1+theta2)
    # y = L2y
    
    # Rearranging:
    # x - L1*sin(theta1) = L3z*sin(theta1+theta2)
    # z - L1*cos(theta1) = L3z*cos(theta1+theta2)
    
    # Let's define:
    x_prime = x - L1*math.sin(theta1)
    z_prime = z - L1*math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Now we have:
    # x_prime = L3z*sin(theta1+theta2)
    # z_prime = L3z*cos(theta1+theta2)
    
    # This gives us:
    # theta1+theta2 = atan2(x_prime, z_prime)
    
    # Therefore:
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_prime, z_prime) - theta1
    
    # Joint 3 angle (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 should be 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting it right. Let me try one more approach based on the existing code snippets:

```python

    # adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    # theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    # theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    
    # Calculate the position relative to joint 2
    adjusted_x = x - L1 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - L1 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the total angle in the XZ plane
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is the difference between the total angle and joint 1 angle
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 should be 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
