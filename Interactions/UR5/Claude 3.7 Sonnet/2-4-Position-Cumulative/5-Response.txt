Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure:

1. Joint 1 is a revolute joint rotating around Y-axis at position [0,0,0]
2. Joint 2 is a revolute joint rotating around Y-axis at position [0,0,0.39225]
3. Joint 3 is a revolute joint rotating around Z-axis at position [0,0.093,0] relative to joint 2
4. The TCP is at position [0,0,0.09465] relative to joint 3

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 1 rotates, it affects the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position after joint 1 rotation
    # We need to find the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 2 (also rotating around Y-axis), we need to consider the height (y)
    # and the radial distance (r) from the origin
    # We need to account for the offset caused by L2 and L3
    
    # The effective height we need to reach is y
    # The effective radial distance we need to reach is r
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt((r - L3)**2 + (y - L2)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # For joint 3 (rotating around Z-axis), we need to consider the orientation
    # of the end effector relative to the base
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, it affects the orientation in the XY plane
    
    # The angle of the end effector in the XY plane is determined by joint 3
    # We need to calculate what joint 3 angle will give us the desired position
    
    # First, calculate the angle from joint 2 to the target in the XY plane
    phi = math.atan2(y - L2, r - L3)
    
    # Joint 3 angle is the difference between this angle and the sum of joint 1 and joint 2
    theta3 = phi - (theta1 + theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. The robot structure is more complex than I initially thought. Let me revise:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.093    # Length from joint 2 to joint 3 (y-direction)
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Joint 2 also rotates around Y-axis
    # We need to find what angle will position joint 3 such that the TCP can reach the target
    
    # The position of joint 3 in the robot's coordinate system after joint 1 and joint 2 rotations
    # will be at a distance L1 in the direction determined by joint 2
    
    # For joint 3 (rotating around Z-axis), we need to determine what angle will
    # position the TCP at the target point
    
    # First, we need to determine the position of joint 3 that would allow the TCP to reach the target
    # This is a reverse calculation from the target point
    
    # The TCP is L3 away from joint 3 in the z-direction (after all rotations)
    # We need to account for this offset when calculating joint angles
    
    # Calculate the required position for joint 3
    # This is a complex calculation involving the kinematics of the robot
    
    # Using geometric approach:
    # The distance from origin to target in XZ plane is r
    # The height of the target is y
    
    # For joint 2, we need to determine what angle will position joint 3 correctly
    # This involves solving a triangle with sides L1, and the distance from joint 2 to the target
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2
    # This is the angle that positions joint 3 such that the TCP can reach the target
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + (y - L2)**2 - L1**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L1 * math.sqrt(r**2 + (y - L2)**2))
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # For joint 3, we need to determine what angle will position the TCP at the target
    # This involves calculating the angle between the line from joint 3 to the target
    # and the line from joint 3 to joint 2
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - L2, r - L3) - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a different approach based on the forward kinematics tests:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2 (also rotating around Y-axis) and joint 3 (rotating around Z-axis),
    # we need to solve a more complex problem
    
    # The position after joint 1 rotation in the local frame
    x_local = r
    y_local = y
    z_local = 0  # After rotation, z is 0 in the local frame

    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, affecting the x and y coordinates in its local frame
    
    # We need to solve for these angles to reach the target position
    
    # First, calculate the position of joint 3 in the local frame after joint 2 rotation
    # This depends on the angle of joint 2
    
    # Using geometric approach:

    # And joint 3 has an offset of L2 in the y-direction
    
    # The TCP is at a distance L3 from joint 3 in the z-direction (in joint 3's local frame)
    
    # We need to solve for the angles that position the TCP at the target
    
    # This is a complex inverse kinematics problem that requires solving a system of equations
    
    # For a 3-DOF robot, we can often use a geometric approach
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    # This is r, which we already calculated
    
    # Calculate the height of the target
    # This is y
    
    # For joint 2, we need to determine what angle will position joint 3 correctly
    # For joint 3, we need to determine what angle will position the TCP at the target
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + r**2 - (y - L2)**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L1 * r)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos

    # Calculate the angle for joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - L2, r - L3) - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me try one more approach:

```python

    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane

    x_local = r
    y_local = y
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis, which affects the position of joint 3

    # This is a 2-DOF inverse kinematics problem in the local frame
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)

After careful consideration of the robot structure and the forward kinematics tests, here's my final solution:
