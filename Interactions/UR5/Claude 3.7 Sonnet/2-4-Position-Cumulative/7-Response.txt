Based on the feedback, I can see that my inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles. Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that joint 3 (the Z-axis revolute joint) is always 0 in the correct solutions. Let me revise my approach.

Let's analyze the robot structure again:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0]
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0.39225]
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis at position [0,0.093,0] relative to joint 2
4. The TCP is at position [0,0,0.09465] relative to joint 3

Here's my corrected solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".

    x, y, z = p

    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP (z-direction)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # From the feedback, it appears that joint 3 should always be 0
    # This means the robot is only using joints 1 and 2 to reach the target
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2 (also rotating around Y-axis), we need to determine what angle
    # will position the TCP at the target
    
    # The position of joint 2 is at [0, 0, L1]
    # The position of joint 3 after joint 2 rotation is determined by L1 and theta2

    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 2
    # We need to calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    
    # Since joint 3 is always 0, the TCP is always at a fixed offset from joint 3
    # The TCP is at [0, L2, L1 + L3] in the robot's coordinate system when all joints are 0
    
    # When joint 1 rotates, the TCP moves in the XZ plane
    # When joint 2 rotates, the TCP moves in a circle around joint 2
    
    # We need to calculate what angle of joint 2 will position the TCP at the target
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = math.sqrt((r - 0)**2 + (y - L2)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 2
    # In the triangle formed by joint 2, the target, and the origin
    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + d**2 - (L1 + L3)**2) / (2 * L1 * d)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # The sign of theta2 depends on whether the target is above or below joint 2
    if y >= L2:
        theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    else:
        theta2 = -math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not getting the geometry right. Let me try a different approach:

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try one more approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP (z-direction)
    
    # From the feedback, it appears that joint 3 should always be 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2 (also rotating around Y-axis), we need to determine what angle
    # will position the TCP at the target
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we're working in a 2D plane (the YZ plane in the local frame)
    # The target is at [r, y] in this plane, where r = sqrt(x^2 + z^2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The position of joint 2 is at [0, L1] in this plane
    # The position of joint 3 is at [L2*sin(theta2), L1 + L2*cos(theta2)] in this plane
    # The position of the TCP is at [L2*sin(theta2), L1 + L2*cos(theta2) + L3] in this plane
    
    # We need to solve for theta2 such that the TCP reaches the target [r, y]
    
    # This gives us the equations:
    # L2*sin(theta2) = r
    # L1 + L2*cos(theta2) + L3 = y
    
    # From the first equation:
    # sin(theta2) = r / L2
    
    # From the second equation:
    # cos(theta2) = (y - L1 - L3) / L2
    
    # We can use atan2 to find theta2:
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, y - L1 - L3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After multiple attempts, I'm still not getting the correct solution. Let me try one final approach based on the feedback:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP (z-direction)
    
    # From the feedback, it appears that joint 3 should always be 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2 (also rotating around Y-axis), we need to determine what angle
    # will position the TCP at the target
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we're working in a 2D plane (the YZ plane in the local frame)
    # The target is at [r, y] in this plane, where r = sqrt(x^2 + z^2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Looking at the correct joint values in the feedback, it seems that joint 2
    # is calculated based on the target position
    
    # Let's try a different approach:
    # When joint 2 rotates, it affects the position of joint 3 and the TCP
    
    # The position of joint 3 after joint 2 rotation is:
    # [sin(theta2)*L1, cos(theta2)*L1] in the local frame
    
    # The position of the TCP after joint 3 rotation (which is always 0) is:
    # [sin(theta2)*L1, cos(theta2)*L1 + L3] in the local frame
    
    # We need to solve for theta2 such that the TCP reaches the target [r, y]
    
    # This gives us the equations:
    # sin(theta2)*L1 = r
    # cos(theta2)*L1 + L3 = y

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Based on my analysis of the robot structure and the feedback, here's my final solution:

```python

    """
    x, y, z = p

    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP (z-direction)
    
    # From the feedback, it appears that joint 3 should always be 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2 (also rotating around Y-axis), we need to determine what angle
    # will position the TCP at the target
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we're working in a 2D plane (the YZ plane in the local frame)

    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The position of joint 2 is at [0, L1] in the local frame
