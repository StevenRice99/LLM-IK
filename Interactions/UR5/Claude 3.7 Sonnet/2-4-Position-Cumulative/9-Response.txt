After analyzing the feedback more carefully, I notice that the correct joint values for joint 2 vary significantly from my solution. Looking at the patterns in the correct joint values, I see that joint 2 can be positive or negative, and sometimes it's close to π or even greater than π.

Let me develop a new solution with a better understanding of the robot's kinematics:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3 (y-direction)
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 3 is always 0 based on the feedback
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the total length from joint 2 to TCP
    L_total = math.sqrt(L2**2 + L3**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between L2 and L_total
    alpha = math.atan2(L3, L2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target
    d = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (y - L2)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between L1 and d
    cos_beta = (L1**2 + d**2 - L_total**2) / (2 * L1 * d)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
    
    # Calculate the angle between d and the XZ plane
    gamma = math.atan2(y - L2, r_xz)
    
    # Calculate theta2 based on the angles
    # If the target is above joint 2 (y > L2), theta2 is positive
    # If the target is below joint 2 (y < L2), theta2 is negative
    if y >= L2:
        theta2 = gamma - beta
    else:
        theta2 = gamma + beta
    
    # Adjust theta2 to be in the correct range
    if theta2 > math.pi:
        theta2 = theta2 - 2 * math.pi
    elif theta2 < -math.pi:
        theta2 = theta2 + 2 * math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not getting the geometry right. Let me try a different approach:

    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis

    # After joint 1 rotation, we're working in a 2D plane
