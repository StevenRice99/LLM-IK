Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis
2. The second joint (Revolute 2) also rotates around the Y-axis
3. The third joint (Revolute 3) rotates around the Z-axis
4. The TCP is offset from joint 3 by [0, 0, 0.09465]

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how each joint affects the final position:
- Joint 1 rotation around Y-axis causes the arm to rotate in the XZ plane
- Joint 2 rotation around Y-axis changes the extension of the arm
- Joint 3 rotation around Z-axis doesn't affect the position of the TCP (only orientation)

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in the XZ plane
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    
    # Calculate the position relative to joint 2
    # We need to find the angle that joint 2 needs to rotate to reach the target
    # First, transform the target point to be relative to joint 2
    x2 = x - L1 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = z - L1 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target in the XZ plane
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the total angle in the XZ plane
    theta_total = math.atan2(x2, z2)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is the difference between the total angle and joint 1 angle
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Since joint 3 rotation doesn't affect the position of the TCP,
    # we can set it to any value. However, based on the existing code 5,
    # it seems the intention is to align with the Y-axis of the target.
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Looking at the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 3 rotates around the Z-axis, which means it can affect the Y position of the TCP.
2. The TCP is offset from joint 3 by [0, 0, 0.09465] in the local frame.

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in the XZ plane
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.093    # Y offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, it doesn't affect the position in the XZ plane
    # So we can calculate joint 2 angle directly
    x2 = x - L1 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = z - L1 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the total angle in the XZ plane
    theta_total = math.atan2(x2, z2)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is the difference between the total angle and joint 1 angle
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # For joint 3, we need to consider the Y position
    # The Y position is determined by joint 3 rotation
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the Y position is L2 (0.093)
    # We need to solve for theta3 to get the desired Y position
    
    # Since joint 3 doesn't affect X and Z, we can use the Y position directly
    # If y = L2, then theta3 = 0
    # If y â‰  L2, then we need to calculate theta3
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This is a simplification - in reality, we would need to consider the full kinematics
    theta3 = 0  # Default value
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Looking at the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When joint 3 is rotated (test with 0, 0, 1.57), the TCP position doesn't change.
2. This means joint 3 only affects orientation, not position.

Let me finalize the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    
    # Transform the target point to be relative to joint 2
    x2 = x - L1 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = z - L1 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the total angle in the XZ plane
    theta_total = math.atan2(x2, z2)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is the difference between the total angle and joint 1 angle
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Since joint 3 doesn't affect the position, we can set it to 0
    # or any other value depending on the desired orientation
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
