I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the feedback, I can see that my approach was incorrect. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback to understand the proper inverse kinematics solution.

The main issues with my previous solution:
1. I didn't properly account for the link lengths and offsets
2. Joint 2 calculation was completely wrong
3. I didn't consider how joint 2 affects the position of the end effector

Let me develop a correct solution by analyzing the robot structure more carefully:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Calculate the projection in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider the geometry more carefully
    # The target position is affected by both joint 2 and the TCP offset
    
    # First, we need to determine the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # The TCP is offset from joint 3 by l3 in the direction determined by joint 2
    
    # We need to solve for the angle that positions joint 3 such that 
    # after applying the TCP offset, we reach the target
    
    # The distance from the base to the target in the X-Z plane
    # We need to account for the fact that joint 2 rotates around Y
    # and affects both the height and the distance in the X-Z plane
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle
    # The triangle is formed by:
    # - Side 1: l1 (vertical distance from base to joint 2)
    # - Side 2: Distance from joint 2 to TCP (sqrt(l2^2 + l3^2))
    # - Side 3: Distance from base to target (sqrt(r^2 + y^2))
    
    side1 = l1
    side2 = math.sqrt(l2**2 + l3**2)
    side3 = math.sqrt(r**2 + y**2)
    
    # Using law of cosines: cos(angle) = (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) / (2*a*b)
    # We want the angle between side1 and side2
    cos_angle = (side1**2 + side2**2 - side3**2) / (2 * side1 * side2)
    
    # Ensure cos_angle is within valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_angle = max(-1, min(1, cos_angle))
    
    # Calculate the angle
    angle = math.acos(cos_angle)
    
    # Adjust the angle based on whether the target is above or below joint 2
    if y < l1:
        theta2 = -angle
    else:
        theta2 = angle
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This doesn't affect position, so we can set it to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not accounting for the geometry correctly. Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of link 2 (y-direction) 
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider that:
    # - Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
    # - Joint 3 is offset by l2 in the y-direction from joint 2
    # - TCP is offset by l3 in the z-direction from joint 3
    
    # We need to find the angle that positions the arm such that the TCP reaches the target
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z and doesn't affect position, we can work backwards
    
    # The effective length of the second link (from joint 2 to TCP)
    effective_length = math.sqrt(l2**2 + l3**2)
    
    # The angle of the effective link relative to the horizontal
    effective_angle = math.atan2(l2, l3)
    
    # The distance from the base to the target
    target_distance = math.sqrt(r**2 + (y - l1)**2)
    
    # The angle between the vertical and the line from base to target
    target_angle = math.atan2(r, y - l1)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + effective_length**2 - target_distance**2) / (2 * l1 * effective_length)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta2 is within valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # We need to adjust by effective_angle to account for the offset of joint 3
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2) - effective_angle
    
    # Adjust the sign of theta2 based on whether the target is in front or behind
    if r < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This doesn't affect position, so we can set it to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a different approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2
    j2_pos = [0, 0, l1]
    
    # Calculate the position of the target in the plane defined by joint 2 and the target
    # We need to rotate the target by -theta1 around the Y-axis to get it in the same plane
    x_rotated = x * math.cos(-theta1) - z * math.sin(-theta1)
    z_rotated = x * math.sin(-theta1) + z * math.cos(-theta1)
    target_in_plane = [x_rotated, y, z_rotated]
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to the target
    vec_to_target = [
        target_in_plane[0] - j2_pos[0],
        target_in_plane[1] - j2_pos[1],
        target_in_plane[2] - j2_pos[2]
    ]
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    dist_to_target = math.sqrt(vec_to_target[0]**2 + vec_to_target[1]**2 + vec_to_target[2]**2)
    
    # Calculate the effective length of the arm from joint 2 to TCP
    effective_length = math.sqrt(l2**2 + l3**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the z-axis and the vector to the target
    angle_to_target = math.atan2(math.sqrt(vec_to_target[0]**2 + vec_to_target[1]**2), vec_to_target[2])
    
    # Calculate the angle between the effective arm and the z-axis
    angle_of_arm = math.atan2(l2, l3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = angle_to_target - angle_of_arm
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This doesn't affect position, so we can set it to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful analysis of the robot structure and the feedback, I believe the following solution is correct:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # We need to find the angle of joint 2 that positions the TCP at the target
    # First, we need to account for the offset of joint 3 and the TCP
    
    # The effective length from joint 2 to TCP
    effective_length = math.sqrt(l2**2 + l3**2)
    
    # The angle of the effective link relative to the z-axis
    effective_angle = math.atan2(l2, l3)

    target_distance = math.sqrt(r**2 + (y - 0)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    # We have a triangle with sides: l1, effective_length, and target_distance
    
    # Calculate the angle between l1 and target_distance
    alpha = math.atan2(r, y)
    
    # Calculate the angle between l1 and effective_length using the law of cosines
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + effective_length**2 - target_distance**2) / (2 * l1 * effective_length)
    cos_beta = max(-1, min(1, cos_beta))  # Ensure it's within valid range
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # We need to adjust by effective_angle and consider the orientation
    theta2 = math.pi - beta - effective_angle

    if y < 0:
