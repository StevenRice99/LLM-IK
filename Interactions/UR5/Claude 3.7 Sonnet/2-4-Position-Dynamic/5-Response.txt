I'll analyze the robot structure and develop the inverse kinematics solution step by step.

Based on the FORWARD_KINEMATICS results and the robot description, I can see:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints:
   - Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis at [0,0,0]
   - Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis at [0,0,0.39225]
   - Joint 3: Rotates around Z-axis at [0,0.093,0.39225]
   - TCP (end effector) is at [0,0.093,0.4869] when all joints are at 0

2. The forward kinematics shows how joint angles affect the final TCP position.

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the projection on the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the angle that positions the third joint correctly
    # to reach the target with the final link
    
    # The position after joint 2 but before joint 3 in the XZ plane
    # needs to be at distance l2 from the target in the Y direction
    # and at distance l3 in the XZ plane direction
    
    # Calculate the position that joint 3 needs to be at
    # This is the target position minus the effect of link 3
    # Link 3 extends in the direction determined by joint 3 rotation
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, we need to account for this
    
    # For simplification, we'll solve for joint 2 and 3 in the plane defined by joint 1
    # Transform the target point to this plane
    x_prime = r
    y_prime = y
    z_prime = l1
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt((x_prime)**2 + (z_prime - l1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This is the angle needed to orient the end effector to reach the target
    # We need to find the angle between the XZ plane and the target
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_prime - l2, x_prime)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The robot structure is more complex than I initially thought. Let me revise:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the projection on the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
    
    # The position of joint 3 in the robot's coordinate system
    # when all joints are at 0 is [0, l2, l1]
    
    # We need to find joint angles such that the TCP reaches position p
    # The TCP is at [0, l2, l1+l3] when all joints are at 0
    
    # For joint 2, we need to rotate around Y to get the correct height (z)
    # For joint 3, we need to rotate around Z to get the correct y position
    
    # Calculate the position that joint 3 needs to be at
    # This is the target position minus the effect of link 3
    
    # Since joint 1 rotates around Y, it affects x and z
    # We need to account for this rotation
    
    # Transform the target to the coordinate system after joint 1 rotation
    x_rot = x * math.cos(-theta1) - z * math.sin(-theta1)
    z_rot = x * math.sin(-theta1) + z * math.cos(-theta1)
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 and 3 angles to reach this transformed target
    # Joint 2 affects the z position
    # Joint 3 affects the y position
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Y)
    theta2 = math.atan2(l1 - z_rot, x_rot)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Z)
    # This is the angle needed to orient the end effector to reach the target y
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - l2, 0)  # Simplified
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a different approach:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at origin
    # This rotation affects the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we need to find joint 2 and 3 angles
    # to reach the target position
    
    # Transform the target to the coordinate system after joint 1 rotation
    c1 = math.cos(theta1)
    s1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_1 = c1*x + s1*z
    z_1 = -s1*x + c1*z
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at [0, 0, l1]
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis at [0, l2, l1]
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_1, z_1 - l1)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle
    # After joint 2 rotation, we need to find the angle to reach the target y
    c2 = math.cos(theta2)
    s2 = math.sin(theta2)
    
    # Position after joint 2 rotation
    x_2 = s2*(z_1 - l1) + c2*x_1
    z_2 = c2*(z_1 - l1) - s2*x_1
    
    # Joint 3 needs to rotate to reach the target y
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - l2, l3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me provide a more accurate implementation:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the height and distance in the XZ plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(r - l3, l1)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This affects the y-coordinate
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - l2, 0)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful consideration of the robot structure and the forward kinematics results, here's my final solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the angle that positions joint 3 correctly
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, l1) - math.atan2(l3, l2)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This is the angle needed to orient the end effector to reach the target y
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, l3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```
