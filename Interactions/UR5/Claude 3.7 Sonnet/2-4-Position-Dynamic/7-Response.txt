I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the failed test cases and the correct joint values, I notice that:

1. My solution is calculating joint1 (theta1) somewhat correctly but not perfectly
2. My solution is setting joint2 (theta2) to 0 in all cases, which is incorrect
3. My solution is setting joint3 (theta3) to 0 in all cases, which appears to be correct based on the expected values

Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at origin
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at [0, 0, 0.39225]
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis at [0, 0.093, 0.39225]
4. TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.4869] when all joints are at 0

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that joint3 is always 0. This suggests that we don't need to use joint3 to reach the target positions, which makes sense since all target positions have y=0.093, which is exactly the y-offset of the TCP when joint3 is 0.

Let me revise my solution to focus on calculating joint1 and joint2 correctly:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p

    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Since all target positions have y=0.093 (which is exactly l2),
    # we can set joint3 to 0 for all cases
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # For joint1 and joint2, we need to solve the inverse kinematics
    # to reach the target position [x, y, z] with joint3=0
    
    # The position of the TCP when joint3=0 is determined by joint1 and joint2
    # Joint1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    # Joint2 rotates around Y-axis, also affecting x and z
    
    # We need to find joint1 and joint2 such that:

    # TCP_z = z
    
    # When joint3=0, the TCP is at a distance of l3 from joint3 in the direction
    # determined by joint1 and joint2
    
    # Calculate the position of joint3 (which is the origin of the TCP)
    # by subtracting the effect of link3
    # Since joint3=0, link3 extends in the direction determined by joint1 and joint2
    
    # First, calculate the direction vector from the origin to the target
    dir_x = x
    dir_z = z
    dir_length = math.sqrt(dir_x**2 + dir_z**2)
    
    if dir_length > 0:
        # Normalize the direction vector
        dir_x /= dir_length
        dir_z /= dir_length
        
        # Calculate the position of joint3
        joint3_x = x - l3 * dir_x
        joint3_z = z - l3 * dir_z
    else:
        # If the target is directly above/below the origin,
        # joint3 is directly above/below as well
        joint3_x = 0
        joint3_z = z - l3 if z > 0 else z + l3
    
    # Now we need to find joint1 and joint2 to position joint3 at [joint3_x, l2, joint3_z]
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Y-axis at origin)
    theta1 = math.atan2(joint3_x, joint3_z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to joint3 in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(joint3_x**2 + joint3_z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Y-axis at [0, 0, l1])
    # We need to find the angle that positions joint3 at distance r from the origin
    # and at height joint3_z
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between link1 and the line from origin to joint3
    cos_angle = (l1**2 + r**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    # Clamp to valid range
    cos_angle = max(min(cos_angle, 1.0), -1.0)
    angle = math.acos(cos_angle)
    
    # Calculate theta2 based on the angle and the direction of joint3
    if joint3_z >= l1:
        theta2 = angle
    else:
        theta2 = -angle
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not getting the geometry right. Let me revise again:
