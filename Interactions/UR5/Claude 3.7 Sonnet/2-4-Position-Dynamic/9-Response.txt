Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
4. The link lengths and positions match the details provided

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see:
- When joint 1 is at 1.57 (90 degrees), the end effector moves primarily in the X direction
- When joint 2 is at 1.57 (90 degrees), the end effector's Z position changes
- Joint 3 rotation doesn't affect the position of the TCP (only orientation)

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the end effector in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust r to account for the y-offset of link 2
    # The distance from the origin to the projection of the end effector
    # minus the y-offset of link 2
    r_adjusted = r - l2
    
    # Joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the height (Z) of the end effector
    # Using the adjusted distance and the height difference
    height_diff = y - l3
    theta2 = math.atan2(height_diff, r_adjusted)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint doesn't affect the position of the end effector
    # We can set it to 0 or any other value as needed
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at height 0.39225
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis with offset (0, 0.093, 0) from joint 2
4. TCP is at offset (0, 0, 0.09465) from joint 3

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to solve for the angle that positions the end of link 2
    # such that after applying joint 3 and the TCP offset, we reach the target
    
    # The y-coordinate is affected by both joint 2 and the TCP offset
    # The r-coordinate (in X-Z plane) is affected by joint 2 and the TCP offset
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z and doesn't affect position, we can
    # directly solve for joint 2
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by l3 in the direction determined by joint 2
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    theta2 = math.atan2(y - l2, r - l3)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint doesn't affect the position of the end effector
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it one more time with a clearer understanding of the robot's kinematics:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, determining the orientation in X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection distance in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The position after joint 2 but before joint 3 is at:
    # - height: l1 (0.39225)
    # - y-offset: l2 (0.093)
    # - distance in X-Z plane: determined by theta2
    
    # The TCP adds an additional offset of l3 (0.09465) in the Z direction
    # relative to joint 3
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, it doesn't affect the position
    # We need to solve for theta2 to reach the target position
    
    # Calculate theta2 based on the target position
    # This is a simplification and may need adjustment
    theta2 = math.atan2(y - 0.093, r - 0.09465)
    
    # Joint 3 doesn't affect position
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further consideration, I realize I need a more precise approach. Let me provide the final solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to determine the angle that positions the arm
    # such that the TCP reaches the target position
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, it doesn't affect the position
    # We can solve for joint 2 directly
    
    # The height difference from the base of joint 2 to the target
    height_diff = y - l1
    
    # The radial distance in the X-Z plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(height_diff, r)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This doesn't affect position, so we can set it to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```
