I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the feedback, I notice that my inverse kinematics solution is not correctly handling the joint2 calculation, and in many cases, it's setting joint2 to 0 or not calculating it properly. Let me revise the solution with a more accurate approach.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2 and 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (Z direction when joint2=0)
    
    # Joint 3 doesn't affect the position, so we can set it to 0
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the X-Z plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint2
    # cos(joint2) = (r^2 - l1^2 - l3^2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    cos_joint2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for joint2 (elbow up or down)
    # We'll choose the solution that makes the most sense based on the target position
    joint2 = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    
    # For some positions, we might need the negative solution
    # Let's determine which solution to use based on the target position
    # If z is negative and x is positive, we might need the negative solution
    if z < 0 and x > 0:
        joint2 = -joint2
    
    # Calculate joint1
    # We need to find the angle to the target point and adjust by the angle of the second link
    beta = np.arctan2(x, z)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(joint2), l1 + l3 * np.cos(joint2))
    joint1 = beta - alpha
    
    # Ensure the joints are within their limits
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider the solution more carefully. Looking at the feedback, I see that the correct joint values vary significantly, and my simple heuristic for choosing between positive and negative joint2 values isn't sufficient.

Let me revise the solution again:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2 and 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (Z direction when joint2=0)
    
    # Joint 3 doesn't affect the position, so we can set it to 0
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from the origin to the target in the X-Z plane
    r_squared = x**2 + z**2
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint2
    cos_joint2 = (r_squared - l1**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Calculate both possible solutions for joint2
    joint2_pos = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    joint2_neg = -joint2_pos
    
    # Calculate the corresponding joint1 values for both joint2 solutions
    # For positive joint2
    alpha_pos = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(joint2_pos), l1 + l3 * np.cos(joint2_pos))
    beta = np.arctan2(x, z)
    joint1_pos = beta - alpha_pos
    
    # For negative joint2
    alpha_neg = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(joint2_neg), l1 + l3 * np.cos(joint2_neg))
    joint1_neg = beta - alpha_neg
    
    # Choose the solution that keeps both joints within their limits
    # and minimizes the total joint movement (assuming starting from zero)
    
    # Normalize angles to [-pi, pi]
    joint1_pos = ((joint1_pos + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2_pos = ((joint2_pos + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint1_neg = ((joint1_neg + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2_neg = ((joint2_neg + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    # Calculate the total joint movement for both solutions
    # We'll use the solution with the smaller total movement
    movement_pos = abs(joint1_pos) + abs(joint2_pos)
    movement_neg = abs(joint1_neg) + abs(joint2_neg)
    
    if movement_pos <= movement_neg:
        return (joint1_pos, joint2_pos, joint3)
    else:
        return (joint1_neg, joint2_neg, joint3)
```

Looking at the feedback more carefully, I see that the correct solutions have a wide range of joint2 values, including both positive and negative values. Let me refine the solution one more time:

    joint3 = 0.0

    r_squared = x**2 + z**2
