Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the equations.

From the tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis and affects the X and Z coordinates
2. Joint 2 also rotates around the Y-axis and affects the X and Z coordinates
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Z-axis but doesn't change the end-effector position

Let me derive the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # The y-coordinate is fixed by the robot structure and only depends on l2
    # If the target y is not equal to l2, we need to use joint 3 to reach it
    
    # For joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis), it doesn't affect the position
    # So we can set it to 0 for the simplest solution
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # The remaining task is to solve for theta1 and theta2 to reach the x and z coordinates
    
    # We need to find the position of the wrist center (before the last link)
    # The wrist center is at the position of joint 3
    # Since joint 3 doesn't affect position, the wrist center is at:
    # [x, y, z - l3]
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_z = z - l3
    
    # Now we need to solve for theta1 and theta2 to reach the wrist center
    # This is a 2-DOF planar robot problem in the X-Z plane
    
    # The distance from the origin to the wrist center in the X-Z plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Finding theta1 using atan2
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Adjust theta1 based on theta2 to ensure the end-effector reaches the target
    if wrist_z < 0:
        theta1 = theta1 - theta2
    else:
        theta1 = theta1 + theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.4869]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57, the TCP moves to [0.4869, 0.093, 0.00039]
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP moves to [0.0946, 0.093, 0.3923]
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP position doesn't change

This confirms that joint 3 doesn't affect the position. Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (z-direction)
    
    # Since joint 3 doesn't affect position, we can set it to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # The y-coordinate is fixed by the robot structure
    # If the target y is not equal to l2, it's not reachable
    # But we're assuming all targets are reachable
    
    # For joints 1 and 2 (both rotate around Y-axis), we need to solve for x and z
    
    # The distance from the origin to the target in the X-Z plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + (z - l1)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l3 * r)
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Finding theta1 using atan2
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z - l1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to reconsider again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

The robot has 3 revolute joints:
1. Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis at [0,0,0]
2. Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis at [0,0,0.39225]
3. Joint 3: Rotates around Z-axis at [0,0.093,0.39225]
4. TCP: Located at [0,0.093,0.4869] when all joints are at 0

Let me complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".

    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z and doesn't affect the position of the TCP
    # relative to joint 3, we can set it to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # The position of the TCP relative to joint 2 when theta3 = 0 is [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
    # So we need to solve for theta1 and theta2 to position joint 2 such that
    # the TCP reaches the target position
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 needed to reach the target
    j2_x = x

    # Joint 1 is at the origin and rotates around Y
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0, 0.39225] when theta1 = 0
    
    # First, find theta1 (rotation around Y at the base)
    # This determines the plane in which joint 2 will lie
    theta1 = np.arctan2(j2_x, j2_z)
    
    # Now find theta2 (rotation around Y at joint 1)
    # The distance from joint 1 to joint 2 is 0.39225
    # After rotating by theta1, joint 2 should be at the correct position
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target joint 2 position in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(j2_x**2 + j2_z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - 0.39225**2) / (2 * 0.39225 * r)
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # The sign of theta2 depends on whether we want the elbow up or down
    # We'll choose the solution that keeps the arm above the XY plane when possible
    if j2_z >= 0:
        theta2 = -np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    else:
        theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)

I'm still not satisfied with my solution. Let me analyze the robot structure one more time and derive the correct equations:
