Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the equations.

From the tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis and affects the X and Z coordinates
2. Joint 2 also rotates around the Y-axis and affects the X and Z coordinates
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Z-axis but doesn't change the end-effector position

Let me derive the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (Y direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (Z direction)
    
    # For joint 3, we know it doesn't affect the position, so we can set it to any value
    # within its limits. Let's set it to 0 for simplicity.
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # The position of the end effector before joint 3 rotation is the same as the target position
    # since joint 3 doesn't change the position
    
    # For joints 1 and 2, we need to solve for the X and Z coordinates
    # The Y coordinate is fixed by the geometry (l2)
    
    # Check if the target Y coordinate matches the fixed Y coordinate
    if not np.isclose(y, l2):
        # If not, the target is not reachable with this robot configuration
        # But the problem statement says all targets will be reachable, so we'll proceed
        pass
    
    # The X and Z coordinates are determined by joints 1 and 2
    # We have:
    # x = l1*sin(joint1) + l3*sin(joint1 + joint2)
    # z = l1*cos(joint1) + l3*cos(joint1 + joint2)
    
    # This is a 2-link planar manipulator problem in the X-Z plane
    
    # Calculate the coordinates relative to the base of joint 2
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + (z - l1)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint2
    cos_joint2 = (x**2 + (z - l1)**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)
    joint2 = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    # We need to find the angle to the target point and adjust by the angle of the second link
    phi = np.arctan2(x, z - l1)
    psi = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(joint2), l1 + l3 * np.cos(joint2))
    joint1 = phi - psi
    
    # Ensure the joints are within their limits
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Looking at the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When joint1 = 1.57 (90 degrees), the TCP moves primarily in the X direction
2. When joint2 = 1.57 (90 degrees), the TCP moves in the X direction but less than joint1
3. Joint3 doesn't affect the position

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (Z direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (Z direction when joint2=0)
    
    # Joint 3 doesn't affect the position, so we can set it to 0
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # The Y coordinate is fixed by the geometry
    if not np.isclose(y, l2):
        # If not, the target is not reachable with this robot configuration
        # But the problem statement says all targets will be reachable, so we'll proceed
        pass
    
    # We need to solve for joint1 and joint2 to reach the X and Z coordinates
    # From the forward kinematics tests:
    # When all joints are 0: TCP = [0, 0.093, 0.4869]
    # When joint1 = 1.57: TCP ≈ [0.487, 0.093, 0.0004]
    # When joint2 = 1.57: TCP ≈ [0.095, 0.093, 0.392]
    
    # This is a 2-link planar robot in the X-Z plane
    # The effective lengths are l1 and l3
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the X-Z plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint2
    cos_joint2 = (x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # There are two possible solutions for joint2 (elbow up or down)
    # We'll choose the elbow up configuration
    joint2 = np.arccos(cos_joint2)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    beta = np.arctan2(x, z)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(joint2), l1 + l3 * np.cos(joint2))
    joint1 = beta - alpha
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Looking at the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.4869]
2. When joint1 = 1.57, the TCP is at [0.487, 0.093, 0.0004] - this rotates around Y
3. When joint2 = 1.57, the TCP is at [0.095, 0.093, 0.392] - this also rotates around Y
4. When joint3 = 1.57, the TCP is still at [0, 0.093, 0.4869] - no change in position

Let me provide the final solution:

```python

    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2 and 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (Z direction when joint2=0)
    
    # Joint 3 doesn't affect the position, so we can set it to 0
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # The Y coordinate should be l2
    if not np.isclose(y, l2):
        # If not, the target is not reachable with this robot configuration
        # But the problem statement says all targets will be reachable, so we'll proceed

    alpha = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(joint2), l1 + l3 * np.cos(joint2))
    joint1 = beta - alpha
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
