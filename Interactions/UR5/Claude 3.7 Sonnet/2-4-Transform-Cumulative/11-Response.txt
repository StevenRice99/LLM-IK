Thank you for the additional feedback. I see that my solution is still not working correctly. After analyzing the failures and the correct joint values, I notice that my approach to calculating joint 2 is fundamentally flawed.

Let me develop a more accurate solution by carefully analyzing the robot's kinematics and the correct joint values provided:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """

    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Create rotation matrices
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([[1, 0, 0], 
                         [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)],

    # Target rotation matrix
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Calculate TCP position in world frame
    tcp_pos = np.array([x, y, z])
    
    # Calculate wrist position by subtracting the TCP offset transformed by the target orientation
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0, 0.09465])
    wrist_pos = tcp_pos - R_target @ tcp_offset
    
    # Joint 1 calculation (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_pos[0], wrist_pos[2])

    R1 = rot_y(theta1)
    
    # Transform the target orientation to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    R_after_j1 = R1.T @ R_target
    
    # Transform wrist position to joint 1 frame
    wrist_in_j1 = R1.T @ wrist_pos
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in joint 1 frame
    joint2_pos_in_j1 = np.array([0, 0, 0.39225])
    
    # Vector from joint 2 to wrist in joint 1 frame
    j2_to_wrist = wrist_in_j1 - joint2_pos_in_j1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist
    dist_j2_to_wrist = np.linalg.norm(j2_to_wrist)
    
    # The length of the link from joint 2 to joint 3 (in the XZ plane)
    link2_length = 0.093  # This is the Y offset of joint 3
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # This is more complex than I initially thought
    # Looking at the correct values, joint 2 seems to be related to both position and orientation
    
    # First, let's try to extract the pitch component from the orientation after joint 1
    sin_pitch = -R_after_j1[2, 0]
    cos_pitch = math.sqrt(R_after_j1[0, 0]**2 + R_after_j1[1, 0]**2)
    pitch = math.atan2(sin_pitch, cos_pitch)
    
    # Now, let's calculate the angle needed to reach the wrist position
    pos_angle = math.atan2(j2_to_wrist[0], j2_to_wrist[2])
    
    # Joint 2 angle is a combination of position and orientation requirements
    # Based on the examples, it seems we need to use the orientation angle
    theta2 = pitch
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 2
    R2 = rot_y(theta2)
    
    # Transform the target orientation to the frame after joint 1 and joint 2 rotations
    R_after_j2 = R2.T @ R_after_j1
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, so we extract the rotation around Z
    theta3 = math.atan2(R_after_j2[1, 0], R_after_j2[0, 0])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the correct joint values, I see that my approach is still not capturing the relationship correctly. Let me try a different approach:

    # Specifically, it's related to the pitch component of the orientation

After analyzing the examples more carefully, I see that my understanding of the robot's kinematics is still incomplete. Let me try a more comprehensive approach:
