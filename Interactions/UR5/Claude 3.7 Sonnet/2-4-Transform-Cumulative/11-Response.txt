I see that my solution is still not correctly calculating the joint angles. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the robot structure:
1. Joint 1: Revolute around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2: Revolute around Y-axis at z=0.39225
3. Joint 3: Revolute around Z-axis with offset [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2
4. TCP: Offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3

Let me implement a more accurate solution:

```python

After analyzing the failed test cases more carefully, I need to revise my approach. Let me implement a solution that better matches the expected joint values:
