Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at z=0.39225
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis at offset [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2
4. The TCP is at offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # The TCP is at offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 first
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, it affects the yaw (r[2])
    # The TCP orientation is directly determined by joint 3's angle
    joint3 = yaw
    
    # Now we need to find the position of joint 3
    # We know the TCP is at offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3
    # We need to account for the rotation of joint 3 when calculating this offset
    c3 = np.cos(joint3)
    s3 = np.sin(joint3)
    
    # Rotation matrix for joint 3 (around Z-axis)
    R3 = np.array([
        [c3, -s3, 0],
        [s3, c3, 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # TCP offset in joint 3 frame
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0, 0.09465])
    
    # Calculate joint 3 position by subtracting the rotated TCP offset from TCP position
    j3_pos = np.array([x, y, z]) - R3 @ tcp_offset
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 1 and joint 2
    # Joint 1 and 2 form a 2-DOF arm in the Y-Z plane when viewed from the side
    
    # The position of joint 2 is at [0, 0, 0.39225] from the base
    # Joint 3 is at offset [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in the base frame
    # We need to account for the y-offset of joint 3 from joint 2
    j2_to_j3_offset = np.array([0, 0.093, 0])
    
    # Calculate joint 2 position
    j2_pos = j3_pos - j2_to_j3_offset
    
    # Now we can solve for joint 1 and joint 2
    # Joint 1 determines the orientation in the X-Z plane
    joint1 = np.arctan2(j2_pos[0], j2_pos[2])
    
    # For joint 2, we need to find the angle that places joint 2 at the correct height
    # The distance from base to joint 2 is 0.39225
    # We need to find the angle that gives us the correct projection in the direction of joint 1
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    xz_dist = np.sqrt(j2_pos[0]**2 + j2_pos[2]**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    joint2 = np.arctan2(xz_dist - 0.39225, j2_pos[1])
    
    # Adjust joint 2 to account for the orientation
    # This is similar to the approach in EXISTING 2
    orientation_flipped = np.isclose(abs(roll), np.pi) and np.isclose(abs(yaw), np.pi)
    
    if orientation_flipped:
        joint2 = -pitch - joint1
        joint2 += np.pi
    else:
        joint2 = pitch - joint1
    
    # Normalize angles to [-π, π]
    joint1 = (joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi
    joint2 = (joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi
    joint3 = (joint3 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at z=0.39225
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis with offset [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2
4. TCP is at offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3

Let me revise the solution:

    # The TCP offset is [0, 0, 0.09465] in the joint 3 frame

    c3 = np.cos(joint3)
    s3 = np.sin(joint3)

    # Position of joint 2
    j2_x = j3_x
    j2_y = j3_y - 0.093
    j2_z = j3_z
    
    # Joint 1 determines the rotation in the X-Z plane
