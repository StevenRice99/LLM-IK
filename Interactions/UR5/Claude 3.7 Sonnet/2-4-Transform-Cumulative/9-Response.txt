Thank you for the feedback. I can see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the failures and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

The main issues appear to be:

1. The approach for calculating joint 2 is incorrect
2. There are issues with handling the full 3D orientation properly
3. The solution doesn't account for multiple possible configurations

Let me develop a corrected solution:

```python

    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Create rotation matrices
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([[1, 0, 0], 
                         [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, 1, 0], 
                         [-np.sin(angle), 0, np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle), 0], 
                         [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle), 0], 
                         [0, 0, 1]])
    
    # Target rotation matrix
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Calculate TCP position in world frame
    tcp_pos = np.array([x, y, z])
    
    # Calculate wrist position by subtracting the TCP offset transformed by the target orientation
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0, 0.09465])
    wrist_pos = tcp_pos - R_target @ tcp_offset
    
    # Joint 1 calculation (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_pos[0], wrist_pos[2])
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in world frame
    joint2_pos = np.array([0, 0, 0.39225])
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to wrist in joint 1 frame
    R1 = rot_y(theta1)
    wrist_in_j1 = R1.T @ wrist_pos
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to wrist
    j2_to_wrist = wrist_in_j1 - np.array([0, 0, 0.39225])
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist
    dist_j2_to_wrist = np.linalg.norm(j2_to_wrist)
    
    # The length of the link from joint 2 to joint 3
    link2_length = 0.093  # This is the Y offset of joint 3
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using the law of cosines
    # We need to consider the angle between the Z-axis and the vector from joint 2 to wrist
    cos_theta2 = j2_to_wrist[2] / dist_j2_to_wrist
    theta2 = math.acos(max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2)))
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the X component of the wrist position in joint 1 frame
    if j2_to_wrist[0] < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle
    # First, transform the target orientation to the frame after joint 1 and joint 2 rotations
    R2 = rot_y(theta2)
    R_after_j2 = R2.T @ R1.T @ R_target
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, so we extract the rotation around Z
    theta3 = math.atan2(R_after_j2[1, 0], R_after_j2[0, 0])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Looking at the failed examples and the correct joint values, I see that my understanding of the robot's kinematics is incomplete.

Let me revise the solution:

        return np.array([[1, 0, 0], 
                         [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_y(angle):

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After analyzing the failed examples more carefully, I see that my approach still has issues. Let me revise it one more time:

    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p

        return np.array([[1, 0, 0], 
                         [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)],

    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, 1, 0], 
                         [-np.sin(angle), 0, np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle), 0],

                         [0, 0, 1]])
    
    # Target rotation matrix
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Joint 1 calculation (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 1
    R1 = rot_y(theta1)
    
    # Transform the target orientation to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    R_after_j1 = R1.T @ R_target
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    # From the examples, it seems joint 2 is related to the pitch component of the orientation
    # Extract the pitch angle from the rotation matrix after joint 1
    sin_pitch = -R_after_j1[2, 0]
    cos_pitch = math.sqrt(1 - sin_pitch**2)
    pitch = math.atan2(sin_pitch, cos_pitch)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is related to the pitch
    theta2 = pitch
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 2
    R2 = rot_y(theta2)
    
    # Transform the target orientation to the frame after joint 1 and joint 2 rotations
    R_after_j2 = R2.T @ R_after_j1
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, so we extract the rotation around Z
    theta3 = math.atan2(R_after_j2[1, 0], R_after_j2[0, 0])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis of the failed examples and the correct joint values, I'm going to provide a final solution:
