Thank you for the additional feedback. I can see that my solution is still not correctly handling the inverse kinematics for this robot. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully and develop a more accurate solution.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that:
1. Joint 1 values are correctly calculated in my solution
2. Joint 2 values can be significantly different from what I'm calculating
3. Joint 3 values are also often incorrect

Let me try a different approach based on a more careful analysis of the robot's kinematics:
