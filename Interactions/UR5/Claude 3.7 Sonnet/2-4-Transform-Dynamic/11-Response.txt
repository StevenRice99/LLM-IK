Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the failed cases, I notice that my approach had several fundamental problems:
1. I incorrectly assumed that joint 3 (Z-axis rotation) directly maps to the Z-rotation of the end effector
2. I didn't properly account for the coupling between the joints
3. My approach to calculating joint 2 was flawed

Let me develop a more accurate solution based on the robot's structure and the correct joint values provided:

    R3_needed = R12.T @ R
    
    # Extract the rotation angle around Z from R3_needed
    # For a rotation around Z, we can use the atan2 of the first row, second column and first row, first column
    theta3 = math.atan2(R3_needed[1, 0], R3_needed[0, 0])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me reconsider the problem more carefully.

The robot has 3 revolute joints:
1. Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis at a height of 0.39225
3. Joint 3: Rotates around Z-axis with a Y-offset of 0.093

Let me simplify and correct my approach:

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me simplify further and focus on the core problem:
