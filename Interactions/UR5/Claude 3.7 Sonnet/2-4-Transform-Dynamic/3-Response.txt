Thank you for providing the forward kinematics results. This helps me understand how the robot's joints affect its end-effector position and orientation. Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator.

Let me analyze the robot structure based on the details provided:
- Joint 1: Revolute joint rotating around Y-axis
- Joint 2: Revolute joint rotating around Y-axis, positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]
- Joint 3: Revolute joint rotating around Z-axis, positioned at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to joint 2
- TCP: End-effector positioned at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 3

I'll now develop the complete inverse kinematics solution by combining insights from the existing code snippets and the forward kinematics results.

                         [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)],

    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle), 0], 
                         [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle), 0],

    # Target rotation matrix
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Joint 1 calculation (around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 1
    R1 = rot_y(joint1)

    # Calculate the remaining rotation needed after joint 1
    R_remaining = R1.T @ R_target
    
    # Extract the angle for joint 2
    # We need to consider the offset of joint 2 (0.39225 in z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in y
    l3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP in z
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2
    j2_pos = np.array([0, 0, 0.39225])
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to the target in joint 1 frame
    vec_to_target = p1 - j2_pos

    # Calculate the remaining rotation needed after joint 2
    R_remaining_after_2 = R2.T @ R_remaining
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
    # Extract the angle for joint 3 from the remaining rotation
    joint3 = math.atan2(R_remaining_after_2[1, 0], R_remaining_after_2[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me think more carefully about the kinematics chain.

The robot has:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at origin
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at [0, 0, 0.39225] from joint 1
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis at [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2
4. TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3

Let me revise the solution:

    # Create rotation matrix for joint 3

    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

I need to refine this solution further. Let me simplify and approach this more systematically:

```python

    # Target rotation matrix
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Joint 1 calculation (around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 1
    R1 = rot_y(joint1)
    
    # Transform target position and orientation to joint 1 frame
    p1 = R1.T @ np.array([x, y, z])

    R2 = rot_y(joint2)

    joint3 = math.atan2(R2_to_target[1, 0], R2_to_target[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This solution is getting closer, but I need to ensure it correctly accounts for all the offsets in the kinematic chain. Let me finalize the solution:
