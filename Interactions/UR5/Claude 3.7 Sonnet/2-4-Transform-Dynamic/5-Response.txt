Thank you for the feedback. I can see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the failures and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values compared to my solution, I notice several patterns:
1. Joint 1 is sometimes close but often off
2. Joint 2 is frequently completely wrong (often 0 or π)
3. Joint 3 is sometimes close but needs improvement

Let me develop a more accurate solution by carefully analyzing the robot's kinematics:
