I apologize for the error in my solution. The error occurs because I'm trying to calculate the square root of a negative number in the line `expected_xz_length = math.sqrt(j3_from_j2_length ** 2 - l2_y ** 2)`. This happens when `j3_from_j2_length` is smaller than `l2_y`, which means the target is unreachable.

Let me provide a corrected solution that properly handles the inverse kinematics for this 3-DOF robot:

```python

Wait, I need to reconsider the problem. Looking at the feedback and the correct joint values, I see that my approach is still not correctly handling the kinematics of this robot. Let me revise my solution:

    joint1 = math.atan2(j3_pos_world[0], j3_pos_world[2])
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 1
    R1 = rot_y(joint1)
    
    # Transform joint 3 position to joint 1 frame
    j3_pos_j1 = R1.T @ j3_pos_world

    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
    # Extract the rotation around Z from R2_to_target
    joint3 = math.atan2(R2_to_target[1, 0], R2_to_target[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at [0, 0, 0.39225] from joint 1
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis at [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2
4. TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3

The key insight I'm missing is how to properly account for the offset of joint 3 in the y-direction. Let me revise my solution:
