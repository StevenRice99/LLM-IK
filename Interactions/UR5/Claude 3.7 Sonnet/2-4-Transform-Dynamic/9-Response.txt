Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints with the following configuration:
   - Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis at origin [0,0,0]
   - Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0.39225]
   - Joint 3: Rotates around Z-axis at position [0,0.093,0.39225]
   - TCP: Located at [0,0.093,0.4869] relative to joint 3

2. From the forward kinematics tests:
   - When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0,0.093,0.4869]
   - When joint 1 is at 1.57 (90°), the TCP moves to approximately [0.487,0.093,0.0004]
   - When joint 2 is at 1.57 (90°), the TCP moves to approximately [0.095,0.093,0.392]
   - When joint 3 is at 1.57 (90°), the TCP position doesn't change, only its orientation

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 1 rotates, it changes the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (joint 3) by removing the effect of l3
    # We need to account for the orientation (rz) when calculating the wrist position
    wrist_x = x - l3 * math.sin(ry) * math.cos(rz)
    wrist_y = y - l2 - l3 * math.sin(rz)
    wrist_z = z - l3 * math.cos(ry) * math.cos(rz)
    
    # Joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The projection of the wrist in the XZ plane
    proj_xz = math.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(proj_xz, l1 - wrist_z / math.cos(theta1) if theta1 != math.pi/2 else l1 - wrist_x)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # Joint 3 directly controls the orientation around Z-axis
    theta3 = rz
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me think more carefully about the robot's kinematics:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Rotate the target point back by -theta1 around Y to simplify the problem
    # This puts the target in the YZ plane of joint 1
    c1, s1 = math.cos(theta1), math.sin(theta1)
    x_rot = c1*x - s1*z
    z_rot = s1*x + c1*z
    
    # Joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the angle that places joint 3 such that the TCP can reach the target
    # First, find the position of joint 3 in the YZ plane
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target in the YZ plane
    d = math.sqrt((z_rot - l1)**2 + (y - l2)**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find the angle
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint directly controls the orientation around Z
    theta3 = rz
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it one more time with a clearer understanding of the robot's structure:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This rotates the arm in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This directly controls the orientation around Z
    theta3 = rz
    
    # For Joint 2, we need to find the angle that positions the end effector at the right height
    # First, project the target onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The height of the target relative to joint 2
    h = y - 0.093  # 0.093 is the Y-offset of joint 3
    
    # The length from joint 2 to TCP
    l_tcp = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate theta2 using inverse trigonometry
    theta2 = math.atan2(r_xz, 0.39225 - h)  # 0.39225 is the Z-offset of joint 2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me take a step back and approach this more systematically:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This directly controls the orientation around Z
    theta3 = rz
    
    # For Joint 2, we need to solve for the angle that positions the TCP at the target
    # First, calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the required angle for joint 2
    # This is the angle needed to position the arm such that the TCP reaches the target
    theta2 = math.atan2(r_xz - l3*math.sin(ry), l1 + l3*math.cos(ry) - y)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful consideration of the robot's structure and the forward kinematics tests, here's my final solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This directly maps to the Z-rotation of the end effector
    theta3 = rz
    
    # Joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the angle that positions the TCP at the target point
    # First, calculate the position in the plane of rotation after joint 1
    dist_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The effective height difference we need to achieve
    height_diff = y - 0.093  # 0.093 is the Y-offset of joint 3
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the arctangent of the ratio
    # We need to account for the TCP length (0.09465) in the XZ plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(dist_xz - 0.09465*math.cos(ry), 0.39225 - height_diff - 0.09465*math.sin(ry))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
