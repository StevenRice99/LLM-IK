Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values compared to my solution and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solver.

Looking at the feedback, I notice that my approach has fundamental flaws in how I'm handling the orientation calculations and the relationship between the joints. Let me develop a new solution based on a more careful analysis of the robot's kinematics.

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully and the provided examples.

After analyzing the failed cases and the correct joint values, I see that my understanding of the robot's kinematics was incorrect. Let me revise the solution:
