Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints:
   - Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0]
   - Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0.39225]
   - Joint 3: Rotates around Z-axis at position [0,0.093,0]
   - TCP: At position [0,0,0.09465] relative to joint 3

2. From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how each joint affects the final position and orientation.

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    # but targeting joint 3's position instead of the TCP
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_pos[0], j3_pos[2])

    if abs(rx - math.pi) < 1e-10 and abs(rz - math.pi) < 1e-10:

                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-np.sin(theta1), 0, np.cos(theta1)]])
    
    R2 = np.array([[np.cos(theta2), 0, np.sin(theta2)],

    R12 = R2 @ R1
    
    # The remaining rotation needed is R3 = R12^-1 @ R
    R3 = np.transpose(R12) @ R
    
    # Extract theta3 from R3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta3 = math.atan2(R3[1, 0], R3[0, 0])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider the approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis

Let me revise the solution:

    theta3 = math.atan2(R3_needed[1, 0], R3_needed[0, 0])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After further analysis, I need to revise the solution again to correctly handle the robot's kinematics:
