I see that my previous solution still has issues. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully and develop a correct solution.

The key insight from the feedback is that the relationship between joint angles and the end effector position is more complex than I initially thought. Let me try a different approach by examining the robot's kinematics more systematically.

    # Calculate the expected orientation after joint 1 and joint 2 rotations
