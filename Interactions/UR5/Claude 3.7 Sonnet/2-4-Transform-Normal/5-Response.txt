I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics results.

Let me analyze the robot structure and kinematics:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints
2. Joint 1 and 2 rotate around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
4. The link dimensions are:
   - Link 1: [0, 0, 0.39225] (vertical offset)
   - Link 2: [0, 0.093, 0] (horizontal offset in y-direction)
   - TCP: [0, 0, 0.09465] (vertical offset from joint 3)

Let me solve the inverse kinematics step by step:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of TCP (z-direction)
    
    # First, we need to determine joint 3 (wrist) angle from the orientation
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, it directly affects the roll (z) component of orientation
    joint3 = r[2]  # The z-component of orientation directly maps to joint 3
    
    # Now we need to account for the effect of joint 3 rotation on the end effector position
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position to find joint 1 and 2
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 by subtracting the effect of the TCP offset
    # We need to consider the orientation of the TCP
    cos_j3 = np.cos(joint3)
    sin_j3 = np.sin(joint3)
    
    # The TCP offset is [0, 0, l3] in the local frame of joint 3
    # We need to transform this to the global frame
    # For a rotation around Z by joint3, the transformation of [0, 0, l3] is:
    # [0, 0, l3] in global frame (ignoring previous joint rotations)
    
    # Position of joint 3 in global frame
    j3_x = x
    j3_y = y
    j3_z = z - l3  # Subtract the z-component of TCP length
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 position
    # Joint 2 is offset from joint 3 by [0, l2, 0] in local frame
    # With joint 3 rotation around Z, this becomes [l2*sin(j3), l2*cos(j3), 0] in global frame
    
    # Position of joint 2 in global frame
    j2_x = j3_x - l2 * sin_j3
    j2_y = j3_y - l2 * cos_j3
    j2_z = j3_z
    
    # Now we can solve for joint 1 and 2
    # Joint 1 is at [0, 0, 0]
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0, l1] when joint 1 = 0
    
    # The distance from origin to joint 2 in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(j2_x**2 + j2_z**2)
    
    # Joint 1 angle is the angle in the XZ plane
    joint1 = np.arctan2(j2_x, j2_z)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is the angle to rotate from vertical to reach joint 2
    # When joint 1 = 0, joint 2 is at [0, 0, l1]
    # We need to rotate to reach [j2_x, j2_y, j2_z]
    
    # Calculate the angle between the vertical and the line to joint 2
    # This is in the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    joint2 = np.arctan2(r_xz - l1 * np.cos(joint1), l1 * np.sin(joint1))
    
    # Adjust joint 2 to account for the fact that at rest position it's pointing up
    joint2 = np.pi/2 - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me revise the solution:

    j2_x = j3_x - l2 * np.sin(joint3)
    j2_y = j3_y - l2 * np.cos(joint3)
    j2_z = j3_z
    
    # Now we need to find joint 1 and 2 angles

```

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

I need to revise this solution once more. Let me carefully analyze the robot structure and the forward kinematics results:
