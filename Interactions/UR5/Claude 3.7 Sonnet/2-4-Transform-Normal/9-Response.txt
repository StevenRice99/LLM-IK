I see the issue with my previous solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics result to understand how the robot's joints work together.

From the forward kinematics result for the first failed case, I can see:
1. Joint 1 (1.5097) rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 (0.8548) also rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 (0.6917) rotates around Z-axis

The key insight is that joint 2's rotation is relative to joint 1's rotation, not absolute. This means I need to account for the combined effect of both rotations.

Let me develop a correct inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (z-direction)
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (y-direction)
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of TCP (z-direction)
    
    # First, determine joint 3 from the orientation
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, which corresponds to the z-component of orientation
    joint3 = r[2]
    
    # The TCP is offset from joint 3 by [0, 0, l3] in joint 3's local frame
    # When rotated by joint 3 around Z, this offset remains [0, 0, l3] in joint 3's frame
    # So we can directly subtract this offset from the target position to get joint 3 position
    j3_x = x
    j3_y = y
    j3_z = z - l3
    
    # Joint 2 is offset from joint 3 by [0, l2, 0] in joint 2's local frame
    # When joint 3 rotates around Z, this offset becomes [l2*sin(j3), l2*cos(j3), 0]
    # in joint 2's frame
    j2_x = j3_x - l2 * np.sin(joint3)
    j2_y = j3_y - l2 * np.cos(joint3)
    j2_z = j3_z
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 1 and joint 2
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y, which affects the position in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to joint 2 in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(j2_x**2 + j2_z**2)
    
    # Joint 1 is the angle in the XZ plane
    joint1 = np.arctan2(j2_x, j2_z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to use the law of cosines to find the angle
    # We have a triangle with sides:
    # - l1 (from origin to where joint 2 would be at rest)
    # - l2 (from joint 2 to joint 3)
    # - r_xz (from origin to joint 2's actual position)
    
    # Using the law of cosines: r_xz^2 = l1^2 + l2^2 - 2*l1*l2*cos(Ï€-joint2)
    # Solving for joint2:
    cos_angle = (l1**2 + l2**2 - r_xz**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_angle = max(min(cos_angle, 1.0), -1.0)
    joint2 = np.pi - np.arccos(cos_angle)
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The forward kinematics shows that joint 2's rotation is more complex than I initially thought. Let me revise:

```python

    import numpy as np

    j2_y = j3_y - l2 * np.cos(joint3)
    j2_z = j3_z
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 1 and joint 2
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y, which affects the position in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to joint 2 in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(j2_x**2 + j2_z**2)
    
    # Joint 1 is the angle in the XZ plane
    joint1 = np.arctan2(j2_x, j2_z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to find the angle between the vertical (z-axis) and the line to joint 2
    # in the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    
    # First, calculate the height of joint 2 relative to the origin
    # This is the projection of joint 2 position onto the rotated z-axis after joint 1 rotation
    height = j2_x * np.sin(joint1) + j2_z * np.cos(joint1)
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance of joint 2 from the rotated z-axis
    # This is the projection of joint 2 position onto the rotated x-axis after joint 1 rotation
    horizontal = j2_x * np.cos(joint1) - j2_z * np.sin(joint1)
    
    # Joint 2 is the angle between the vertical and the line to joint 2
    joint2 = np.arctan2(horizontal, height - l1)
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Let me revise this solution once more based on the forward kinematics:
