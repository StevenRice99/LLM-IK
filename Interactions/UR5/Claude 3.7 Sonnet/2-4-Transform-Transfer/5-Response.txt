I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator that accounts for both position and orientation. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

Based on the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see that:
- Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
- Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
- The link lengths are: l1 = 0.39225, l2 = 0.093 (offset in y), l3 = 0.09465

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.093    # y-offset of link 2
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3
    
    # First, we need to account for the orientation
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, it directly affects the rz orientation
    theta3 = rz
    
    # For joints 1 and 2 (both rotating around Y-axis), we need to solve for position
    # We need to account for the effect of theta3 on the end effector position
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (before the last joint)
    # This requires transforming back from the end effector position using the orientation
    
    # Create rotation matrix from roll, pitch, yaw (rx, ry, rz)
    # For our robot, the main orientation components are from ry (joint 1 and 2) and rz (joint 3)
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, we can compute its effect on the end effector
    c3 = np.cos(theta3)
    s3 = np.sin(theta3)
    
    # The end effector is offset by l3 in the local z direction after joint 3
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 by removing this offset
    
    # Transform back from end effector to joint 3 position
    # The rotation around Z (theta3) affects how the l3 offset projects onto global coordinates
    x_j3 = x - l3 * np.sin(ry) * c3
    y_j3 = y - l3 * s3
    z_j3 = z - l3 * np.cos(ry) * c3
    
    # Now we can solve for theta1 and theta2 using the position of joint 3
    # We need to account for the y-offset (l2) of joint 3
    
    # The y-coordinate is determined by l2
    # For a valid solution, y_j3 should be equal to l2
    # If there's a discrepancy, we adjust our approach
    
    # Calculate the projection of joint 3 position onto the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x_j3**2 + (z_j3 - l1)**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    # We're solving for the angle between link 1 and the line to joint 3
    theta2 = np.arctan2(x_j3, z_j3 - l1)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the orientation
    # Joint 1 and 2 together determine the ry orientation
    theta1 = ry - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me think more carefully about how the joints affect the orientation.

Looking at the robot structure again:
- Joint 1 (theta1) rotates around Y-axis
- Joint 2 (theta2) rotates around Y-axis
- Joint 3 (theta3) rotates around Z-axis

The orientation parameter r = [rx, ry, rz] represents the roll-pitch-yaw angles.

Let me complete the solution correctly:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, it directly contributes to rz
    theta3 = rz
    
    # The y-coordinate is determined by the offset of link 3 and is not affected by joint angles
    # For our robot, y should be equal to the y-offset of link 3 (0.093)
    # If y differs from 0.093, it means we need to adjust our approach
    
    # Calculate the position that joints 1 and 2 need to reach
    # We need to account for the effect of theta3 on the end effector position
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.093    # y-offset of link 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3
    
    # For the position, we can use the existing solution as a starting point
    # But we need to account for the orientation as well
    
    # The rotation around Z (theta3) affects the x and z coordinates
    c3 = np.cos(theta3)
    s3 = np.sin(theta3)
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the orientation
    # This is the position that joints 1 and 2 need to reach
    x_adjusted = x - l3 * s3
    z_adjusted = z - l3 * c3
    
    # Now solve for theta1 and theta2 using the adjusted position
    r = np.sqrt(x_adjusted**2 + z_adjusted**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Find theta1 using the adjusted position
    phi = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l3 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x_adjusted, z_adjusted) - phi
    
    # The orientation ry is determined by theta1 and theta2
    # We need to ensure that theta1 and theta2 give us the desired ry
    # For our robot, ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to refine this solution further. Let me reconsider how the orientation parameters relate to the joint angles.

Here's the corrected solution:

```python

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p

    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of TCP from joint 3
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis and directly determines rz
    theta3 = rz
    
    # For a robot with this configuration, ry is determined by the sum of theta1 and theta2
    # Both joints 1 and 2 rotate around the Y-axis
    # So ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    # First, solve for position to get initial values for theta1 and theta2
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    phi = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta2), l1 + l3 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z) - phi
    
    # Now adjust theta1 and theta2 to achieve the desired orientation ry
    # Since ry = theta1 + theta2, we need to ensure this constraint is met
    
    # Calculate the current ry from our initial theta1 and theta2
    current_ry = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Adjust theta1 to achieve the desired ry while maintaining the position
    theta1 = theta1 + (ry - current_ry)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to be more careful about how the orientation is determined. Let me revise my solution:

    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z) - phi
    
    # For this robot configuration, ry is determined by theta1 and theta2
    # Since both rotate around Y-axis, their combined effect gives ry
    # We need to adjust our solution to achieve the desired ry
    
    # The orientation ry should be equal to theta1 + theta2
    # We'll adjust theta1 to achieve this while maintaining the position
    
    # Calculate the current orientation
    current_ry = theta1 + theta2

    # This adjustment maintains the position while changing the orientation

I need to be more precise about how the orientation is determined. Let me finalize the solution:
