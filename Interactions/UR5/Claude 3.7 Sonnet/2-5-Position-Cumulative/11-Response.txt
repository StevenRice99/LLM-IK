Based on the feedback, my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct solutions, I notice:
1. Joint 1 and joint 2 values vary significantly from my solution
2. Joint 3 values are often in the opposite direction
3. Joint 4 is consistently set to 0 in the correct solutions

Let me revise my approach completely:

```python
import math

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (y-direction)
    L3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to joint 4 (z-direction)
    L4 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 4 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # First, we need to find the wrist position (joint 4)
    # We need to account for the TCP offset and joint 3 rotation
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 3 to TCP in the XY plane
    r_tcp = math.sqrt(x**2 + (y - L2)**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the TCP in the XY plane
    phi_tcp = math.atan2(x, y - L2)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle
    theta3 = phi_tcp
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4
    # Joint 4 is at a distance L4 from the TCP in the direction opposite to theta3
    x_j4 = x - L4 * math.sin(theta3)
    y_j4 = y - L4 * math.cos(theta3)
    z_j4 = z
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 1 and 2
    # These joints control the position of joint 4 in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to joint 4 in the XZ plane
    r_j4 = math.sqrt(x_j4**2 + (z_j4 - L1)**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 4 in the XZ plane
    phi_j4 = math.atan2(x_j4, z_j4 - L1)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + L3**2 - r_j4**2) / (2 * L1 * L3)
    
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Joint 2 angle
    theta2 = -math.acos(cos_theta2)  # Negative to match the correct solutions
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find an angle for joint 1
    cos_alpha = (L1**2 + r_j4**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L1 * r_j4)
    
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    theta1 = phi_j4 - alpha
    
    # Joint 4 is consistently 0 in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Looking at the correct joint values more carefully, I see that joint 2 can be both positive and negative, and joint 3 values don't directly correspond to the atan2 of x and y-L2.

Let me try a different approach:
