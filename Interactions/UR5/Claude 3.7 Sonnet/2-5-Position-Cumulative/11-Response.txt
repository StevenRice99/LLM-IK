Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback and develop a better solution.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that joint 4 is consistently set to 0 in all the examples. This suggests that joint 4 might have a specific role in the robot's kinematics that I didn't properly account for.

Let me revise my approach completely:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # From the feedback, it appears that joint 4 is consistently set to 0
    # This suggests that joint 4 is used for orientation control rather than position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint 4
    # Since joint 4 is at 0, this offset is fixed in the robot's frame
    
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position to find the position of joint 3
    # First, account for the TCP offset to find joint 4 position
    x_j4 = x
    y_j4 = y - 0.0823
    z_j4 = z
    
    # Joint 4 is at [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3
    x_j3 = x_j4
    y_j3 = y_j4
    z_j3 = z_j4 - 0.09465
    
    # Joint 3 angle (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    theta3 = math.atan2(x_j3, y_j3)
    
    # Joint 3 is at [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, we need to account for this rotation
    # when calculating joint 2's position
    x_j2 = x_j3
    y_j2 = y_j3 - 0.093 * math.cos(theta3)
    z_j2 = z_j3 + 0.093 * math.sin(theta3)
    
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0, 0.39225] from joint 1
    # Joint 1 and 2 both rotate around Y-axis, creating a 2D problem in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to joint 2 in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_j2**2 + z_j2**2)
    
    # If r < 0.39225, the target is too close to the base
    if r < 0.39225:
        # Handle this case - perhaps set joint 2 to a default value
        theta1 = math.atan2(x_j2, z_j2)
        theta2 = 0  # Default value
    else:
        # Calculate joint 1 angle
        theta1 = math.atan2(x_j2, z_j2)
        
        # Calculate joint 2 angle
        # We need to find the angle that places joint 2 at the right position
        # after joint 1's rotation
        
        # Position of joint 2 after joint 1 rotation
        x_j2_from_j1 = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
        z_j2_from_j1 = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
        
        # Vector from joint 2's position after joint 1 rotation to the target joint 2 position
        dx = x_j2 - x_j2_from_j1
        dz = z_j2 - z_j2_from_j1
        
        # Calculate joint 2 angle
        theta2 = math.atan2(dx, dz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not accounting for the joint rotations correctly. Let me revise again:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # From the feedback, joint 4 is consistently set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint 4 with orientation [0, 0, 1.57...]
    # Since joint 4 is at 0, this offset is fixed
    x_j4 = x
    y_j4 = y - 0.0823
    z_j4 = z
    
    # Joint 4 is at [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 3
    x_j3 = x_j4
    y_j3 = y_j4
    z_j3 = z_j4 - 0.09465
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
    # Calculate the angle of joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(x_j3, y_j3)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2
    # Joint 3 is at [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 2 in joint 2's local frame
    # After rotation of joint 3, this offset becomes:
    # [0.093 * sin(theta3), 0.093 * cos(theta3), 0]
    x_j2 = x_j3 - 0.093 * math.sin(theta3)
    y_j2 = y_j3 - 0.093 * math.cos(theta3)
    z_j2 = z_j3
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 1 and 2, which both rotate around Y-axis
    # This creates a 2D problem in the XZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to joint 2 in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_j2**2 + z_j2**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle from the origin to joint 2 in the XZ plane
    phi = math.atan2(x_j2, z_j2)
    
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0, 0.39225] from joint 1
    # We need to find theta1 and theta2 such that after rotations,
    # joint 2 is at the calculated position
    
    # If r < 0.39225, the target is unreachable
    if r < 0.39225:
        # Handle this case - set to a reasonable default
        theta1 = phi
        theta2 = 0
    else:
        # Calculate theta1 (joint 1 angle)
        theta1 = phi
        
        # Calculate theta2 (joint 2 angle)
        # After joint 1 rotation, joint 2 is at [0.39225 * sin(theta1), 0, 0.39225 * cos(theta1)]
        # We need to find the angle that rotates joint 2 to place joint 3 at the right position
        
        # Position of joint 2 after joint 1 rotation
        x_j2_after_j1 = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
        z_j2_after_j1 = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
        
        # Vector from joint 2 to joint 3
        dx = x_j3 - x_j2_after_j1
        dz = z_j3 - z_j2_after_j1
        
        # Calculate theta2
        theta2 = math.atan2(dx, dz) - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully:

Looking at the feedback examples, I notice that joint 4 is always 0, which suggests it's not being used for position control in these examples. Let me try a different approach:

    if cross_product < 0:
        angle = -angle
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = angle
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a more direct approach based on the examples:

```python

```

After analyzing the examples more carefully, I believe this solution is closer to correct. Let me finalize it:

```python
import math

    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset and joint offsets
    # The TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint 4 in joint 4's local frame
    # After rotation by theta3, this offset becomes:
    # [0.0823 * sin(theta3), 0.0823 * cos(theta3), 0]

    y_adjusted = y_adjusted - 0.093 * math.cos(theta3)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_adjusted, z_adjusted)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Y-axis)

    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(dx, dz) - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This solution should be much closer to correct. It:
1. Sets joint 4 to 0 as observed in the examples
2. Calculates joint 3 angle based on the XY orientation
3. Adjusts the target position to account for all offsets
4. Calculates joint 1 angle based on the adjusted target position
5. Calculates joint 2 angle to reach the adjusted target position
