Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better solution.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice:
1. Joint 2 is not always 0 as I incorrectly assumed
2. Joint 4 is consistently 0 in all the correct solutions
3. The relationship between the target position and joint angles is more complex than I initially thought

Let me revise my approach completely:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Joint 4 is always 0 based on the provided correct solutions
    joint4 = 0.0
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 (which is the same as TCP position since joint4 = 0)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position
    # Since the TCP has an offset in Y direction, we need to adjust
    y_target = y - l4
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XZ plane
    joint3 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 1 and joint 2, we need to solve a 2-link planar manipulator problem
    # in the plane defined by the Y axis and the radial distance r
    
    # The end effector position in this plane is (r, y_target)
    # We need to find joint1 and joint2 to reach this position
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from the base to the target
    d_squared = r**2 + (y_target - l2)**2
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint2
    cos_joint2 = (d_squared - l1**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    cos_joint2 = np.clip(cos_joint2, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    # There are two possible solutions for joint2 (elbow up or elbow down)
    # Based on the examples, we need to choose the correct one
    joint2 = -np.arccos(cos_joint2)  # Negative value seems to match the examples
    
    # Now calculate joint1
    # First, find the angle to the target from the base
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_target - l2, r)
    
    # Then find the angle from the first link to the line to the target
    beta = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(joint2), l1 + l3 * np.cos(joint2))
    
    # Joint1 is the difference between these angles
    joint1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Normalize joint3 to be in the same range as the examples
    if joint3 > np.pi:
        joint3 -= 2 * np.pi
    elif joint3 < -np.pi:
        joint3 += 2 * np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the examples more carefully:

1. The TCP has a Y offset and a rotation around Z (1.57 radians or 90 degrees)
2. Joint 4 is consistently 0 in all examples
3. The relationship between joints 1, 2, and 3 is complex

Let me revise my solution:

```python

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Joint 4 is always 0 based on the provided correct solutions
    joint4 = 0.0
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    # Since the TCP has a Y offset and is rotated 90 degrees around Z,
    # we need to adjust the target position
    y_target = y - l4
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z axis)
    joint3 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The position we need to reach with joints 1 and 2 is (r, y_target)
    # We need to solve the inverse kinematics for a 2-link planar manipulator
    
    # The effective length of the second link includes the Y offset of joint 3
    l2_effective = np.sqrt(l2**2 + l3**2)
    
    # The angle of the second link relative to the horizontal
    phi = np.arctan2(l2, l3)
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from the base to the target
    d_squared = r**2 + y_target**2
    d = np.sqrt(d_squared)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between the links
    cos_alpha = (d_squared - l1**2 - l2_effective**2) / (2 * l1 * l2_effective)
    cos_alpha = np.clip(cos_alpha, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate the angle to the target from the base
    beta = np.arctan2(y_target, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle of the first link
    gamma = np.arctan2(l2_effective * np.sin(alpha), l1 + l2_effective * np.cos(alpha))
    
    # Joint 1 is the angle of the first link
    joint1 = beta - gamma
    
    # Joint 2 is the angle between the links, adjusted by phi
    joint2 = np.pi - alpha - phi
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a different approach based on the examples:

    # Rotate the point (x, z) by -joint3 to align with the robot's plane

    z_rot = -x * np.sin(-joint3) + z * np.cos(-joint3)
