Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure:

1. The robot has 4 revolute joints
2. Joints 1, 2, and 4 rotate around the Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Z-axis
4. The TCP has an offset in the Y direction and a rotation around the Z-axis

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (z-direction)
    L2 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (y-direction)
    L3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to joint 4 (z-direction)
    L4 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 4 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # First, solve for joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint affects the x-position of the end effector
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z - L1)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the end effector in the YZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + (z - L1)**2)
    
    # Now solve for joint 2 and joint 4 (both rotate around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the position of the wrist (joint 4) first
    # The TCP is offset from the wrist by L4 in the Y direction
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist
    y_wrist = y - L4 * math.cos(theta3)
    
    # Now we have a 2-link planar manipulator in the YZ plane (formed by joints 2 and 4)
    # with link lengths L2 and L3
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist
    d = math.sqrt((y_wrist - L2)**2 + r**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 4
    cos_theta4 = (L2**2 + L3**2 - d**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta4 = max(min(cos_theta4, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta4 = math.acos(cos_theta4)
    
    # Use the law of cosines again to find the angle at joint 2
    cos_alpha = (L2**2 + d**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * d)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_alpha = max(min(cos_alpha, 1.0), -1.0)
    alpha = math.acos(cos_alpha)
    
    # Calculate the angle between the vertical and the line from joint 2 to the wrist
    beta = math.atan2(r, y_wrist - L2)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = alpha + beta
    
    # Joint 1 is at the base and doesn't affect the position
    theta1 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Looking at the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. Joint 1 (revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis and affects the position in the XZ plane
2. Joint 2 (revolute 2) also rotates around the Y-axis and affects the position in the XZ plane
3. Joint 3 (revolute 3) rotates around the Z-axis and affects the position in the XY plane
4. Joint 4 (revolute 4) rotates around the Y-axis and affects the orientation of the TCP

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    # First, we need to find the position of joint 4 (the wrist)
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by L4 in the y-direction when joint 3 is at 0
    # When joint 3 is not 0, the offset is rotated in the XY plane
    
    # We need to determine joint 3 angle first
    # Joint 3 rotates in the XY plane

    # Now we need to solve for joints 1 and 2 to position joint 4 correctly
    # This is a 2-link planar manipulator in the YZ plane
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane from the origin to joint 4
    r = math.sqrt(x_j4**2 + (z - L1 - L3)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find joint 2 angle
    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + L3**2 - r**2) / (2 * L1 * L3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Joint 4 is used for orientation and doesn't affect position
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it once more based on the forward kinematics tests:
