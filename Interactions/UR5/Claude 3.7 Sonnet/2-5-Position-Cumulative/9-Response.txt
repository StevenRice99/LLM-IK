Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS section and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
4. Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis
5. The TCP has an offset and orientation relative to joint 4

Here's my solution for the inverse kinematics:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Account for the TCP offset from joint 4
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint 4
    y_target = y - 0.0823
    
    # Solve for joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint affects the x-y plane orientation
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, y_target)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-z plane
    # after accounting for joint 3 rotation
    xy_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + y_target**2)
    
    # The effective distance in the direction after joint 3 rotation
    effective_y = xy_dist
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the effective y-z plane
    # with joints 1, 2, and 4 (all rotating around Y-axis)
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 in y direction
    l3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    
    # For the Y-axis rotations, we need to solve in the effective y-z plane
    # The target position in this plane is (effective_y, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 relative to the target
    # This helps us determine joint 4 angle
    joint3_to_target_z = 0
    joint3_to_target_y = l3
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 in the effective y-z plane
    joint3_y = effective_y - joint3_to_target_y * math.cos(0)  # Assuming joint 4 is at 0 initially
    joint3_z = z - joint3_to_target_z
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in the effective y-z plane
    # Joint 2 to joint 3 has an offset in the y direction
    joint2_y = joint3_y - l2
    joint2_z = joint3_z
    
    # Now solve for joint 1 and joint 2 angles
    # Joint 1 angle is determined by the direction from origin to joint 2
    theta1 = math.atan2(joint2_y, joint2_z - l1)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is determined by the direction from joint 2 to joint 3
    # relative to the direction from joint 1 to joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(joint3_y - joint2_y, joint3_z - joint2_z) - theta1
    
    # Joint 4 angle is determined to keep the end effector orientation
    # Since we want the TCP to reach the target position, and it has a fixed orientation
    # relative to joint 4, we can calculate joint 4 angle
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 (revolute) rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0]
2. Joint 2 (revolute) rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0.39225] relative to joint 1
3. Joint 3 (revolute) rotates around Z-axis at position [0,0.093,0] relative to joint 2
4. Joint 4 (revolute) rotates around Y-axis at position [0,0,0.09465] relative to joint 3
5. TCP is at position [0,0.0823,0] relative to joint 4 with orientation [0,0,1.57...]

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 4 given the TCP position
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint 4 with a rotation around Z
    # Since joint 4 rotates around Y, the TCP offset is always in the y direction
    y_j4 = y - 0.0823
    x_j4 = x
    z_j4 = z
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, which affects the x-y plane
    # Calculate the distance from joint 3 to joint 4 in the x-y plane
    theta3 = math.atan2(x_j4, y_j4)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3
    # Joint 4 is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 3 (in joint 3's local frame)
    # After rotation by theta3, we need to transform this offset
    x_j3 = x_j4 - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta3)
    y_j3 = y_j4 - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta3)
    z_j3 = z_j4

    x_j2 = x_j3
    y_j2 = y_j3 - 0.093
    z_j2 = z_j3
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the x-z plane for joints 1 and 2 (both rotate around Y)
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 1
    
    # Calculate the distance from origin to joint 2 in the x-z plane
    dist_xz = math.sqrt(x_j2**2 + z_j2**2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 (angle of joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_j2, z_j2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (angle of joint 2)
    # We need to find the angle that places joint 2 at the calculated position
    # The position of joint 2 after rotation of joint 1 is:
    # [0.39225 * sin(theta1), 0, 0.39225 * cos(theta1)]
    # We need to find theta2 such that after rotation, joint 3 is at the calculated position
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 after rotation of joint 1
    x_j2_after_j1 = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    z_j2_after_j1 = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to joint 3
    vec_j2_to_j3_x = x_j3 - x_j2_after_j1
    vec_j2_to_j3_z = z_j3 - z_j2_after_j1
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(vec_j2_to_j3_x, vec_j2_to_j3_z) - theta1
    
    # Calculate theta4 (angle of joint 4)
    # Joint 4 needs to be oriented to keep the TCP at the desired position
    # Since the TCP has a fixed orientation relative to joint 4, we can calculate theta4
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Let me simplify and approach this more systematically:

    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, this offset can be in both x and y directions
    
    # We need to solve for joint 3 angle first
    # The projection of the TCP position onto the XY plane gives us the direction

    theta3 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Now we can find the position of joint 4
    # The TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0] relative to joint 4 in joint 4's local frame

    # for the angles of joints 1 and 2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Let me refine this solution one more time to ensure it's correct:
