Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 4-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
- Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at height 0.39225
- Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis with 0.093 offset in Y
- Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis at height 0.09465 from joint 3
- TCP has an offset of 0.0823 in Y from joint 4

Here's my solution for the inverse kinematics:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to joint 4
    y_offset_j3 = 0.093  # Y offset of joint 3
    y_offset_tcp = 0.0823  # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_target = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z)
    # This joint affects the orientation in the XZ plane
    if abs(x) < 1e-10 and abs(z) < 1e-10:
        # Special case: target directly above/below the robot
        joint3 = 0.0
    else:
        joint3 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target onto the XZ plane after joint 3 rotation
    # Rotate the point (x, z) by -joint3 around Y axis
    x_rot = x * np.cos(-joint3) - z * np.sin(-joint3)
    z_rot = x * np.sin(-joint3) + z * np.cos(-joint3)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x_rot**2 + z_rot**2)
    
    # Adjust Y target to account for joint 3 offset
    y_adj = y_target - y_offset_j3
    
    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 2 to target
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find joint 2 and joint 4 angles
    cos_joint4 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_joint4 = np.clip(cos_joint4, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    joint4 = np.arccos(cos_joint4)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 using the angle to the target and the inner angle
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_adj, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint4), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint4))
    
    joint1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (this is actually a fixed value of 0 in this robot)
    joint2 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider the solution based on the robot structure. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to joint 4
    y_offset_j3 = 0.093  # Y offset of joint 3
    y_offset_tcp = 0.0823  # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_target = y - y_offset_tcp
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z)
    joint3 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust Y target to account for joint 3 offset
    y_adj = y_target - y_offset_j3
    
    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 2 to target
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find joint angles
    cos_joint4 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_joint4 = np.clip(cos_joint4, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    joint4 = np.arccos(cos_joint4)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 using the angle to the target and the inner angle
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_adj, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint4), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint4))
    
    joint1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Joint 2 is fixed at 0 based on the robot structure
    joint2 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
```

Actually, I need to carefully reconsider the kinematics based on the robot structure and the forward kinematics tests. Let me provide the final solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to joint 4
    y_offset_j3 = 0.093  # Y offset of joint 3
    y_offset_tcp = 0.0823  # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y - y_offset_tcp - y_offset_j3
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z)
    joint3 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the planar distance from joint 2 to target
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_adjusted**2)
    
    # Use law of cosines to find joint angles
    cos_joint4 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_joint4 = np.clip(cos_joint4, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure value is in valid range
    
    joint4 = np.arccos(cos_joint4)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 using the angle to the target and the inner angle
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_adjusted, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint4), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint4))
    
    joint1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Joint 2 is fixed at 0 based on the robot structure
    joint2 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3, joint4)
