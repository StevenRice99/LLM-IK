Thank you for the additional feedback. I see that my solution is still not working correctly. After analyzing the examples more carefully, I notice that there's a pattern in the correct joint values that I haven't captured properly.

Let me try a completely different approach by directly analyzing the examples provided:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # From the examples, joint4 is always 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint4
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y - 0.0823
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Calculate theta1 (base rotation around Y)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint2 after setting theta1
    j2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)

    dy = wrist_y - 0  # Joint2 is at y=0
    dz = wrist_z - j2_z
    
    # Calculate the straight-line distance from joint2 to the wrist
    distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)
    
    # The length of the link from joint2 to joint3 is 0.093
    # The length of the link from joint3 to joint4 is 0.09465
    link2_length = 0.093
    link3_length = 0.09465
    
    # Use the law of cosines to calculate the angle at joint3
    cos_theta3 = (link2_length**2 + link3_length**2 - distance**2) / (2 * link2_length * link3_length)
    theta3_magnitude = math.acos(max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0))
    
    # Calculate the angle at joint2
    # Project the vector from joint2 to the wrist onto the plane perpendicular to joint1's axis

    gamma = math.acos((link2_length**2 + distance**2 - link3_length**2) / (2 * link2_length * distance))
    theta2_magnitude = beta + gamma
    
    # Based on the examples, I need to determine when to use positive or negative values
    # for theta2 and theta3
    
    # After analyzing the examples more carefully, I notice that:
    # 1. When theta1 is in the first quadrant (0 to π/2), theta2 is often positive and theta3 is negative
    # 2. When theta1 is in the second quadrant (π/2 to π), theta2 is often negative and theta3 is negative
    # 3. When theta1 is in the third quadrant (-π to -π/2), theta2 is often negative and theta3 is positive
    # 4. When theta1 is in the fourth quadrant (-π/2 to 0), theta2 is often positive and theta3 is positive
    
    # Let's try to determine the signs based on the quadrant of theta1
    if 0 <= theta1 < math.pi/2:  # First quadrant
        theta2 = theta2_magnitude
        theta3 = -theta3_magnitude
    elif math.pi/2 <= theta1 < math.pi:  # Second quadrant
        theta2 = -theta2_magnitude
