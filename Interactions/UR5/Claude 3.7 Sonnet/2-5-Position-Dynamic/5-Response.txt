I'll now develop a solution for the inverse kinematics of this 4-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and forward kinematics results to derive the inverse kinematics solution.

Based on the robot description and forward kinematics results:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis after a Z-offset of 0.39225
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis after an Y-offset of 0.093
4. Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis after a Z-offset of 0.09465
5. The TCP has an Y-offset of 0.0823 and a rotation around Z-axis

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 4
    # Since the TCP has a rotation around Z, we need to consider this in our calculations
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 by subtracting the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset in the Y direction in the local frame of joint 4
    # We need to consider the orientation of joint 4 to determine the global offset
    
    # For a general solution, we need to solve for all joint angles
    
    # Joint 1 (base joint) rotates around Y-axis
    # This affects the X and Z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target point
    # We need to account for the height offset of joint 2
    r = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (y - l2 - l4)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 2
    # The triangle is formed by l1, l3, and r
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the height of the target
    if y < l2 + l4:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 3 (rotates around Z-axis)
    # This is the angle in the XZ plane from the projection of the arm
    phi = math.atan2(y - l2 - l4, r_xz)
    theta3 = phi - theta2
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 4 (rotates around Y-axis)
    # This is needed to orient the end effector correctly
    # For a position-only IK, we can set this to compensate for the previous joints
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The robot has a more complex structure than I initially analyzed. Let me revise my approach:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # Since the TCP has a rotation around Z of 1.57 (90 degrees), 
    # the TCP offset is primarily in the Y direction in the local frame
    
    # Joint 1 and 2 rotate around Y-axis, Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis
    
    # For joint 1, we need to determine the angle in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For the remaining joints, we'll work in the plane defined by joint 1
    # Project the target point onto this plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # We need to solve for joints 2, 3, and 4 to reach the target position
    # This is a 3-DOF planar manipulator problem in the new plane
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by l4 in the Y direction in the local frame
    y_adj = y - l4
    
    # Now we have a 2-link planar manipulator problem (joints 2 and 3)
    # with lengths l1 and l3, and target position (r_xz, y_adj)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the adjusted target
    d = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (y_adj - l2)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (l1**2 + l3**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(y_adj - l2, r_xz)
    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l1 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 4 to keep the end effector oriented correctly
    # For a position-only IK, we can set this to compensate for the previous joints
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to refine this solution further. Let me correct my approach:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 by accounting for the TCP offset
    # Since the TCP has a rotation around Z of 1.57 (90 degrees),
    # we need to consider this rotation when calculating the offset
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target point onto the plane defined by joint 1
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joints 2, 3, and 4, we're working in a plane
    # We need to solve for the position of joint 4 first
    # Then use that to solve for joints 2 and 3
    
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by l4 in the Y direction in the local frame
    # Due to the 90-degree rotation around Z, this offset is in a different direction
    # in the global frame, depending on the joint angles
    
    # For simplicity, let's assume the TCP offset is primarily in the Y direction
    y_j4 = y - l4
    
    # Now we have a 2-link planar manipulator problem with joints 2 and 3
    # The first link has length l1 in Z and l2 in Y
    # The second link has length l3 in Z
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to joint 4
    d = math.sqrt(r_xz**2 + (y_j4)**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle for joint 3
    # The triangle is formed by the links with lengths sqrt(l1^2 + l2^2), l3, and d
    link1_length = math.sqrt(l1**2 + l2**2)
    cos_theta3 = (link1_length**2 + l3**2 - d**2) / (2 * link1_length * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2
    beta = math.atan2(y_j4, r_xz)
    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), link1_length + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    # Adjust for the orientation of the first link
    theta2 = theta2 - math.atan2(l2, l1)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 4
    # For a position-only IK, we can set this to maintain the end effector orientation
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After further analysis, I realize I need to be more precise with the geometry. Let me provide the final solution:
