Thank you for providing the forward kinematics results. Now I can analyze the robot's structure and develop the inverse kinematics solution.

Based on the information provided, I'll develop a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of this 4-DOF serial manipulator.

Let me analyze the robot structure:
- Joint 1: Revolute joint rotating around Y-axis at origin
- Joint 2: Revolute joint rotating around Y-axis, positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]
- Joint 3: Revolute joint rotating around Z-axis, positioned at [0, 0.093, 0]
- Joint 4: Revolute joint rotating around Y-axis, positioned at [0, 0, 0.09465]
- TCP: End effector positioned at [0, 0.0823, 0]

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset from the last joint
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint 4
    # We need to find the position of joint 4
    
    # Since the TCP has a rotation around Z of 1.57 radians (90 degrees),
    # we need to consider this when calculating the joint 4 position
    
    # The TCP offset is [0, 0.0823, 0] in the local frame of joint 4
    # When rotated by 90 degrees around Z, this becomes [-0.0823, 0, 0]
    # So we need to subtract this vector from the target position
    
    # Joint 4 position
    j4_x = x + 0.0823  # Accounting for the rotated offset
    j4_y = y
    j4_z = z
    
    # Now we can solve for the first two joints using a similar approach to EXISTING 1
    # Joint 1 controls the rotation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(j4_x, j4_z)
    
    # Distance from origin to the projection of joint 4 in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(j4_x**2 + j4_z**2)
    
    # The height of joint 3 is fixed at 0.093 above joint 2
    # Joint 2 is at height 0.39225 from the base
    # Joint 4 is at height 0.09465 above joint 3
    
    # Total height from joint 2 to joint 4
    height_j2_to_j4 = 0.093 + 0.09465
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 4 in the XZ plane
    # This is the horizontal distance that joint 2 needs to create
    horizontal_dist = r_xz - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Vertical distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    vertical_dist = j4_y - 0
    
    # Angle needed for joint 2 to position joint 4 correctly
    theta2 = math.atan2(vertical_dist, horizontal_dist)
    
    # For joint 3, we need to consider that it rotates around the Z axis
    # This joint controls the orientation in the XY plane
    
    # Calculate the angle needed for joint 3
    # Joint 3 needs to orient the arm so that joint 4 can reach the target
    theta3 = math.atan2(j4_x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1), j4_z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)) - theta1 - theta2
    
    # Joint 4 is the final adjustment to reach the target position
    # It rotates around the Y axis like joints 1 and 2
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y at the origin
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to joint 1
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to joint 2
4. Joint 4 rotates around Y at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 3
5. TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0] relative to joint 4

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

    # Since the TCP has a rotation around Z of 1.57 radians (90 degrees),
    # we need to consider this when calculating the joint 4 position
    
    # Joint 4 position (accounting for the TCP offset)
    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y - 0.0823  # Subtract the TCP offset in y

    # Calculate the position of joint 2 after setting theta1

    # Vertical distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    dy = j4_y - 0
    
    # Calculate the total distance from joint 2 to joint 4
    r_j2_j4 = math.sqrt(r_j2_j4_xz**2 + dy**2)
    
    # Length of the link from joint 2 to joint 3
    l_j2_j3 = 0.093
    
    # Length of the link from joint 3 to joint 4
    l_j3_j4 = 0.09465
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (r_j2_j4**2 - l_j2_j3**2 - l_j3_j4**2) / (2 * l_j2_j3 * l_j3_j4)
    theta2 = math.acos(max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0))
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of sines
    sin_theta3 = (l_j2_j3 * math.sin(theta2)) / r_j2_j4
    theta3 = math.asin(max(min(sin_theta3, 1.0), -1.0))
    
    # Adjust theta3 based on the position of joint 4 relative to joint 2
    if dy < 0:
        theta3 = math.pi - theta3
    
    # Calculate theta4 to orient the end effector correctly
    theta4 = math.atan2(j4_y, r_j2_j4_xz) - theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me simplify and approach this more systematically:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Account for the TCP offset to find joint 4 position
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] in the local frame of joint 4
    # With the 90-degree rotation around Z, we need to adjust accordingly
    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y - 0.0823
    j4_z = z
    
    # Joint 1 (base joint) rotates around Y-axis

    theta1 = math.atan2(j4_x, j4_z)
    
    # Transform the target point to the frame after joint 1 rotation
    # This simplifies the problem to a 2D problem in the YZ' plane
    # where Z' is the new Z axis after rotation of joint 1
    r_xz = math.sqrt(j4_x**2 + j4_z**2)
    
    # Position of joint 2 in the global frame after setting theta1
    j2_x = 0

    dz = j4_z - j2_xz_z
    
    # Distance in the XZ plane from joint 2 to joint 4
    r_j2_j4_xz = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2)
    
    # Total distance from joint 2 to joint 4

    # Calculate theta4 to orient the end effector correctly
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me revise it one more time with a clearer approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] with a rotation of 90 degrees around Z
    # This means the offset is effectively [-0.0823, 0, 0] in the global frame
    j4_x = x + 0.0823
    j4_y = y
    j4_z = z
    
    # Joint 1 determines the orientation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(j4_x, j4_z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 after setting theta1

    r_j2_j4 = math.sqrt(r_proj**2 + dy**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (l_j2_j3**2 + l_j3_j4**2 - r_j2_j4**2) / (2 * l_j2_j3 * l_j3_j4)

After careful consideration, I believe there's still an issue with my understanding of the robot's structure. Let me provide a final, corrected solution:
