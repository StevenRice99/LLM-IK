Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice a pattern: the fourth joint (joint4) is consistently set to 0 in all the successful solutions. This suggests that the robot might be using only 3 of its 4 degrees of freedom to reach the target positions.

Let me revise my approach completely:

```python
import math

    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint4 is consistently set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the X and Z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # With joint1 determined, we can work in the plane defined by this angle
    # Project the target onto this plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 to reach the target
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
    
    # The position of the TCP relative to joint 3 depends on joint 3's angle
    # Since joint 4 is fixed at 0, the TCP is offset from joint 3 by:
    # - l3 in the Z direction
    # - l4 in the Y direction (due to the TCP's orientation)
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # This is an inverse kinematics problem for a 2-link manipulator
    
    # First, calculate the position of joint 3 in the XZ plane
    # Joint 3 is at a height of l2 above joint 2, which is at height 0
    y_j3 = l2
    
    # The TCP is at position (x, y, z)
    # Joint 3 is at position (x_j3, y_j3, z_j3)

    # This is a complex system to solve directly
    # Let's use a different approach based on the observed pattern
    
    # From the feedback, it appears that joint 3 is used to control the height (y)
    # and joint 2 is used to control the distance in the XZ plane
