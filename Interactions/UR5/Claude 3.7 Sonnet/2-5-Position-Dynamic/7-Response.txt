Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better solution.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice that the fourth joint (joint4) is consistently set to 0 in all the successful examples. This suggests that the fourth joint might have a specific role in the kinematics that I didn't properly account for.

Let me revise my approach completely:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # From the examples, we can see that joint4 is consistently set to 0
    # This suggests that the end effector orientation is fixed
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # The robot structure:
    # Joint 1: Revolute around Y at origin
    # Joint 2: Revolute around Y at [0, 0, 0.39225]
    # Joint 3: Revolute around Z at [0, 0.093, 0]
    # Joint 4: Revolute around Y at [0, 0, 0.09465]
    # TCP: End effector at [0, 0.0823, 0]
    
    # Since joint4 is fixed at 0, we need to find the position of joint3
    # The TCP is offset from joint4 by [0, 0.0823, 0]
    # With joint4 at 0, this offset remains [0, 0.0823, 0]
    
    # Calculate the position of joint3
    j3_x = x - 0.0823  # Subtract the TCP offset
    j3_y = y
    j3_z = z - 0.09465  # Subtract the offset from joint3 to joint4
    
    # Joint 1 determines the orientation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_x, j3_z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint2 after setting theta1
    j2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    j2_y = 0
    j2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint2 to joint3
    dx = j3_x - j2_x
    dy = j3_y - j2_y
    dz = j3_z - j2_z
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint2 to joint3
    r_j2_j3 = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)
    
    # The length of the link from joint2 to joint3 is 0.093
    # If the calculated distance is different, we need to adjust theta2 and theta3
    
    # Calculate theta3 (rotation around Z)
    # This is the angle in the XY plane
    theta3 = math.atan2(dx, dy)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (rotation around Y)
    # This is the angle in the YZ plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(dy, math.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2))
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the position of joint3 relative to joint2
    if dz < 0:
        theta2 = math.pi - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I think I'm still misunderstanding the robot's structure. Let me reconsider by analyzing the correct joint values more carefully.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Joint 4 is consistently 0
2. The relationship between the other joints varies

Let me try a different approach by examining the forward kinematics more carefully:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Set joint4 to 0 as observed in all correct examples
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint4
    # With joint4 at 0, this offset remains [0, 0.0823, 0]
    
    # Calculate the position of joint4
    j4_x = x
    j4_y = y - 0.0823
    j4_z = z
    
    # Calculate the position of joint3
    # Joint3 is offset from joint4 by [0, 0, 0.09465]
    j3_x = j4_x
    j3_y = j4_y
    j3_z = j4_z - 0.09465
    
    # Joint1 determines the orientation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_x, j3_z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint2 after setting theta1
    j2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    j2_y = 0
    j2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint2 to joint3
    dx = j3_x - j2_x
    dy = j3_y - j2_y
    dz = j3_z - j2_z
    
    # Joint3 rotates around Z, which affects the XY plane
    # Calculate theta3 based on the position of joint3 relative to joint2
    theta3 = math.atan2(dx, dy)
    
    # Joint2 rotates around Y, which affects the YZ plane
    # Calculate theta2 based on the position of joint3 relative to joint2
    r_xz = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(dy, r_xz)
    
    # Adjust theta2 and theta3 based on the quadrant
    if dz < 0:
        theta2 = math.pi - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me analyze the examples more carefully and try a different approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Based on the examples, joint4 is always 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint4
    # With the 90-degree rotation around Z, we need to adjust
    
    # Calculate the position of joint3
    # Joint4 is at [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint3
    # TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint4
    # So TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0.09465] from joint3
    j3_x = x
    j3_y = y - 0.0823
    j3_z = z - 0.09465
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y at the base)
    # This determines the orientation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_x, j3_z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint2 after setting theta1
    # Joint2 is at [0, 0, 0.39225] from the base
    j2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    j2_y = 0
    j2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint2 to joint3
    dx = j3_x - j2_x
    dy = j3_y - j2_y
    dz = j3_z - j2_z
    
    # Joint3 is at [0, 0.093, 0] from joint2
    # This means the distance from joint2 to joint3 should be 0.093
    
    # Calculate theta3 (rotation around Z)
    # This affects the orientation in the XY plane
    theta3 = math.atan2(dx, dy)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (rotation around Y)
    # This affects the orientation in the YZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(dy, r_xz)
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the quadrant
    if dz < 0:
        theta2 = math.pi - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me try a completely different approach by analyzing the examples more carefully:

```python
import math

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # From the examples, joint4 is always 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint4
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y - 0.0823
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Calculate theta1 (base rotation around Y)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Transform the wrist position to the frame after joint1 rotation
    # This simplifies the problem to a 2D problem in the YZ' plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_z**2)
    
    # The distance from the base to joint2 along the Z axis is 0.39225
    # Calculate the remaining distance to the wrist in the XZ plane
    remaining_r = r_xz - 0.39225
    
    # The distance from joint2 to the wrist in the Y direction
    height = wrist_y
    
    # Calculate the straight-line distance from joint2 to the wrist
    distance = math.sqrt(remaining_r**2 + height**2)
    
    # The length of the link from joint2 to joint3 is 0.093
    # The length of the link from joint3 to joint4 is 0.09465
    link2_length = 0.093
    link3_length = 0.09465
    
    # Use the law of cosines to calculate the angle at joint3
    cos_theta3 = (link2_length**2 + link3_length**2 - distance**2) / (2 * link2_length * link3_length)
    theta3 = -math.acos(max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0))
    
    # Calculate the angle at joint2
    beta = math.atan2(height, remaining_r)
    gamma = math.acos((link2_length**2 + distance**2 - link3_length**2) / (2 * link2_length * distance))
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After careful analysis, I believe the issue is with my understanding of the robot's structure and how the joints affect the end effector position. Let me provide a final solution:

```python

    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint4 with a rotation of 90 degrees around Z
    # This means the offset is effectively [0, 0.0823, 0] in the global frame
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y - 0.0823
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Calculate theta1 (base rotation around Y)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Transform the wrist position to the frame after joint1 rotation
    # This simplifies the problem to a 2D problem in the YZ' plane
