Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 and 2 rotate around Y-axis
2. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis
4. The TCP has an offset in the Y direction and a rotation around Z-axis

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of link 1
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2
    l3 = 0.09465  # Height of link 3
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # The wrist position is different from the TCP position
    # We need to solve for the wrist position first
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, we can determine it first
    # The projection of the end effector on the XZ plane depends on joint 3
    
    # Calculate the wrist position (before the TCP offset)
    # This is a simplification since we're dealing with a 4-DOF robot
    # and the orientation is constrained
    
    # Joint 1 (base rotation around Y)
    # This affects the X and Z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joints 2, 3, and 4, we need to work in the YZ plane of joint 1
    # Project the target point onto the YZ plane of joint 1
    r = math.sqrt(x*x + z*z)  # Distance in XZ plane
    
    # The Y coordinate is directly affected by joints 2, 3, and 4
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Z) affects the X and Y in the local frame
    # which translates to a change in the global Y and r
    
    # We need to solve for theta2, theta3, and theta4
    # First, let's determine the wrist position
    # The wrist is at a distance l4 from the TCP
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, it changes the direction of the TCP offset
    # We need to solve for theta3 first
    
    # The projection of the end effector in the XZ plane depends on theta1
    # The distance from the origin to this projection is r
    
    # For a 4-DOF robot, we have one redundant DOF for positioning
    # We can use this to simplify our solution
    
    # Let's solve for theta3 (rotation around Z)
    # This joint affects the X and Y coordinates in its local frame
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, r)
    
    # Now we can solve for theta2 and theta4 (both rotate around Y)
    # These joints affect the height (Z) and the distance from the Z-axis (r)
    
    # The effective height is z - l1
    h = z - l1
    
    # The effective reach in the YZ plane is sqrt(r^2 + (y-l2)^2)
    y_eff = y - l2
    r_eff = math.sqrt(r*r + y_eff*y_eff)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    c2 = (h*h + r_eff*r_eff - l3*l3 - l4*l4) / (2 * l3 * l4)
    c2 = max(min(c2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(c2)
    
    # Now solve for theta4
    s2 = math.sin(theta2)
    k1 = l3 + l4 * c2
    k2 = l4 * s2
    
    theta4 = math.atan2(h, r_eff) - math.atan2(k2, k1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Looking at the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z)
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis (affects X and Y)
4. Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z)

Let me revise the solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

    # We can use this to simplify our solution
    
    # Let's first determine the wrist position (before the TCP offset)
    # The TCP is offset by l4 in the Y direction in the local frame of joint 4

    # Joint 3 affects the X and Y coordinates in its local frame

    r = math.sqrt(x*x + z*z)
    
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP to the wrist
    # The wrist position depends on the orientation of joint 3
    
    # Let's solve for joint 3 first using the approach from EXISTING 1
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to determine the wrist position
    # The wrist is at a distance l4 from the TCP in the local Y direction
    # This is affected by the rotation of joint 3
    
    # Calculate the wrist position
    wrist_x = x - l4 * math.sin(theta3)
    wrist_y = y - l4 * math.cos(theta3)
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Now we can solve for joints 1, 2, and 4 using the approach from EXISTING 2
    # But we need to adapt it for our specific robot
    
    # Joint 1 affects the overall orientation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    
    # Joints 2 and 4 affect the height and reach
    # We can use the law of cosines to solve for these
    
    # The effective height is wrist_z - l1
    h = wrist_z - l1
    
    # The effective reach in the YZ plane
    y_eff = wrist_y - l2

    # Now solve for theta4
    theta4 = 0  # Placeholder
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it once more based on a clearer understanding of the robot structure:

```python
import math

```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me take a step back and analyze the robot structure more carefully based on the forward kinematics tests.

After careful analysis of the forward kinematics tests and the robot structure, I'll provide a complete solution:

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me make one final revision based on a clearer understanding of the robot structure:
