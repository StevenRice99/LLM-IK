I apologize for the error in my code. Let me fix the issue and provide a correct solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint4 is consistently set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Transform the target to the plane defined by joint 1
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Account for the TCP offset
    # Since joint 4 is fixed at 0, the TCP is offset from joint 4 by l4 in the Y direction
    wrist_y = y - l4
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in the original coordinate system
    j2_y = 0
    j2_z = l1
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to the target
    dr = r
    dy = wrist_y - j2_y
    dz = 0 - j2_z
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2 (around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle in the plane defined by joint 1
    theta2 = math.atan2(dr, dz)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 after joint 2 has rotated
    j3_r = l1 * math.sin(theta2)
    j3_y = l2
    j3_z = l1 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 3 to the target
    dr_j3 = r - j3_r
    dy_j3 = wrist_y - j3_y
    dz_j3 = 0 - j3_z
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 3 to the target
    d_j3 = math.sqrt(dr_j3**2 + dy_j3**2 + dz_j3**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 3 (around Z-axis)
    # This is the angle between the vector from joint 3 to the target
    # and the plane perpendicular to the Z-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(dy_j3, math.sqrt(dr_j3**2 + dz_j3**2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I don't see any issue with the code I provided. Let me double-check and provide a completely revised solution to ensure there are no errors:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint4 is consistently set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Transform the target to the plane defined by joint 1
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    wrist_y = y - l4
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 in the original coordinate system
    j2_y = 0
    j2_z = l1
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to the target
    dr = r
    dy = wrist_y - j2_y
    dz = 0 - j2_z
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2 (around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle in the plane defined by joint 1
    theta2 = math.atan2(dr, dz)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 after joint 2 has rotated
    j3_r = l1 * math.sin(theta2)
    j3_y = l2
    j3_z = l1 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 3 to the target
    dr_j3 = r - j3_r
    dy_j3 = wrist_y - j3_y
    dz_j3 = 0 - j3_z

    theta3 = math.atan2(dy_j3, math.sqrt(dr_j3**2 + dz_j3**2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I don't see any issue with the code where `theta2` would be undefined. Let me try a completely different approach to ensure there are no errors:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Z-offset from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y-offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Z-offset from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y-offset from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Joint 4 is set to 0 based on the feedback
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target onto the plane defined by joint 1
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Account for the TCP offset in the Y direction
    target_y = y - l4
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle between the Z-axis and the line to the target in the plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, l1)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 after joint 2 has rotated
    j3_x = l1 * math.sin(theta2)
    j3_y = l2
    j3_z = l1 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 3 to the target
    dx = r - j3_x
    dy = target_y - j3_y
    dz = 0 - j3_z
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This is the angle between the XZ plane and the line to the target
    theta3 = math.atan2(dy, math.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```
