Thank you for the additional feedback. I notice that my solution is still not working correctly. Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I see that I'm still misunderstanding some aspects of the robot's kinematics.

Let me analyze the examples more carefully:

1. In some cases, theta2 is positive, and in others, it's negative
2. Similarly, theta3 can be either positive or negative
3. There seems to be a relationship between theta2 and theta3 that I'm not capturing correctly

Let me revise my solution with a more careful analysis:

```python
import math

    """

    x, y, z = p
    
    # From the examples, joint4 is always 0
    theta4 = 0.0

    # Calculate the angle at joint2
    beta = math.atan2(dy, r_proj)
    gamma = math.acos((link2_length**2 + distance**2 - link3_length**2) / (2 * link2_length * distance))

    # and vice versa
    
    # Determine the correct configuration based on the target position

    # If the target is below the XZ plane (y < 0), use the other configuration

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me try a different approach by analyzing the examples more systematically:
