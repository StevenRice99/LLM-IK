I see that my solution is still not working correctly. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully and develop a better solution.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with the target positions, I notice several patterns:

1. Joint 4 is consistently 0 in all correct solutions
2. Joint 3 can be positive or negative
3. Joint 2 can be positive or negative
4. There seems to be a specific relationship between the target position and the joint angles

Let me try a completely different approach based on the examples provided:
