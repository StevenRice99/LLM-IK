I'll now develop a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of this 4-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and forward kinematics results to derive the solution.

Based on the provided information and forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
1. The robot has 4 revolute joints, with joints 1, 2, and 4 rotating around the Y-axis, and joint 3 rotating around the Z-axis
2. The TCP (Tool Center Point) has a fixed orientation offset relative to the last link

Let me work through the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

First, I'll analyze the kinematic chain:
- Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at origin [0,0,0]
- Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at [0,0,0.39225]
- Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis at [0,0.093,0.39225]
- Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis at [0,0.093,0.4869]
- TCP is at [0,0.1753,0.4869] with orientation offset [0,0,1.5708]

To solve the inverse kinematics, I need to find the joint angles that place the TCP at the desired position p = [x, y, z].

Here's my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of joint 3 in y direction
    l3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 4
    # Since the TCP has an orientation offset around Z, we need to adjust for this
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 (wrist center)
    # The TCP is offset by l4 in the y direction from joint 4 when all joints are at 0
    # We need to account for the rotation of this offset based on joint 3
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    # Joint 1 determines the x-y plane orientation
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # The distance from the origin to the target in the x-y plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Adjust for the TCP offset in y direction
    # When joint 3 = 0, the TCP is offset by l4 in the y direction
    # We need to find the wrist center position
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta1)
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center in the x-y plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_y**2)
    
    # Height of wrist center relative to joint 2
    s = wrist_z - l1
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + s**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find joint 2 angle using the law of sines
    beta = np.arctan2(s, r)
    gamma = np.arcsin(l3 * np.sin(theta3) / d)
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Joint 4 angle (wrist angle)
    # This ensures the TCP reaches the target position
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. The above solution has some issues with the geometric interpretation. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of joint 3 in y direction
    l3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 4)
    # We need to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by l4 in the y direction from joint 4 when all joints are at 0
    # When joint 3 rotates, this offset changes direction
    
    # Distance from origin to target in x-y plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # For simplicity, let's first solve for the case where joint 3 = 0
    # In this case, the wrist center is at:
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y - l4
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Now we can solve for joints 2 and 3 using the wrist center position
    # The distance from joint 2 to wrist center in the x-y plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_y**2)
    
    # Height of wrist center relative to joint 2
    s = wrist_z - l1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle using law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range

    # Calculate joint 2 angle
    alpha = np.arctan2(s, r)
    beta = np.arcsin(l3 * np.sin(theta3) / d)

    # Joint 4 angle (wrist angle)
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not fully satisfied with this solution. Let me revise it one more time to ensure it's correct:

```python

    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (joint 4)

    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, and the TCP has an offset in the Y direction,
    # we need to calculate the wrist center position
    
    # First, calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the x-y plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The wrist center is at a distance l4 from the TCP
    # We need to account for the orientation of the TCP

    # when all joints are at 0
    
    # When joint 3 rotates, this offset changes direction
    # For simplicity, let's assume joint 3 = 0 initially
    
    # Calculate wrist center position
    wrist_x = x
    wrist_y = y - l4
    wrist_z = z
    
    # Now we can solve for joints 2, 3, and 4
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to wrist center in the x-y plane
    r = np.sqrt(wrist_x**2 + wrist_y**2)

    # Joint 4 angle (wrist angle)
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to reconsider the geometry more carefully. Let me provide the final solution:

After careful consideration of the robot's geometry, I believe there's still an issue with my approach. Let me provide the correct solution:
