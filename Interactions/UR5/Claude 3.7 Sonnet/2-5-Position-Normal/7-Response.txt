Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has several issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values, I notice a pattern: the fourth joint (joint4) is consistently 0 in all the correct solutions. This suggests that the robot might be using a specific configuration where the fourth joint is kept at zero.

Let me revise my approach completely based on this insight and the robot's geometry:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot geometry
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2 from base
    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of joint 3 in y direction
    l3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Set joint 4 to 0 as observed in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    # This determines the orientation in the x-y plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Since joint 4 is fixed at 0, we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # to position the TCP at the target
    
    # The TCP is at a fixed offset from joint 4
    # When joint 4 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l4 in the y direction
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 4 (which is the wrist center)
    # We need to work backwards from the target position
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by l4 in the local y direction
    # Due to the orientation of joint 3, this offset is rotated
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the x-y plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around the Z axis, it affects the orientation
    # of the TCP offset relative to joint 4
    
    # We need to solve for joint 3 first, then determine joint 2
    # Since joint 4 is 0, the orientation of the end effector is determined by joint 3
    
    # The TCP position is determined by the position of joint 4 plus the offset
    # When joint 3 = 0, the TCP is offset by l4 in the y direction
    # When joint 3 rotates, this offset rotates in the x-y plane
    
    # We can use the law of cosines to find the angle of joint 3
    # First, calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    dx = r_xy - l2  # Horizontal distance from joint 2 to target in x-y plane
    dz = z - l1     # Vertical distance from joint 2 to target
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    d = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dz**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3
    # The triangle is formed by joint 2, joint 4, and the target
    # The sides are: l3 (joint 2 to joint 4), l4 (joint 4 to TCP), and d (joint 2 to target)
    cos_theta3 = (l3**2 + l4**2 - d**2) / (2 * l3 * l4)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z, so positive rotation is counterclockwise
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now we can find joint 2
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y, so positive rotation is counterclockwise when viewed from the right
    # We need to find the angle between the horizontal and the line from joint 2 to joint 4
    
    # First, find the position of joint 4
    # When joint 3 = 0, joint 4 is at (l2, 0, l1 + l3)
    # When joint 3 rotates, joint 4 moves in a circle around joint 3
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    # This is the angle between the horizontal and the line from joint 2 to the target
    theta2 = np.arctan2(dz, dx)
    
    # Adjust joint 2 based on the angle of joint 3
    # The angle between the line from joint 2 to joint 4 and the line from joint 4 to the target
    beta = np.arcsin(l4 * np.sin(theta3) / d)
    
    # Adjust joint 2
    theta2 = theta2 - beta
    
    # Based on the examples, it seems joint 3 might need to be negated
    theta3 = -theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """

    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p

    l4 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Set joint 4 to 0 as observed in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Since joint 1 rotates around Y, we need to transform the target point
    # to the plane of joints 2, 3, and 4 after joint 1 rotation
    x_transformed = x * np.cos(theta1) + y * np.sin(theta1)
    y_transformed = -x * np.sin(theta1) + y * np.cos(theta1)
    z_transformed = z
    
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3 to position the TCP at the target
    # The TCP is at a fixed offset from joint 4
    # When joint 4 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l4 in the y direction
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Z, it affects the orientation of the TCP
    # We need to find the angle of joint 3 that orients the TCP correctly
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target in the x-y plane
    r = np.sqrt(x_transformed**2 + y_transformed**2) - l2
    
    # The height of the target relative to joint 2
    s = z_transformed - l1
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3
    # The triangle is formed by joint 2, joint 4, and the target
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l3**2 - l4**2) / (2 * l3 * l4)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z, so positive rotation is counterclockwise
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now we can find joint 2
    # Joint 2 rotates around Y, so positive rotation is counterclockwise when viewed from the right
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    # This is the angle between the horizontal and the line from joint 2 to the target
    alpha = np.arctan2(s, r)
    
    # Adjust joint 2 based on the angle of joint 3
    # The angle between the line from joint 2 to joint 4 and the line from joint 4 to the target
    beta = np.arcsin(l4 * np.sin(theta3) / d)
    
    # Adjust joint 2
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Based on the examples, it seems joint 3 might need to be negated
    theta3 = -theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me revise it one more time:

```python

    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
