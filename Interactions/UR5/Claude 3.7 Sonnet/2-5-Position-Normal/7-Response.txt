I'll solve the inverse kinematics for this 4-DOF serial manipulator step by step. Let me analyze the robot structure first based on the forward kinematics results.

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS results, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
- Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at height 0.39225
- Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis with offset (0, 0.093, 0) from joint 2
- Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis with offset (0, 0, 0.09465) from joint 3
- The TCP has offset (0, 0.0823, 0) from joint 4

Let me derive the closed-form solution:

### Step 1: Analyze the kinematic chain
When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at (0, 0.1753, 0.4869).

### Step 2: Derive the inverse kinematics equations
For a given target position p = (x, y, z), I need to find joint angles (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, θ₄).

### Step 3: Solve for joint angles

First, I'll solve for θ₃ (joint 3) which rotates around Z-axis and affects the x-y plane position.

The position of the wrist center (before joint 4 and TCP offset) can be calculated by:
- Wrist center = Target position - TCP offset (rotated by joint angles)

Since joint 3 rotates around Z-axis, it creates a rotation in the XY plane. The angle θ₃ can be determined from the x and y coordinates.

Joint 1 and 2 (both rotating around Y-axis) affect the robot's reach in the XZ plane.

Joint 4 (also rotating around Y-axis) affects the final orientation of the TCP.

Here's the complete solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Height between joint 3 and 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center (before TCP offset)
    # When θ₃ = 0, the TCP offset is in the Y direction
    # When θ₃ ≠ 0, the TCP offset is rotated in the XY plane
    
    # Calculate θ₃ first (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This affects the x and y coordinates
    if abs(x) < 1e-10:  # Avoid division by zero
        if y > l2 + l4:
            theta3 = 0  # TCP is directly in front
        else:
            theta3 = np.pi  # TCP is directly behind
    else:
        theta3 = np.arctan2(x, y - l2)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center position by removing the TCP offset
    wc_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta3)
    wc_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta3)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the XY plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + (wc_y - l2)**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    r = np.sqrt(r_xy**2 + (wc_z - l1)**2)
    
    # Calculate θ₁ (base rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle needed to align the arm with the wrist center in the XZ plane
    theta1 = np.arcsin((wc_z - l1) / r)
    
    # Calculate θ₂ (second joint rotation around Y-axis)
    # This complements θ₁ to reach the correct height
    theta2 = np.arcsin(r_xy / r) - theta1
    
    # Calculate θ₄ (wrist rotation around Y-axis)
    # This ensures the TCP reaches the target position
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at height 0.39225
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis with offset (0, 0.093, 0) from joint 2
4. Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis with offset (0, 0, 0.09465) from joint 3

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Z)
    theta3 = np.arctan2(x, y - l2)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center by removing the TCP offset (rotated by theta3)
    wc_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta3)
    wc_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta3)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Calculate the projection of the arm in the XY plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + (wc_y - l2)**2)
    
    # Calculate the total arm length from joint 2 to wrist center
    r = np.sqrt(r_xy**2 + (wc_z - l1)**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle from horizontal to the wrist center from joint 2
    phi = np.arctan2(wc_z - l1, r_xy)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 and 2 angles (both rotate around Y)
    # These two joints work together to position the arm in the right direction
    theta1 = phi
    theta2 = np.arcsin((r - l3) / r) - theta1
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle (rotation around Y)
    # This ensures the TCP reaches the target position
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After further analysis, I need to make one more revision to correctly handle the kinematics:

```python

    """

    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Z)
    theta3 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center by removing the TCP offset (rotated by theta3)
    wc_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta3)
    wc_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta3)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Distance from origin to wrist center in XY plane
    r_xy = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y at base)
    # This tilts the arm up/down to reach the correct height
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wc_z - l1, r_xy - l2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    d = np.sqrt((wc_z - l1)**2 + (r_xy - l2)**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Y)
    theta2 = np.arcsin((d**2 + l3**2 - d**2) / (2 * d * l3))
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle (rotation around Y)
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Let me make one final revision to ensure the solution is correct:

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)

After careful analysis of the robot structure and kinematics, here's my final solution:
