I apologize for the error in my solution. Let me correct the inverse kinematics function by ensuring all variables are properly defined before they're used. I'll develop a more careful step-by-step solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Height between joint 3 and 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # First, calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Z)
    # This joint rotates in the XY plane
    theta3 = np.arctan2(x, y - l2)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center by removing the TCP offset (rotated by theta3)
    wc_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta3)
    wc_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta3)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Calculate the projection in XY plane from origin to wrist center
    r_xy = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + (wc_y - l2)**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y at base)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wc_z - l1, r_xy)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    d = np.sqrt((wc_z - l1)**2 + r_xy**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Y)
    # Using the law of sines to determine the angle
    theta2 = np.arcsin(d / l3) - theta1
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle (rotation around Y)
    # This ensures the end effector reaches the target position
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully and develop a more accurate solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Height between joint 3 and 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center by removing the TCP offset
    # When all joints are at 0, the TCP is offset in the Y direction
    # We need to account for the rotation caused by joint 3 (around Z-axis)
    
    # First, calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    r_xy_target = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Z)
    # This affects how the TCP offset is projected
    theta3 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center by removing the TCP offset (rotated by theta3)
    wc_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta3)
    wc_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta3)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Calculate the projection in XY plane from origin to wrist center
    r_xy = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + (wc_y - l2)**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to wrist center
    d = np.sqrt((wc_z - l1)**2 + r_xy**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y at base)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wc_z - l1, r_xy)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Y)
    # Using the law of sines to determine the angle
    theta2 = np.arcsin(d / l3) - theta1
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle (rotation around Y)
    # This ensures the end effector reaches the target position
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

I need to be more careful with the geometry. Let me revise once more:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Height between joint 3 and 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at (0, 0.1753, 0.4869)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Z)
    # This joint determines the orientation in the XY plane
    theta3 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center by removing the TCP offset (rotated by theta3)
    wc_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta3)
    wc_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta3)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance from the base to the wrist center
    r_xy = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y at base)
    # This tilts the arm up/down to reach the correct height
    theta1 = np.arctan2(wc_z - l1, r_xy)
    
    # Calculate the straight-line distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    d = np.sqrt((wc_z - l1)**2 + r_xy**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Y)
    # This extends the arm to reach the target distance
    theta2 = np.arcsin(d / (l3 + l2)) - theta1
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle (rotation around Y)
    # This ensures the end effector reaches the target position
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

After careful reconsideration of the robot's geometry, here's my final solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.39225  # Height of joint 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Height between joint 3 and 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP from joint 4
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Z)
    theta3 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the wrist center by removing the TCP offset (rotated by theta3)
    wc_x = x - l4 * np.sin(theta3)
    wc_y = y - l4 * np.cos(theta3)
    wc_z = z
    
    # Calculate the horizontal distance from the base to the wrist center
    r_xy = np.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_y**2)
    
    # Calculate the vertical distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    h = wc_z - l1
    
    # Calculate the straight-line distance from joint 2 to the wrist center
    d = np.sqrt(h**2 + r_xy**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y at base)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(h, r_xy)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Y)
    # Using the law of cosines: d² = l2² + l3² - 2*l2*l3*cos(π-theta2)
    # Rearranging to solve for theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta2 = np.pi - np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0))
    
    # Calculate joint 4 angle (rotation around Y)
    theta4 = -theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```
