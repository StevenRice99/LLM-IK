I see that my solution is still not working correctly. Let me analyze the correct joint values more carefully and develop a better solution.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with the target positions, I notice that:

1. Joint 4 is consistently 0 in all correct solutions
2. Joint 3 can be positive or negative
3. Joint 2 can be positive or negative
4. The relationship between joints 2 and 3 is not as simple as I initially thought

Let me revise my approach completely:

```python

    l2 = 0.093    # Offset of joint 3 in y direction
    l3 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 3 to joint 4
    l4 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 4 to TCP
    
    # Set joint 4 to 0 as observed in the correct solutions
    theta4 = 0
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (base rotation)
    # This determines the orientation in the x-y plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, y)
    
    # Since we know joint 4 is 0, we need to find the position of the TCP
    # when joint 4 is at 0
    
    # The TCP is offset from joint 4 by l4 in the y direction when all joints are at 0
    # When joint 3 rotates, this offset changes direction
    
    # We need to work backwards from the target position to find the position of joint 3

    # Now we need to find the values of joint 2 and joint 3 that place the TCP at the target

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me try a completely different approach:
