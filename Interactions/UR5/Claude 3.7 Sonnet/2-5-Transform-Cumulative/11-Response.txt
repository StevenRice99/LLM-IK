Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the results from the forward kinematics tests:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
4. Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis
5. The TCP has an orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.570796325] (approximately π/2 around Z-axis)

Here's my solution for the inverse kinematics:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Adjust for the TCP offset (0, 0.0823, 0) and orientation offset (0, 0, π/2)
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP to the wrist (joint 4)
    
    # Create rotation matrices
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)],
            [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([
            [np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-np.sin(angle), 0, np.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([
            [np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle), 0],
            [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    
    # Target orientation matrix
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Adjust for the TCP orientation offset (0, 0, π/2)
    tcp_offset = rot_z(1.570796325)
    R_wrist = R_target @ np.linalg.inv(tcp_offset)
    
    # Calculate wrist position by subtracting the TCP offset vector transformed by the orientation
    tcp_offset_vec = np.array([0, 0.0823, 0])
    wrist_pos = np.array([x, y, z]) - R_target @ tcp_offset_vec
    
    # Now we can solve for the joint angles
    
    # Joint 1: Rotation around Y-axis
    # This affects the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_pos[0], wrist_pos[2])
    
    # Apply joint 1 rotation to get the position relative to joint 2
    R1 = rot_y(theta1)
    pos_rel_to_j1 = R1.T @ wrist_pos
    
    # Joint 2: Rotation around Y-axis
    # We need to consider the offset from joint 1 to joint 2 (0, 0, 0.39225)
    j1_to_j2_offset = np.array([0, 0, 0.39225])
    pos_rel_to_j2 = pos_rel_to_j1 - j1_to_j2_offset
    
    # Calculate distance from joint 2 to wrist
    # Link lengths: joint2 to joint3 = (0, 0.093, 0), joint3 to joint4 = (0, 0, 0.09465)
    l1 = 0.093  # y-offset from joint2 to joint3
    l2 = 0.09465  # z-offset from joint3 to joint4
    
    # Calculate the projection of the position onto the YZ plane
    y_proj = pos_rel_to_j2[1]
    z_proj = pos_rel_to_j2[2]
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle using atan2
    theta2 = math.atan2(-z_proj, y_proj)
    
    # Joint 3: Rotation around Z-axis
    # Extract the orientation component for joint 3
    R1_inv = np.linalg.inv(rot_y(theta1))
    R2_inv = np.linalg.inv(rot_y(theta2))
    R3 = R1_inv @ R_wrist @ R2_inv
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(R3[1, 0], R3[0, 0])
    
    # Joint 4: Rotation around Y-axis
    # Extract the orientation component for joint 4
    R3_inv = np.linalg.inv(rot_z(theta3))
    R4 = R2_inv @ R3_inv @ R1_inv @ R_wrist
    
    # Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis
    theta4 = math.atan2(-R4[2, 0], R4[2, 2])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates the wrist position by accounting for the TCP offset
2. Solves for joint 1 angle using the wrist position
3. Transforms the wrist position to be relative to joint 2
4. Solves for joint 2 angle
5. Extracts the orientation components for joints 3 and 4
6. Solves for joint 3 and 4 angles

The solution handles the kinematic chain properly, accounting for all the offsets and rotations in the robot structure.
