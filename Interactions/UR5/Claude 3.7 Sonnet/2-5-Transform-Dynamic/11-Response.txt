Thank you for the feedback. I can see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I need to completely revise my approach. Let me implement a more accurate solution:
