Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for the 4-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and develop the solution step by step.

From the DETAILS and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around Y axis
- Joint 2 rotates around Y axis
- Joint 3 rotates around Z axis
- Joint 4 rotates around Y axis
- The TCP has a fixed orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.570796325] (π/2 around Z)

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
