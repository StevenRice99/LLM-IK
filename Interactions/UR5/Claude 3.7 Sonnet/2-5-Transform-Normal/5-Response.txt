I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 4-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the equations step by step.

Based on the forward kinematics results, I can see that this is a 4-DOF robot with revolute joints. Let's analyze the structure:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis at the base
2. Joint 2 rotates around Y-axis at z=0.39225
3. Joint 3 rotates around Z-axis with offset (0, 0.093, 0)
4. Joint 4 rotates around Y-axis with offset (0, 0, 0.09465)
5. TCP has offset (0, 0.0823, 0) and orientation offset of 1.57 rad around Z

Let me derive the inverse kinematics solution:

```python

    # Calculate joint 4 angle based on the desired pitch

Wait, I need to refine this solution. There are some issues with the approach. Let me reconsider the problem:
