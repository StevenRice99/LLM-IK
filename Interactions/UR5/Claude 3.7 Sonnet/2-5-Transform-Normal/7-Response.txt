Based on the feedback, I can see that my inverse kinematics solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a more accurate solution.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I notice several key problems:
1. My solution isn't properly handling the joint 2 angle calculation
2. The relationship between joints and the end-effector position/orientation isn't correctly modeled
3. I need to better understand the robot's kinematic structure

Let me develop a correct solution:
