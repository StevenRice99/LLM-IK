Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the results from the forward kinematics tests:

1. The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis
2. The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Z-axis
3. The TCP is offset from joint 2 by [0, 0, 0.09465]

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see how the joint angles affect the TCP position:
- When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
- When joint 1 is at π/2 (1.57) and joint 2 is at 0, the TCP is at [0.09465, 0.093, ~0]
- When joint 1 is at 0 and joint 2 is at π/2 (1.57), the TCP position doesn't change

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # The y-coordinate is fixed by the robot structure at 0.093
    # If the target y is not 0.093, we can't reach it exactly
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the distribution of the TCP position between x and z
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This joint doesn't affect the TCP position in this robot configuration
    joint2 = 0.0
    
    # The distance from the base to the TCP in the XZ plane should match
    # the length of the second link plus TCP (0.09465)
    tcp_length = 0.09465
    xz_distance = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # If the calculated distance doesn't match the TCP length, adjust joint1
    if not np.isclose(xz_distance, tcp_length):
        # We need to adjust our calculation
        # The TCP is at a fixed distance from joint 2
        joint1 = np.arcsin(x / tcp_length)
        
        # Handle the case where z could be negative
        if z < 0:
            joint1 = np.pi - joint1
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
2. When joint 1 is at π/2, the TCP is at [0.09465, 0.093, ~0]
3. Joint 2 doesn't seem to affect the position in the tests

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # The TCP is at a fixed distance from the base in the XZ plane
    tcp_length = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 2 doesn't affect the position in this robot configuration
    joint2 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Actually, I need to reconsider this again. The robot has 2 DOF, so both joints must contribute to the positioning. Let me complete the solution correctly:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # The first joint rotates around the Y-axis
    # This affects the distribution of the TCP position between x and z
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # The second joint rotates around the Z-axis
    # This would affect the y position, but from the tests it seems
    # the y position is fixed at 0.093
    # Since we're assuming all targets are reachable, we'll set joint2
    # to maintain the y position at 0.093
    joint2 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
