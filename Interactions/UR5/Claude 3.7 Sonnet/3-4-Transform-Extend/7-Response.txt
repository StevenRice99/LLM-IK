I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's behavior.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can observe:
1. When both joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
2. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0, the TCP is at [0.09465, 0.093, ~0]
3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2), the TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.09465] with orientation [0, 0, 1.57]

Based on these observations and the robot description:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis
- The TCP is offset from joint 2 by [0, 0, 0.09465]

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis and affects the position in the XZ plane
    # Calculate joint 1 angle using atan2
    joint1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis and directly corresponds to the Z-rotation in the orientation
    joint2 = rz
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to verify this solution. Let me think through this more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis, which affects the position of the TCP in the XZ plane
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis, which affects the orientation of the TCP

The solution I provided assumes a direct mapping between joint angles and the final position/orientation, but I need to account for the link offsets and the kinematic chain.

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    joint1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the Z-rotation in the orientation
    joint2 = rz
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
