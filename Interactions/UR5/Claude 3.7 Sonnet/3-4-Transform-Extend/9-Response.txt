I see the issue with my solution. The inverse kinematics is more complex than I initially thought. Let me analyze the feedback and develop a correct solution.

Looking at the failed test cases, I notice that my approach of directly using the orientation's Z component (rz) as joint2 is incorrect. The orientation of the end effector is influenced by both joint angles in a more complex way.

Let me develop a proper solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation
    
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, calculate joint1 based on the position
    joint1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Create rotation matrix from the target orientation
    target_rotation = Rotation.from_euler('xyz', [rx, ry, rz])
    target_matrix = target_rotation.as_matrix()
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint1
    joint1_rotation = Rotation.from_euler('y', joint1)
    joint1_matrix = joint1_rotation.as_matrix()
    
    # Calculate the rotation needed for joint2
    # We need to find the rotation that, when combined with joint1's rotation,
    # gives us the target rotation
    joint1_inv = np.transpose(joint1_matrix)  # Inverse of rotation matrix is its transpose
    joint2_matrix = np.matmul(joint1_inv, target_matrix)
    
    # Extract joint2 angle from this matrix
    joint2_rotation = Rotation.from_matrix(joint2_matrix)
    joint2_euler = joint2_rotation.as_euler('xyz')
    joint2 = joint2_euler[2]  # Z-axis rotation
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I see an issue with my approach. The scipy.spatial.transform module might not be available in the testing environment. Let me rewrite the solution using only math and numpy:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 based on the position in the XZ plane
    joint1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # For joint2, we need to consider how it affects the orientation
    # The final orientation is a combination of joint1 and joint2 rotations
    
    # Convert Euler angles to rotation matrix
    def euler_to_rotation_matrix(euler_angles):
        x, y, z = euler_angles
        # Rotation matrix for X-axis
        Rx = np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, math.cos(x), -math.sin(x)],
            [0, math.sin(x), math.cos(x)]
        ])
        # Rotation matrix for Y-axis
        Ry = np.array([
            [math.cos(y), 0, math.sin(y)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-math.sin(y), 0, math.cos(y)]
        ])
        # Rotation matrix for Z-axis
        Rz = np.array([
            [math.cos(z), -math.sin(z), 0],
            [math.sin(z), math.cos(z), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
        # Combined rotation matrix
        return np.matmul(np.matmul(Rz, Ry), Rx)
    
    # Target rotation matrix
    target_matrix = euler_to_rotation_matrix([rx, ry, rz])
    
    # Joint1 rotation matrix (around Y-axis)
    joint1_matrix = np.array([
        [math.cos(joint1), 0, math.sin(joint1)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(joint1), 0, math.cos(joint1)]
    ])
    
    # Calculate joint2 rotation matrix
    joint1_inv = np.transpose(joint1_matrix)  # Inverse of rotation matrix
    joint2_matrix = np.matmul(joint1_inv, target_matrix)
    
    # Extract joint2 angle from the rotation matrix
    # For a rotation around Z-axis, we can extract the angle from the matrix elements
    joint2 = math.atan2(joint2_matrix[1, 0], joint2_matrix[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Actually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me simplify and focus on the specific robot configuration:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    joint1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Joint 2 is the difference between the target orientation and joint1's contribution
    # Since joint1 rotates around Y and joint2 around Z, we need to consider how they combine
    # The final orientation's Z component is influenced by both joints
    
    # Convert Euler angles to a more usable form
    # For this specific robot, joint2 needs to be calculated based on the target orientation
    # and the effect of joint1
    
    # Since joint1 rotates around Y and joint2 around Z, the final orientation is a composition
    # of these rotations. We need to "undo" the effect of joint1 to find joint2.
    
    # For this specific robot configuration:
    joint2 = rz - joint1
    
    # Normalize joint2 to be within [-π, π]
    joint2 = (joint2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, that's still not right. Let me think about this more carefully...

Based on the robot description and the failed test cases, I need to understand how the joint angles relate to the final orientation. Let me try a different approach:

```python

    """

    joint1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # For this robot, the orientation is determined by both joints
    # We need to extract joint2 from the target orientation
    
    # Convert the target orientation to a rotation matrix
    def euler_to_matrix(roll, pitch, yaw):
        # Roll (X), Pitch (Y), Yaw (Z)
        Rx = np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, np.cos(roll), -np.sin(roll)],
            [0, np.sin(roll), np.cos(roll)]
        ])
        Ry = np.array([
            [np.cos(pitch), 0, np.sin(pitch)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-np.sin(pitch), 0, np.cos(pitch)]
        ])
        Rz = np.array([
            [np.cos(yaw), -np.sin(yaw), 0],
            [np.sin(yaw), np.cos(yaw), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
        return np.dot(Rz, np.dot(Ry, Rx))
    
    # Target rotation matrix
    R_target = euler_to_matrix(rx, ry, rz)
    
    # Joint1 rotation matrix (around Y-axis)
    R_joint1 = np.array([
        [np.cos(joint1), 0, np.sin(joint1)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-np.sin(joint1), 0, np.cos(joint1)]
    ])
    
    # The rotation caused by joint2 is R_joint2 = R_joint1^-1 * R_target
    R_joint2 = np.dot(R_joint1.T, R_target)
    
    # Extract the angle for joint2 (rotation around Z)
    joint2 = np.arctan2(R_joint2[1, 0], R_joint2[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Let me simplify this further based on the specific robot configuration:
