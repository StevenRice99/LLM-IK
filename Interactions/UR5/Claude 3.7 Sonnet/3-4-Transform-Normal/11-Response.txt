I see that my previous approach was still incorrect. Let me analyze the feedback more carefully to understand the relationship between joint angles and the final orientation.

Looking at the examples more systematically:

Example 1:
- Position: [-0.09315733130560201, 0.093, 0.016743181418665]
- Orientation: [-1.319143311229048, -0.7807161950196241, 1.391786813076239]
- Correct joints: [-1.392964779093036, 0.774078871620946]

Example 2:
- Position: [0.006893192914867, 0.093, 0.094398656724757]
- Orientation: [-0.065174723313855, 0.032666854658746004, -1.106812140585839]
- Correct joints: [0.072892773722811, -1.105747142390917]

Let me analyze the relationship between the joint angles and the final orientation more carefully.

The robot has:
1. Joint 1 rotating around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotating around Z-axis
3. TCP at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 2

When I look at the examples, I notice that:
- Joint 1 (θ₁) is consistently calculated as atan2(x, z), which is correct for the position
- Joint 2 (θ₂) seems to have a direct relationship with the z-component of the orientation (rz)

Let me try a different approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2, looking at the examples:
    # Example 1: joint2 = 0.774078871620946, rz = 1.391786813076239, joint1 = -1.392964779093036
    # Example 2: joint2 = -1.105747142390917, rz = -1.106812140585839, joint1 = 0.072892773722811
    
    # It appears that joint2 is approximately equal to rz when joint1 is close to 0
    # When joint1 is not close to 0, there's a relationship between them
    
    # Let's try: joint2 = rz - joint1
    # For Example 1: 0.774078871620946 ≈ 1.391786813076239 - (-1.392964779093036) = 2.784751592169275
    # This doesn't match
    
    # Let's try: joint2 = rz
    # For Example 1: 0.774078871620946 ≠ 1.391786813076239
    # This doesn't match either
    
    # Looking at more examples:
    # Example 3: joint2 = -2.553397053217423, rz = -1.049455298202144, joint1 = -1.963898744055831
    # Example 4: joint2 = 2.038124293865086, rz = 2.000274936390421, joint1 = 0.43323137074223306
    
    # Let's try a different relationship:
    # For Example 1: joint2 = 0.774078871620946, rz = 1.391786813076239, joint1 = -1.392964779093036
    # If we try: joint2 = rz - joint1, we get: 1.391786813076239 - (-1.392964779093036) = 2.784751592169275
    # This is not correct
    
    # Let's try: joint2 = rz - 2*joint1
    # For Example 1: 1.391786813076239 - 2*(-1.392964779093036) = 4.177716371262311
    # This is not correct either
    
    # After analyzing the examples, it appears that:
    # The relationship is not a simple linear combination
    
    # Let's try a different approach based on the robot's kinematics:
    # Since joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis, it directly contributes to the Z-orientation
    # However, joint 1 also affects the final orientation
    
    # From the examples, it seems that:
    joint2 = rz
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-π, π]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi)) - np.pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Let me check this against the examples:

Example 1:
- rz = 1.391786813076239
- joint2 = 0.774078871620946

Example 2:
- rz = -1.106812140585839
- joint2 = -1.105747142390917

These are close but not exact. Let me try one more approach:

```python

    """

    # The relationship seems to vary. Let's try a different approach.
