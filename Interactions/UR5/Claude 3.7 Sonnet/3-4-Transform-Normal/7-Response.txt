Let me analyze the robot kinematics based on the information provided and the forward kinematics test results.

From the details and test results, I can see that:
1. The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis
2. The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Z-axis
3. The TCP is positioned at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to Revolute 2

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

First, I'll analyze what happens with different joint configurations:

1. When both joints are at 0 (θ₁=0, θ₂=0):
   - TCP position is [0, 0.093, 0.09465]

2. When θ₁=1.57 (90°) and θ₂=0:
   - TCP position is approximately [0.09465, 0.093, 0.000075]
   - This shows that rotating joint 1 moves the TCP in the X-Z plane

3. When θ₁=0 and θ₂=1.57 (90°):
   - TCP position is [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
   - The orientation changes but not the position

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # The y-coordinate is fixed by the robot geometry
    # The TCP is always at y = 0.093 regardless of joint angles
    
    # For joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis):
    # This affects the x and z coordinates
    # When θ₁ = 0, TCP is at [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
    # When θ₁ = π/2, TCP is at [0.09465, 0.093, 0]
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle using atan2
    # We need to consider that the z-coordinate is offset by 0.09465 when θ₁ = 0
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis) only affects orientation
    # The orientation around z-axis is directly controlled by joint2
    joint2 = r[2]  # Extract the z-component of the orientation
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to refine this solution. Let me test another configuration to better understand the kinematics.
