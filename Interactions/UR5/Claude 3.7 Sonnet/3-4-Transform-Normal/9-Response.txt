I see the issue with my previous approach. The inverse kinematics solution needs to account for both position and orientation correctly. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully and develop a complete solution.

From the details provided:
1. Joint 1 (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis
2. Joint 2 (Revolute 2) rotates around the Z-axis
3. The TCP is positioned at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to Revolute 2
4. Revolute 2 is positioned at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to Revolute 1

Let me develop a proper inverse kinematics solution that accounts for both position and orientation:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # The robot has a fixed y offset of 0.093
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 2
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the position in the X-Z plane
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For orientation, we need to consider how joint angles affect the final orientation
    # Joint 1 contributes to rotation around Y-axis
    # Joint 2 contributes to rotation around Z-axis in the rotated frame
    
    # Calculate joint 2 based on the desired orientation
    # We need to account for the contribution of joint 1 to the final orientation
    
    # The orientation around Z after joint 1's contribution
    # For a Y-axis rotation followed by a Z-axis rotation, we need to solve for joint 2
    
    # Convert Euler angles to rotation matrices to handle the composition properly
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)],
            [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([
            [np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-np.sin(angle), 0, np.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([
            [np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle), 0],
            [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    
    # Target orientation as a rotation matrix (XYZ Euler angles)
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Rotation due to joint 1
    R_joint1 = rot_y(joint1)
    
    # The remaining rotation needed by joint 2
    # R_joint2 = R_joint1^-1 @ R_target
    R_joint2 = R_joint1.T @ R_target
    
    # Extract the angle for joint 2 (rotation around Z)
    # For a rotation around Z, we can extract the angle from the rotation matrix
    joint2 = math.atan2(R_joint2[1, 0], R_joint2[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The feedback shows that my approach isn't correctly handling the orientation. Let me revise it:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider the desired orientation
    # The robot's final orientation is a combination of joint 1 and joint 2 rotations
    
    # Create rotation matrices for the target orientation
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)],
            [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([
            [np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-np.sin(angle), 0, np.cos(angle)]
        ])
    
    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([
            [np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle), 0],
            [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    
    # Target orientation as a rotation matrix (XYZ Euler angles)
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Joint 1 contributes a rotation around Y
    R_joint1 = rot_y(joint1)
    
    # The remaining rotation needed from joint 2
    R_remaining = R_joint1.T @ R_target
    
    # Joint 2 is a rotation around Z, so we extract that component
    # For a Z rotation, we look at the [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] elements
    joint2 = math.atan2(R_remaining[1, 0], R_remaining[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

This solution still doesn't fully account for the robot's kinematics. Let me revise it one more time:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    from math import atan2, sin, cos, pi
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, calculate joint 1 based on the position
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis and affects the X-Z position
    joint1 = atan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to determine joint 2 based on the desired orientation
    # We'll use rotation matrices to represent the orientations
    
    # Target orientation as rotation matrix (XYZ Euler angles)
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, cos(rx), -sin(rx)],
        [0, sin(rx), cos(rx)]
    ])
    
    Ry = np.array([
        [cos(ry), 0, sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-sin(ry), 0, cos(ry)]
    ])
    
    Rz = np.array([
        [cos(rz), -sin(rz), 0],
        [sin(rz), cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    R_target = Rz @ Ry @ Rx
    
    # Rotation due to joint 1 (around Y-axis)
    R1 = np.array([
        [cos(joint1), 0, sin(joint1)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-sin(joint1), 0, cos(joint1)]
    ])
    
    # The remaining rotation needed from joint 2
    # R_target = R1 @ R2, so R2 = R1^T @ R_target
    R2 = R1.T @ R_target
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis, so we extract the Z rotation angle
    # For a Z rotation matrix, we can extract the angle using atan2(R[1,0], R[0,0])
    joint2 = atan2(R2[1, 0], R2[0, 0])
    
    # Normalize angles to be within [-pi, pi]
    joint1 = ((joint1 + pi) % (2 * pi)) - pi
    joint2 = ((joint2 + pi) % (2 * pi)) - pi
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

This solution should correctly handle both the position and orientation requirements of the inverse kinematics problem.
