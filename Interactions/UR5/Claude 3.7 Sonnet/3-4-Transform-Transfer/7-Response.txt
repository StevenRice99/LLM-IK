Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution. Let me analyze what's happening in this robot:

1. The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis
2. The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Z-axis
3. The TCP is offset from joint 2 by [0, 0, 0.09465]

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
- Joint 1 rotation affects the orientation of the entire arm
- Joint 2 rotation affects the orientation of the TCP
- The final orientation is a combination of both joint rotations

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, solve for joint1 based on position
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # TCP length
    tcp_length = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    xz_distance = np.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    
    # Adjust joint1 if necessary to ensure the position is reachable
    if abs(xz_distance - tcp_length) > 1e-06:
        scale = tcp_length / max(xz_distance, 1e-10)
        joint1 = np.arctan2(x * scale, z * scale)
    
    # For orientation, joint2 directly controls the Z rotation (rz)
    # But we need to account for the effect of joint1 on the final orientation
    
    # Joint1 contributes to the Y rotation (ry)
    # So the desired rz is directly joint2
    joint2 = rz
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
