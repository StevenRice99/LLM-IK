I see the issue now. My solution was too simplistic and didn't properly account for the relationship between joint angles and the final orientation. Let me develop a more accurate solution.

The key insight from the feedback is that the orientation is affected by both joints in a more complex way than I initially thought. Let me analyze this more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis, which affects the orientation of the entire arm
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis, but this is in the local frame after joint 1's rotation
3. The final orientation is a composition of these rotations

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function with a more accurate approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # First, solve for joint1 based on position
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # TCP length
    tcp_length = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    xz_distance = np.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    
    # Adjust joint1 if necessary to ensure the position is reachable
    if abs(xz_distance - tcp_length) > 1e-06:
        scale = tcp_length / max(xz_distance, 1e-10)
        joint1 = np.arctan2(x * scale, z * scale)
    
    # Create rotation matrix from the target orientation
    target_rot = Rotation.from_euler('xyz', [rx, ry, rz])
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint1
    joint1_rot = Rotation.from_euler('y', joint1)
    
    # To find joint2, we need to determine what rotation is needed after joint1
    # to achieve the target orientation
    # We can compute this by: joint2_rot = joint1_rot.inv() * target_rot
    joint2_rot = joint1_rot.inv() * target_rot
    
    # Extract the rotation around Z-axis, which is what joint2 controls
    joint2_euler = joint2_rot.as_euler('xyz')
    joint2 = joint2_euler[2]  # Z-axis rotation
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I see an issue. The code above uses `scipy.spatial.transform`, which might not be available. Let me rewrite it using only NumPy:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """

    # TCP length
    tcp_length = 0.09465

    xz_distance = np.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)

    # For a 2-DOF robot with joint1 rotating around Y and joint2 around Z,
    # we need to solve for joint2 considering the target orientation
    
    # Create rotation matrices

        c = np.cos(angle)
        s = np.sin(angle)

    # Target rotation matrix (XYZ Euler angles)
    R_target = rot_x(rx) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_z(rz)
    
    # Joint1 rotation matrix
    R_joint1 = rot_y(joint1)
