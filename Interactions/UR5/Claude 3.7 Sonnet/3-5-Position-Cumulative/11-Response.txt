Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant errors. Looking at the correct joint values, I notice a pattern: joint3 is always 0 in the correct solutions. Let me analyze the robot structure again and develop a better solution.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function with a corrected approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1_y = 0.093      # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.09465    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3_y = 0.0823     # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solutions
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # When joint3 is 0, the TCP is offset from joint 3 by l3_y in the Y direction
    # The total Y offset from the base to the TCP when joint2 is 0 is l1_y + l3_y
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the distribution between X and Z
    # The projection of the target onto the XZ plane determines joint1
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # For joint2 (rotation around Z-axis), we need to determine the angle
    # that places the TCP at the target position
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # When joint2 rotates, it changes the position of the TCP
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the target
    
    # The position of joint 3 when joint2 is 0 is (0, l1_y, l2_z)
    # The position of the TCP when joint2 is 0 and joint3 is 0 is (0, l1_y + l3_y, l2_z)
    
    # When joint2 rotates, the TCP moves in a circle around joint2
    # The radius of this circle is sqrt(l2_z^2 + l3_y^2)
    radius = np.sqrt(l2_z**2 + l3_y**2)
    
    # The angle of the TCP relative to joint2 when joint2 is 0
    default_angle = np.arctan2(l3_y, l2_z)
    
    # The target position relative to joint2 (after accounting for joint1 rotation)
    target_y = y - l1_y
    target_r = r_xz
    
    # The angle from joint2 to the target
    target_angle = np.arctan2(target_y, target_r)
    
    # Joint2 needs to rotate to make up the difference between the default angle
    # and the target angle
    joint2 = target_angle - default_angle
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. Let me think about the geometry more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the X and Z coordinates
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis, affecting the distribution between Y and the XZ plane
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis, but is always 0 in the correct solutions

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1_y = 0.093      # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.09465    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3_y = 0.0823     # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solutions
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the distribution between X and Z
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # When joint3 is 0, the TCP is at a fixed position relative to joint3
    # The position of joint3 when joint2 is 0 is (0, l1_y, l2_z)
    # The position of the TCP when joint2 is 0 and joint3 is 0 is (0, l1_y + l3_y, l2_z)
    
    # When joint2 rotates, it rotates the entire arm from joint2 to the TCP
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the target
    
    # The vector from joint2 to the TCP when joint2 and joint3 are 0
    tcp_offset_y = l3_y
    tcp_offset_z = l2_z
    
    # The length of this vector
    tcp_offset_length = np.sqrt(tcp_offset_y**2 + tcp_offset_z**2)
    
    # The angle of this vector relative to the XZ plane
    tcp_offset_angle = np.arctan2(tcp_offset_y, tcp_offset_z)
    
    # The target position relative to joint2
    target_y = y - l1_y
    target_r = r_xz
    
    # The distance from joint2 to the target
    target_distance = np.sqrt(target_y**2 + target_r**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if target_distance > tcp_offset_length:
        # If the target is too far, we can only point in the direction of the target
        target_angle = np.arctan2(target_y, target_r)
        joint2 = target_angle - tcp_offset_angle
    else:
        # If the target is reachable, we need to find the angle that places the TCP at the target
        # Using the law of cosines to find the angle
        cos_angle = (tcp_offset_length**2 + target_r**2 - (target_y**2)) / (2 * tcp_offset_length * target_r)
        cos_angle = np.clip(cos_angle, -1.0, 1.0)
        angle = np.arccos(cos_angle)
        
        # Determine the sign of the angle based on whether the target is above or below joint2
        if target_y >= 0:
            joint2 = angle - tcp_offset_angle
        else:
            joint2 = -angle - tcp_offset_angle
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Let me simplify and focus on the correct approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1_y = 0.093      # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.09465    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3_y = 0.0823     # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solutions
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the distribution between X and Z
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target onto the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # When joint3 is 0, the TCP is offset from joint3 by l3_y in the Y direction
    # and by 0 in the Z direction (in the local frame of joint3)
    
    # When joint2 rotates, it rotates the entire arm from joint2 to the TCP
    # The position of the TCP relative to joint2 is determined by the rotation of joint2
    
    # The vector from joint2 to the TCP when joint2 is 0 and joint3 is 0
    # In the local frame of joint2, this is (0, l3_y, l2_z)
    
    # The target position relative to joint2
    target_y = y - l1_y
    target_r = r_xz
    
    # The angle from the Z-axis to the target
    target_angle = np.arctan2(target_y, target_r)
    
    # The angle from the Z-axis to the TCP when joint2 is 0
    tcp_angle = np.arctan2(l3_y, l2_z)
    
    # Joint2 needs to rotate to make up the difference
    joint2 = target_angle - tcp_angle
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Let me make one final correction to ensure the solution is correct:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    l2_z = 0.09465    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3_y = 0.0823     # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solutions
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the distribution between X and Z

    target_r = r_xz
    
    # The distance from joint2 to the target

    # The angle from the Z-axis to the target
    target_angle = np.arctan2(target_y, target_r)
    
    # Joint2 needs to rotate to make up the difference
    joint2 = target_angle - tcp_angle
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
