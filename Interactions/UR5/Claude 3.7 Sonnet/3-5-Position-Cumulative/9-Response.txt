Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
4. The TCP has an offset from joint 3

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1_y = 0.093      # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.09465    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3_y = 0.0823     # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 1 rotates, it affects the x and z coordinates
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 3, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset in the Y direction from joint 3
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is at (0, l1_y + l3_y, l2_z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 by subtracting the effect of l3_y in the local frame
    # We need to account for joint 2 rotation
    
    # First, solve for joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This affects the distribution of the y coordinate and the r_xz
    
    # The y coordinate at the TCP is influenced by both l1_y and l3_y
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the desired y
    joint2 = np.arctan2(y - l1_y, r_xz)
    
    # Now we need to solve for joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # After joint 2 rotation, the remaining distance to the TCP needs to be covered by joint 3
    
    # Calculate the projection of l3_y onto the XZ plane after joint 2 rotation
    l3_proj_xz = l3_y * np.cos(joint2)
    
    # Calculate the projection of l3_y onto the Y axis after joint 2 rotation
    l3_proj_y = l3_y * np.sin(joint2)
    
    # The actual distance in XZ plane that needs to be covered by joint 3
    r_xz_actual = r_xz - l3_proj_xz
    
    # The actual y coordinate that needs to be reached by joint 3
    y_actual = y - l1_y - l3_proj_y
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle needed to orient the end effector to reach the target
    joint3 = np.arctan2(y_actual, r_xz_actual) - joint2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57, the TCP moves in the X direction
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP moves in the negative X direction
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP stays at the same position

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1_y = 0.093      # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.09465    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3_y = 0.0823     # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # The TCP position when all joints are at 0 is [0, l1_y + l3_y, l2_z] = [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we're working in a new coordinate frame
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis), we need to determine how it affects the position
    # When joint 2 rotates, it changes the distribution between Y and the XZ plane
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to TCP in the YZ plane when joint 2 = 0 is:
    r_yz_default = np.sqrt(l3_y**2 + l2_z**2)
    
    # The angle of the TCP relative to joint 2 when joint 2 = 0:
    phi_default = np.arctan2(l3_y, l2_z)
    
    # To reach the target point, we need to find joint 2 angle:
    # The height from the XZ plane is (y - l1_y)
    joint2 = np.arctan2(y - l1_y, r_xz) - phi_default
    
    # For joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis), we need to ensure the TCP reaches the target
    # Joint 3 doesn't affect the position when all other joints are at 0
    # It only affects orientation, which we don't need to consider for position-only IK
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

I need to reconsider again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the distribution between X and Z
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1_y = 0.093      # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2_z = 0.09465    # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3_y = 0.0823     # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # The effective length in the Y direction when joint 3 is at 0
    y_effective = l1_y + l3_y  # = 0.1753
    
    # The effective length in the Z direction when joint 3 is at 0
    z_effective = l2_z  # = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate the angle needed for joint 2 to reach the target Y coordinate
    # This is the angle between the XZ plane and the line to the target
    target_angle = np.arctan2(y - l1_y, r)
    
    # Calculate the default angle of the TCP when joint 2 and joint 3 are at 0
    default_angle = np.arctan2(l3_y, z_effective)
    
    # Joint 2 needs to rotate to make up the difference
    joint2 = target_angle - default_angle
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis and affects the orientation
    # For position-only IK, we can set it to 0
    joint3 = 0.0
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

After analyzing the forward kinematics tests more carefully, I see that joint 3 does affect the position. Let me revise my solution one more time:

```python

    """

    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the distribution between X and Z
    joint1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The position of the TCP relative to joint 2 is determined by joints 2 and 3
    # We need to solve for both angles to reach the target position
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the target in the YZ plane
    d = np.sqrt((y - l1_y)**2 + r**2)
    
    # The lengths of the two links from joint 2 to TCP
    a = l2_z
    b = l3_y
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between the two links
    cos_gamma = (a**2 + b**2 - d**2) / (2 * a * b)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_gamma = np.clip(cos_gamma, -1.0, 1.0)
    gamma = np.arccos(cos_gamma)
    
    # Joint 3 angle is (pi/2 - gamma)
    joint3 = np.pi/2 - gamma
    
    # Now find joint 2 angle
    # First, find the angle alpha between the first link and the line to the target
    cos_alpha = (a**2 + d**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * d)
    cos_alpha = np.clip(cos_alpha, -1.0, 1.0)
    alpha = np.arccos(cos_alpha)
    
    # The angle between the XZ plane and the line to the target
    beta = np.arctan2(y - l1_y, r)
    
    # Joint 2 angle is (beta - alpha)

    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider the geometry again. Let me provide a final solution:

    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos

I need to make one more correction to account for the specific geometry of this robot:
