Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
4. The TCP has an offset from the last joint

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093  # Y offset of joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Y offset of TCP
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y axis)
    # This determines the X-Z plane orientation
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Adjust target position to account for joint 1 rotation
    # We need to work in the plane defined by joint 1
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)  # Radial distance in X-Z plane
    
    # Solve for joints 2 and 3
    # We need to reach the point (r, py) in the new 2D plane
    
    # For joint 2 (rotation around Z) and joint 3 (rotation around Y)
    # We can use the law of cosines to solve the planar 2-link problem
    
    # First, adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP has an offset in the Y direction after joint 3
    # We need to find where joint 3 should be
    
    # Calculate the direction vector from the target to joint 3
    # Joint 3 is l3 distance away from the target in the direction determined by joint 3
    
    # Since joint 3 rotates around Y, we need to solve the 2D problem in the plane
    # defined by joints 2 and 3
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from joint 1 to the target
    d_squared = r**2 + (py - l1)**2
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from joint 1 to joint 3
    # This is needed to account for the TCP offset
    # We need to solve for joint 3's position first
    
    # Using the law of cosines for the triangle formed by joints 1, 2, and 3
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2), cos_theta3)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to find the angle to the target
    # and adjust for the angle of joint 3
    alpha = math.atan2(py - l1, r)
    beta = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57, the TCP moves primarily in the X direction
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP moves in the negative X direction
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP position doesn't change

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093    # Y offset of joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y axis
    # This affects the X and Z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we need to find theta2 and theta3
    # We'll work in the rotated coordinate frame
    # The distance in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z axis
    # This affects the X and Y coordinates in the rotated frame
    # Joint 3 rotates around Y axis (like joint 1)
    
    # The TCP is at a fixed offset from joint 3
    # We need to work backwards from the target position
    
    # The total Y distance from base to TCP is l1 + l3
    # The total Z distance from base to TCP is l2
    
    # Solve for theta2 (rotation around Z)
    theta2 = math.atan2(l3, l2)
    
    # Solve for theta3 (rotation around Y)
    theta3 = 0  # Based on the tests, joint 3 doesn't affect position
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

I need to revise this solution again. Let me carefully analyze the robot structure and the forward kinematics tests:
