Based on the feedback, I can see that my inverse kinematics solution has significant errors. Looking at the correct joint values from the working solver, I notice a pattern: the third joint (theta3) is consistently 0 in all the correct solutions. This suggests that the robot might be operating in a planar configuration for these test cases.

Let me revise my solution with this insight:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # After applying theta1, we need to find the position in the rotated frame
    # The distance in the xz-plane
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # Based on the feedback, it appears that theta3 is consistently 0
    # This means we're working with a 2-link planar robot in the rotated frame
    theta3 = 0
    
    # The lengths of the links
    l2 = 0.09465  # length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # With theta3 = 0, the effective length of the second link is l2 + l3
    L = l2 + l3
    
    # The target position relative to joint 2
    y_target = py - 0.093
    
    # Calculate theta2 using inverse tangent
    # We need to find the angle that places the end of the combined link at the target
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_target, r)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, this doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider the robot structure more carefully.

Looking at the DETAILS section again:
- Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
- Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
- TCP has an offset from joint 3

And from the feedback, I see that theta3 is consistently 0 in the correct solutions. This means the robot is operating with only joints 1 and 2 for these test cases.

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Set theta3 to 0 as observed in the correct solutions
    theta3 = 0
    
    # With theta3 = 0, we have a simpler kinematic chain
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting the xz-plane
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis, affecting the xy-plane after joint 1's rotation
    
    # First, calculate theta1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # After joint 1's rotation, we need to find the position in the rotated frame
    # The distance in the xz-plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The total length from joint 2 to TCP with theta3 = 0
    l_total = 0.09465 + 0.0823  # joint2-to-joint3 + joint3-to-TCP
    
    # The height of joint 2 from the base
    h_joint2 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate theta2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the target position
    # The target position relative to joint 2 in the rotated frame
    y_rel = py - h_joint2
    
    # Calculate theta2 using inverse tangent
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_rel, r_xz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This still doesn't seem right. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, which affects the orientation in the XZ plane
2. Joint 2 is positioned at [0, 0.093, 0] and rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 is positioned at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 2 and rotates around Y-axis
4. TCP is positioned at [0, 0.0823, 0] relative to joint 3

Let me revise my solution one more time:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Based on the feedback, theta3 is consistently 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # With theta3 = 0, the TCP is effectively at a fixed offset from joint 3
    # The position of joint 3 when theta3 = 0 is:
    # - At height 0.093 (joint 2) + 0 (no vertical offset from joint 2 to joint 3)
    # - At a distance of 0.09465 from joint 2 along the rotated z-axis
    # - The TCP is at a further distance of 0.0823 from joint 3 along the rotated y-axis
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset to find the position of joint 3
    # When theta3 = 0, the TCP offset is along the y-axis in the local frame
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    j3x = px
    j3y = py - 0.0823  # Subtract the TCP y-offset
    j3z = pz
    
    # Now calculate theta1 based on the position of joint 3
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3x, j3z)
    
    # After joint 1's rotation, we're working in a rotated frame
    # The distance from the origin to joint 3 in the xz-plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(j3x**2 + j3z**2)
    
    # The position of joint 3 relative to joint 2
    # Joint 2 is at height 0.093
    j3y_rel = j3y - 0.093
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to joint 3 is 0.09465
    # Calculate theta2 using inverse tangent
    theta2 = math.atan2(j3y_rel, r_xz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This still doesn't match the expected results. Let me try a different approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Based on the feedback, we'll set theta3 = 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # With theta3 = 0, we need to find the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.0823, 0] from joint 3 in the local frame
    # When theta3 = 0, this offset is along the local y-axis
    
    # First, calculate theta1 based on the target position
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # After joint 1's rotation, we're working in a rotated frame
    # The distance in the xz-plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The height of joint 2 from the base
    h_joint2 = 0.093
    
    # The length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l_j2_j3 = 0.09465
    
    # The length from joint 3 to TCP
    l_j3_tcp = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # We need to find the angle that places joint 3 such that the TCP reaches the target
    # The target position relative to joint 2 in the rotated frame
    y_rel = py - h_joint2
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    # When theta3 = 0, the TCP is offset by l_j3_tcp along the y-axis in joint 3's frame
    # This means joint 3 needs to be at:
    j3y = py - l_j3_tcp
    
    # The relative y-position of joint 3 from joint 2
    j3y_rel = j3y - h_joint2
    
    # Calculate theta2 using inverse tangent
    # This is the angle needed to place joint 3 at the correct position
    theta2 = math.atan2(j3y_rel, r_xz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting the correct solution. Let me make one final attempt with a clearer understanding of the robot's structure:

    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the xz-plane after theta1 rotation
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate of the target relative to the base
    y = py
    
    # The y-coordinate of joint 2
    y_j2 = 0.093
    
    # The length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l_j2_j3 = 0.09465
    
    # The length from joint 3 to TCP
    l_j3_tcp = 0.0823
    
    # When theta3 = 0, joint 3 is at a distance l_j2_j3 from joint 2 along the z-axis
    # And the TCP is at a distance l_j3_tcp from joint 3 along the y-axis
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 that would place the TCP at the target

    y_j3 = y - l_j3_tcp

    # The angle from the horizontal to the line connecting joint 2 and joint 3
