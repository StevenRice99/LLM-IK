Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Looking at the correct joint values, I notice a pattern: the third joint (joint3) is always 0 in the correct solutions. This suggests that the robot might be using only the first two joints for positioning.

Let me revise my approach completely based on this insight:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, it appears joint 3 is always 0 in the correct solutions
    # This means we're effectively dealing with a 2-DOF robot for positioning
    theta3 = 0
    
    # First, we need to determine the position of joint 3 when the TCP is at the target
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l3 in the y-direction from joint 3
    
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position to find where joint 3 should be
    # If the TCP is at (x, y, z), and joint 3 is at 0, then joint 3 is at:
    # For a Y-axis rotation of joint 1 and Z-axis rotation of joint 2
    
    # First, calculate the angle of joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we work in the YR plane where R is the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 angle to position joint 3 correctly
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l3 in the local y-direction
    
    # We need to account for this offset when calculating joint 2 angle
    # The position of joint 3 needs to be such that when we add l3 in the local y-direction,
    # we reach the target position
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 in the YR plane
    # We need to solve the triangle formed by joint 2, joint 3, and the projection of the target
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to the projection of the target in the YR plane
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + (y - l1)**2)
    
    # The angle of joint 2 that places joint 3 at the correct position
    # We need to find the angle that places joint 3 at a position such that
    # when we add l3 in the local y-direction, we reach the target
    
    # Calculate the angle of the target relative to joint 2
    target_angle = math.atan2(y - l1, r)
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2 that positions joint 3 correctly
    # This is a bit more complex because we need to account for the l3 offset
    
    # The position of joint 3 is (l2 * sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * cos(theta2))
    # We need to find theta2 such that when we add l3 in the local y-direction after joint 3,
    # we reach the target position
    
    # This means solving the system:
    # x = l2 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) - l3 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1)
    # y = l1 + l2 * cos(theta2) + l3 * cos(theta2)
    # z = l2 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1) + l3 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1)
    
    # Since joint 3 is always 0, we can simplify:
    # x = l2 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1)
    # y = l1 + l2 * cos(theta2) + l3
    # z = l2 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1)
    
    # From the first and third equations:
    # r = l2 * sin(theta2)
    # Therefore: sin(theta2) = r / l2
    
    # From the second equation:
    # y = l1 + l2 * cos(theta2) + l3
    # Therefore: cos(theta2) = (y - l1 - l3) / l2
    
    # Using these two equations, we can find theta2:
    sin_theta2 = r / l2
    cos_theta2 = (y - l1 - l3) / l2
    
    # Calculate theta2 using atan2 to get the correct quadrant
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis

Based on the feedback, it seems joint 3 is always 0 in the correct solutions. Let me revise my approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 is always 0 in the correct solutions
    theta3 = 0
    
    # Since joint 3 is always 0, we need to find the position of joint 3
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l3 in the local y-direction
    
    # We need to work backwards from the TCP position to find where joint 3 should be
    # If joint 3 is at 0, then the TCP is offset by l3 in the local y-direction
    
    # First, calculate the angle of joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we work in the YR plane where R is the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 angle to position joint 3 correctly
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l3 in the local y-direction
    
    # The position of joint 3 in the YR plane needs to be such that
    # when we add l3 in the local y-direction, we reach the target position
    
    # Since joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis, it affects the position in the XY plane
    # The position of joint 3 is (l2 * sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * cos(theta2))
    
    # We need to find theta2 such that when we add l3 in the local y-direction,
    # we reach the target position
    
    # This means solving:
    # r = l2 * sin(theta2)
    # y = l1 + l2 * cos(theta2) + l3
    
    # From the first equation:
    # sin(theta2) = r / l2
    
    # From the second equation:
    # cos(theta2) = (y - l1 - l3) / l2
    
    # Calculate theta2 using atan2 to get the correct quadrant
    sin_theta2 = r / l2
    cos_theta2 = (y - l1 - l3) / l2
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me refine this solution one more time:

```python
import math

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 is always 0 in the correct solutions
    theta3 = 0
    
    # First, calculate the angle of joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we work in the YR plane where R is the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 angle
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l3 in the local y-direction from joint 3
    
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 such that when we add l3 in the local y-direction,

    # From the second equation:

    # Calculate theta2 using atan2 to get the correct quadrant
    sin_theta2 = r / l2
    cos_theta2 = (y - l1 - l3) / l2
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
