I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator based on the forward kinematics results and the provided information. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

From the DETAILS and FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
4. The TCP has an offset from the last joint

Let me work through the solution step by step:

First, I'll analyze the existing solutions:
- Existing solution 1 solves for joint 1 using atan2(px, pz)
- Existing solution 2 solves for joints 1 and 2 using atan2(-x, y) for joint 1

Now, I'll develop the complete solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # First, we need to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP has an offset of [0, 0.0823, 0] in the local frame of joint 3
    # When joint 3 rotates, this offset changes in the global frame
    
    # We need to solve for the position of joint 3 first
    # Let's call the position of joint 3 (j3x, j3y, j3z)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    # From the first existing solution, we know:
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # For joint 2 (Z-axis) and joint 3 (Y-axis), we need to consider the chain
    # The TCP offset is 0.0823 in the y direction of joint 3's local frame
    
    # First, let's compute the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate is straightforward
    # Joint 2 is at y = 0.093
    # Joint 3 is at y = 0.093 (same as joint 2 in y)
    # The TCP has an additional offset in y of 0.0823
    # So the total y offset from joint 2 to TCP is 0.0823
    
    # The position of joint 3 in the y-axis is:
    j3y = py - 0.0823 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # The distance from joint 2 to joint 3 is 0.09465
    # We need to find the angle that places joint 3 such that the TCP reaches the target
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target in the plane perpendicular to joint 2's axis
    # This is the XZ plane rotated by theta1
    r_target = math.sqrt((r_xz - 0.0823 * math.sin(theta1))**2 + (py - 0.093 - 0.0823 * math.cos(theta1))**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    # r_target^2 = l2^2 + l3^2 - 2*l2*l3*cos(pi - theta3)
    # where l2 is the length of link 2 (0.09465) and l3 is the effective length to TCP
    l2 = 0.09465
    l3 = 0.0823
    
    # Rearranging to solve for theta3
    cos_theta3 = (l2**2 + l3**2 - r_target**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.pi - math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now we can find theta2 using the law of sines
    # sin(theta2) / l3 = sin(theta3) / r_target
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    
    # Calculate the angle to the target from joint 2
    angle_to_target = math.atan2(py - 0.093, r_xz)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and the angle to the target
    sin_beta = l3 * sin_theta3 / r_target
    # Clamp to valid range for arcsin
    sin_beta = max(min(sin_beta, 1.0), -1.0)
    beta = math.asin(sin_beta)
    
    theta2 = angle_to_target - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results more carefully:

1. When joint 1 is at 1.57, the TCP moves primarily in the x direction
2. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP moves in the negative x direction
3. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP orientation changes but position remains similar to the zero position

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we need to find the position in the rotated frame
    # The distance in the xz-plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # Joint 2 is at height 0.093
    # Joint 3 is at distance 0.09465 from joint 2
    # TCP is at distance 0.0823 from joint 3
    
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3 to reach the target
    # First, let's determine the target position relative to joint 2
    target_y = py - 0.093  # y distance from joint 2 to target
    target_r = r_xz  # radial distance in xz plane
    
    # The total length of links 3 and TCP
    l3_tcp = math.sqrt(0.09465**2 + 0.0823**2)
    
    # The angle between link 3 and TCP
    alpha = math.atan2(0.0823, 0.09465)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between link 2 and the target
    d = math.sqrt(target_y**2 + target_r**2)  # distance from joint 2 to target
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > l3_tcp:
        # Target is too far, use the maximum extension
        theta2 = math.atan2(target_y, target_r)
        theta3 = 0
    else:
        # Using law of cosines to find the angle between link 3+TCP and the line to target
        cos_beta = (l3_tcp**2 + d**2 - 0**2) / (2 * l3_tcp * d)
        cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1.0), -1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
        beta = math.acos(cos_beta)
        
        # The angle from horizontal to the target
        gamma = math.atan2(target_y, target_r)
        
        # Calculate theta2
        theta2 = gamma - beta
        
        # Calculate theta3 (needs to account for the angle between link 3 and TCP)
        theta3 = math.pi - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me simplify and reconsider:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, we work in the rotated plane
    # The distance in the xz-plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The target position relative to joint 2
    y_rel = py - 0.093
    r_rel = r_xz
    
    # The length of link 3 and TCP combined
    l3 = 0.09465  # length of link 3
    l4 = 0.0823   # length of TCP offset
    
    # Calculate theta3 first
    # Using the law of cosines: r_rel^2 + y_rel^2 = l3^2 + l4^2 + 2*l3*l4*cos(theta3)
    d_squared = r_rel**2 + y_rel**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l3**2 - l4**2) / (2 * l3 * l4)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within valid range
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now calculate theta2
    # We need to find the angle to the target and adjust by the internal angle of the links
    beta = math.atan2(y_rel, r_rel)
    
    # Calculate the internal angle using the law of sines
    sin_gamma = (l4 * math.sin(theta3)) / math.sqrt(d_squared)
    sin_gamma = max(min(sin_gamma, 1.0), -1.0)
    gamma = math.asin(sin_gamma)
    
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me make one final revision based on the robot structure:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the xz-plane
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate relative to joint 2
    y = py - 0.093
    
    # The lengths of the links
    l2 = 0.09465  # length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    d_squared = r**2 + y**2
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within valid range
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle to the target from joint 2
    phi = math.atan2(y, r)
    
    # Then find the angle between link 2 and the line to the target
    k1 = l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3)
    k2 = l3 * math.sin(theta3)
    theta2 = phi - math.atan2(k2, k1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This still doesn't seem right. Let me reconsider the robot structure and the forward kinematics results:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """

    """
    px, py, pz = p

    # The distance in the xz-plane
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The target position relative to joint 2
    y = py - 0.093
    
    # The lengths of the links
    l2 = 0.09465  # length from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from joint 2 to the target
    d_squared = r**2 + y**2
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d_squared - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within valid range
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    beta = math.atan2(y, r)
    alpha = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = beta - alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
