Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis (affects the X and Z coordinates)
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis (affects the X and Y coordinates)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (affects the X and Z coordinates)

Let me develop the inverse kinematics solution step by step:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, we need to solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 1 rotates, it affects the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we can compute the new coordinates in the joint 1 frame
    # We need to find the distance from the origin to the TCP in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate is unchanged by rotation around Y-axis
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    
    # The TCP position after accounting for joint 1 rotation is (r, y, 0)
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis, affecting the position in the XY plane
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the correct height (y)
    
    # First, let's compute the position of the TCP relative to joint 2
    y_rel = y - l1
    
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator in the YR plane (where R is the radial distance in XZ)
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between the links
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + y_rel**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    # (We're assuming all targets are reachable as per instructions)
    
    # Using law of cosines to find the angle between links 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to handle floating point errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # The angle theta3 is measured relative to the extension of link 2
    # For our robot, we need to adjust it to be around the Y-axis
    theta3 = math.pi/2 - theta3
    
    # Now find theta2 using the law of sines
    beta = math.atan2(y_rel, r)
    gamma = math.asin(l3 * math.sin(math.pi - theta3) / d)
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
2. When joint 1 is 1.57 (π/2), the TCP moves to [0.09465, 0.1753, 0.000075]
3. When joint 2 is 1.57 (π/2), the TCP moves to [-0.0823, 0.0931, 0.09465]
4. When joint 3 is 1.57 (π/2), the TCP remains at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    l3 = 0.0823  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, solve for joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # After rotating by theta1, we can compute the distance in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate after accounting for joint 1 is unchanged
    # Now we need to solve for joints 2 and 3
    
    # For joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis) and joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We have a 2-link planar manipulator in the YR plane
    
    # Position of the TCP relative to joint 2
    y_rel = y - l1
    
    # Using geometric approach for the 2-link planar manipulator
    # The end effector position in the YR plane is (r, y_rel)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between links
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + y_rel**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Find the angle of joint 3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to handle floating point errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Adjust theta3 to be measured from the correct reference
    # Based on the forward kinematics tests, joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
    # When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP position doesn't change significantly
    # This suggests we need to adjust our understanding of joint 3
    
    # For joint 2, we need to find the angle that orients the arm toward the target
    alpha = math.atan2(y_rel, r)
    beta = math.acos((l2**2 + d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to reconsider this again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

    # Joint 3 should be at (r_rel, y_rel - l3) when joint 3 angle is 0
    # or at (r_rel - l3, y_rel) when joint 3 angle is π/2
    
    # Based on the forward kinematics tests, when joint 3 is at 1.57,
    # the TCP position doesn't change significantly in the x and z directions
    # This suggests joint 3 might primarily affect orientation, not position
    
    # Let's simplify and assume joint 3 doesn't significantly affect the TCP position
