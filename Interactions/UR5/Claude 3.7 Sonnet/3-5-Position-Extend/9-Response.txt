Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z coordinates)
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis (affects X and Y coordinates)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z coordinates)

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.093  # Y offset of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of link 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Y offset of TCP
    
    # First, we need to find the position of the wrist (joint 3)
    # The TCP has an offset from joint 3, and we need to account for joint 3's rotation
    
    # For joint 1, we need to consider the X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # For joint 3, we can use the distance in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # The Y coordinate is directly affected by joint 2 and the TCP offset
    # We need to solve for joint 2 angle that gives us the correct Y position
    # py = l1 + l3*cos(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = (py - l1) / l3
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # For joint 3, we need to consider how it affects the X-Z plane distance
    # r_xz = l2*sin(theta3) + l3*sin(theta2+theta3)
    sin_theta3 = (r_xz - l3*math.sin(theta2)) / l2
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arcsin
    sin_theta3 = max(min(sin_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.asin(sin_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. The forward kinematics tests show that the relationships are more complex than my initial analysis. Let me revise:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.093  # Y offset of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of link 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Y offset of TCP
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting X and Z
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
    # When joint 2 is at 0, the TCP is at y = l1 + l3
    # When joint 2 is at π/2, the TCP's y position is affected by l2
    # py = l1 + l3*cos(theta2)
    y_offset = py - l1
    theta2 = math.atan2(r_xz - l2, y_offset)
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
    # This affects the final position in the X-Z plane
    theta3 = -theta1  # This is a simplification, needs refinement
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not capturing the full kinematics correctly. Let me revise one more time with a more systematic approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Link dimensions from the DETAILS table
    l1 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of link 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Rotate the target point back by -theta1 to simplify the problem
    # This puts the target in a plane where we can solve joints 2 and 3
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the Y-Z plane (where Z is now the rotated distance r)
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3 to reach the point (py, r)
    
    # For joint 2 (rotation around Z), we need to find the angle that positions
    # the end effector at the correct Y coordinate
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, py - l1)
    
    # For joint 3 (rotation around Y), we need to ensure the end effector
    # reaches the correct position after joint 2's rotation
    theta3 = 0  # This is a placeholder, needs to be calculated
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting the correct solution. Let me take a step back and analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of link 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the X and Z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # Joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This affects the distribution between Y and the X-Z plane
    # When theta2 = 0, TCP is at (0, l1+l3, l2)
    # When theta2 = π/2, TCP is at (l3, l1, l2)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the distribution between X and Z in the X-Z plane
    
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3 simultaneously
    # Let's use the fact that the TCP's Y position is determined by theta2
    # py = l1 + l3*cos(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = (py - l1) / l3
    # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1] for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Now we can solve for theta3 using the X-Z plane distance
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    # r = l3*sin(theta2)
    # We need to adjust theta3 to ensure we reach the correct X-Z distance
    theta3 = 0  # This is still a placeholder
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still struggling with the exact relationship. Let me complete the solution with a more systematic approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of link 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP
    
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # For joints 2 and 3, we need to solve the 2D problem in the plane defined by theta1
    # The TCP position is determined by the combination of joints 2 and 3
    
    # From the forward kinematics tests, we can see that:
    # - When all joints are 0, TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
    # - When joint 2 is π/2, TCP's X coordinate becomes negative
    
    # Let's solve for theta2 first using the Y coordinate
    theta2 = math.atan2(r - l2, py - l1)
    
    # Now solve for theta3 to ensure we reach the correct position in the X-Z plane
    theta3 = theta1  # This ensures the TCP points in the right direction
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me make one final attempt with a clearer understanding of the kinematics:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Link dimensions
    l1 = 0.093    # Y offset of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Z offset of link 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Y offset of TCP
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider how it affects the Y coordinate
    # and the projection in the X-Z plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, py - l1)
    
    # For joint 3, we need to ensure the end effector reaches the correct position
    # Joint 3 needs to compensate for the rotation of joint 1
    theta3 = -theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```
