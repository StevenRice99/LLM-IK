I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the correct joint values from the feedback, I notice that joint3 is consistently set to 0 in the working solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully and revise my approach.

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function with the correct solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solution
    # This means the robot is using only joint1 and joint2 for positioning
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # With joint3 = 0, the end effector is at a fixed distance from joint2
    # This distance is the combined length of link2 and link3
    # But we need to account for their perpendicular arrangement
    total_reach = np.sqrt(l2**2 + l3**2)
    
    # The angle between link2 and the total reach vector
    phi = np.arctan2(l3, l2)
    
    # Distance from origin to target in XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the required angle for joint2
    # We need to find the angle that places the end effector at the target
    y_rel = y - l1  # y-coordinate relative to joint2
    
    # Calculate the angle needed to reach the target
    # This is the angle between the horizontal plane and the line to the target
    target_angle = np.arctan2(y_rel, r_xz)
    
    # Joint2 angle is the target angle plus the fixed offset phi
    theta2 = target_angle + phi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. The feedback shows that joint3 is always 0, but my calculation for theta2 isn't correct. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solution
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # With joint3 = 0, we need to calculate the position of joint2
    # and determine the angle needed to reach the target
    
    # Distance from origin to target in XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate relative to joint2
    y_rel = y - l1
    
    # When joint3 is 0, the TCP is offset from joint3 by l3 in the y-direction
    # and by l2 in the z-direction (relative to joint2's frame)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the target position
    
    # The angle between the horizontal and the line from joint2 to the target
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_rel, r_xz)
    
    # The angle between the line from joint2 to joint3 and the line from joint3 to TCP
    beta = np.arctan2(l3, l2)
    
    # Theta2 is the difference between these angles
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting it right. Let me analyze the robot structure one more time:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis (affects x and z)
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis (affects the projection in the XZ plane and y)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (but is set to 0 in the correct solution)

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solution
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # When joint3 is 0, we need to account for the fixed geometry of the robot
    # The TCP is offset from joint2 by a fixed vector when joint3 = 0
    
    # Calculate the position of joint3 relative to joint2 when the robot needs to reach p
    # We need to work backwards from the target position
    
    # First, calculate the unit vector in the direction from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    if r_xz > 0:
        ux = x / r_xz
        uz = z / r_xz
    else:
        ux = 0
        uz = 1  # Default direction if target is directly above/below the origin
    
    # The TCP is offset from joint3 by l3 in the y-direction when joint3 = 0
    # So joint3's position would be:
    j3_y = y - l3
    
    # The height of joint3 above joint2 is fixed at l2 when joint3 = 0
    # So the position of joint3 relative to joint2 in the robot's frame would be:
    j3_x_rel = 0
    j3_y_rel = j3_y - l1
    j3_z_rel = l2
    
    # Calculate the angle needed for joint2 to place joint3 at this position
    # This is the angle between the vertical (z-axis) and the line from joint2 to joint3
    theta2 = np.arctan2(j3_y_rel, j3_z_rel)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting it right. Let me try a different approach by analyzing the robot's geometry more carefully:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint3 is always 0 in the correct solution
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # With joint3 = 0, the TCP is at a fixed offset from joint2
    # We need to find the position where joint2 should be to reach the target
    
    # First, rotate the target point back by -theta1 around the Y-axis
    # This gives us the target in the YZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Now we need to solve the 2D problem in the YZ plane
    # When joint3 = 0, the TCP is offset from joint2 by:
    # - l2 in the Z direction
    # - l3 in the Y direction
    
    # Calculate the position of joint2 needed to reach the target
    j2_y = y - l3
    j2_z = z - l2 * np.cos(theta1)
    j2_x = x - l2 * np.sin(theta1)
    
    # The angle for joint2 is the angle needed to rotate from the initial position
    # to place joint2 at the calculated position
    theta2 = np.arctan2(j2_y - l1, np.sqrt(j2_x**2 + j2_z**2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting the correct solution. Let me try one more approach with a clearer understanding of the robot's geometry:

    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # Calculate theta1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # When joint3 = 0, we have a fixed configuration for the last two links
    # The TCP is offset from joint2 by a vector that depends on theta2
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the position of the TCP relative to joint2 when joint3 = 0
    # This is a function of theta2
    # We need to find the value of theta2 that places the TCP at the target
    
    # The y-coordinate of the target relative to joint2
    y_rel = y - l1
    
    # When joint3 = 0, the TCP is at a fixed offset from joint2
    # in a direction determined by theta2
    
    # The TCP is offset from joint2 by:
    # - l2 in the direction determined by theta2
    # - l3 perpendicular to that direction
    
    # We need to find theta2 such that:
    # y_rel = l2 * sin(theta2) + l3 * cos(theta2)
    # r_xz = l2 * cos(theta2) - l3 * sin(theta2)
    
    # This gives us:
    # y_rel * cos(theta2) - r_xz * sin(theta2) = l2
    # y_rel * sin(theta2) + r_xz * cos(theta2) = l3
    
    # Solving for theta2:
