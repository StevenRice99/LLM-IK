I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the correct joint values from the feedback, I notice that joint 3 is consistently set to 0 in the working solution, which I didn't account for in my approach. Let me revise my solution based on this insight.

Looking at the robot structure more carefully:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
4. The TCP has a fixed offset from joint 3

Let me develop a new solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (Y direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (Z direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (Y direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, it appears joint 3 is consistently set to 0
    # This means we're only using joints 1 and 2 for positioning
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # With joint 3 = 0, the TCP is offset from joint 2 by:
    # - l2 in the Z direction
    # - l3 in the Y direction
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 2 given the target TCP position
    # When all joints are 0, the TCP is at [0, l1+l3, l2]
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y, so it affects X and Z
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z, so it affects X and Y
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 2
    # This requires working backwards from the target position
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the X-Z plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane from the origin to the target
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The position of joint 2 in the Y direction is fixed at l1
    # The position of joint 2 in the X-Z plane depends on joint 1
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 angle to position the TCP correctly
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis, affecting the position in the X-Y plane
    
    # Calculate the required position of joint 3
    # Joint 3 is l2 away from joint 2 in the direction determined by joint 1
    j3_x = l2 * np.sin(theta1)
    j3_z = l2 * np.cos(theta1)
    
    # The TCP is l3 away from joint 3 in the Y direction when joint 3 = 0
    # So the position of joint 3 should be:
    j3_y = y - l3
    
    # Now we need to find the angle of joint 2 to position joint 3 correctly
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z, so it affects the position in the X-Y plane
    
    # Calculate the angle from joint 2 to joint 3 in the X-Y plane
    # The X position of joint 2 is determined by joint 1
    j2_x = 0  # When joint 2 = 0
    j2_y = l1
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2
    dx = j3_x - j2_x
    dy = j3_y - j2_y
    
    # The angle of joint 2 is the angle in the X-Y plane
    theta2 = np.arctan2(dx, dy)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I think I'm still not fully understanding the robot's kinematics. Let me revise again:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (Y direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (Z direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (Y direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 is consistently set to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # With joint 3 = 0, we need to solve for joint 1 and joint 2
    
    # First, determine the position of joint 2
    j2_y = l1
    j2_x = 0
    j2_z = 0
    
    # When joint 3 = 0, the TCP is offset from joint 2 by:
    # - l2 in the Z direction
    # - l3 in the Y direction
    # But this offset is affected by joint 1 and joint 2 rotations
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting X and Z
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis, affecting X and Y
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # After joint 1 rotation, the offset from joint 2 to TCP is:
    # - l2*cos(theta1) in Z direction
    # - l2*sin(theta1) in X direction
    # - l3 in Y direction (not affected by joint 1)
    
    # Calculate the required position of joint 2 to reach the target
    # The target is at [x, y, z]
    # Joint 2 needs to be positioned so that after applying the offset,
    # we reach the target
    
    # Calculate the vector from joint 2 to target
    vec_j2_to_target = [
        x,                  # X coordinate of target
        y - j2_y,           # Y coordinate of target - Y coordinate of joint 2
        z                   # Z coordinate of target
    ]
    
    # Calculate the length of this vector
    length = np.sqrt(vec_j2_to_target[0]**2 + vec_j2_to_target[1]**2 + vec_j2_to_target[2]**2)
    
    # The angle of joint 2 is determined by the position in the X-Y plane
    # after accounting for joint 1 rotation
    
    # Calculate the angle in the X-Y plane
    theta2 = np.arctan2(x / np.cos(theta1) - l2 * np.tan(theta1), y - l1 - l3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not getting it right. Let me try a different approach:

    # Based on the feedback, joint 3 is consistently set to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    # When joint 3 = 0, the end effector is offset from joint 2 by:

    # Calculate the position of joint 2 that would place the end effector at the target
    # First, account for the offset in the Y direction
    j2_y = y - l3
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the required distance in the X-Z plane from joint 1 to joint 2

    # When joint 2 = 0, joint 3 is l2 away from joint 2 in the Z direction
    # When joint 2 â‰  0, this offset is rotated in the X-Z plane
    
    # Calculate the angle of joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This is the angle between the Y axis and the line from joint 2 to the target
    # in the Y-(X-Z) plane
    
    # The position of joint 2 in the Y direction is l1
    # The difference in Y between joint 2 and the target is:
