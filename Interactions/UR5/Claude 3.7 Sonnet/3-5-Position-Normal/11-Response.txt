I see the issue with my solution. Looking at the correct joint values from the feedback, I notice that joint3 is consistently 0 in all the correct solutions, which I didn't account for in my approach. Let me revise my solution based on this insight.

Let me analyze the robot structure again:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis

The feedback shows that a working solution keeps joint3 at 0, which means the robot is using only 2 joints to reach the targets. This makes sense given the robot's structure - with joint3 at 0, the TCP extends in the Y direction from joint3.

Here's my revised solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (Y direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (Z direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (Y direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, we'll set joint3 to 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # With joint3 = 0, the TCP is offset from joint3 by l3 in the Y direction
    # We need to work backwards to find where joint3 should be
    
    # First, determine joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the X and Z coordinates
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # With joint3 = 0, we need to position joint3 such that:
    # 1. It's at the correct height (y - l3)
    # 2. It's at the correct distance in the X-Z plane
    
    # Target position for joint3
    j3_y = y - l3
    j3_xz = r_xz
    
    # Now we need to find joint2 angle to position joint3 correctly
    # Joint2 rotates around Z-axis, which affects the position of joint3
    
    # When joint2 = 0, joint3 is at (0, l1, l2) relative to the base
    # We need to rotate joint2 to move joint3 to (j3_xz, j3_y, 0) in the rotated frame
    
    # Calculate the angle needed
    # The angle is between the Z-axis and the line from joint2 to joint3
    theta2 = np.arctan2(j3_xz, j3_y - l1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this. If joint3 is always 0, then the TCP is always offset from joint3 by l3 in the Y direction in the local frame. But I need to account for the rotation of joint2.

Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (Y direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (Z direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (Y direction)
    
    # Based on the feedback, we'll set joint3 to 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # First, determine joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # With joint3 = 0, the TCP is offset from joint3 by l3 in the Y direction in the local frame
    # When joint2 rotates, this offset rotates in the global frame
    
    # We need to find joint2 angle such that the TCP reaches the target
    # This is a geometric problem where we have:
    # - Joint2 at (0, l1, 0)
    # - Joint3 at a distance l2 from Joint2 (direction depends on joint2 angle)
    # - TCP at a distance l3 from Joint3 (direction depends on joint2 angle)
    
    # We can solve this by finding the angle that positions the TCP at the target
    
    # The position of the TCP relative to joint2 is:
    # x_tcp = l2 * sin(theta2) + l3 * cos(theta2)
    # y_tcp = l2 * cos(theta2) - l3 * sin(theta2)
    
    # We want:
    # x_tcp = r_xz
    # y_tcp = y - l1
    
    # This gives us:
    # r_xz = l2 * sin(theta2) + l3 * cos(theta2)
    # y - l1 = l2 * cos(theta2) - l3 * sin(theta2)
    
    # Rearranging:
    # r_xz = l2 * sin(theta2) + l3 * cos(theta2)
    # y - l1 = l2 * cos(theta2) - l3 * sin(theta2)
    
    # Multiply the first equation by cos(theta2) and the second by sin(theta2):
    # r_xz * cos(theta2) = l2 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta2) + l3 * cos^2(theta2)
    # (y - l1) * sin(theta2) = l2 * cos(theta2) * sin(theta2) - l3 * sin^2(theta2)
    
    # Add these equations:
    # r_xz * cos(theta2) + (y - l1) * sin(theta2) = l2 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta2) + l3 * cos^2(theta2) + l2 * cos(theta2) * sin(theta2) - l3 * sin^2(theta2)
    # r_xz * cos(theta2) + (y - l1) * sin(theta2) = 2 * l2 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta2) + l3 * (cos^2(theta2) - sin^2(theta2))
    # r_xz * cos(theta2) + (y - l1) * sin(theta2) = l2 * sin(2*theta2) + l3 * cos(2*theta2)
    
    # This is getting complex. Let me try a different approach.
    
    # Let's use the fact that the TCP is at a fixed distance from joint2:
    # distance = sqrt(l2^2 + l3^2)
    
    # And the angle between the line from joint2 to TCP and the Z-axis is:
    # alpha = atan2(l3, l2)
    
    # So the position of the TCP relative to joint2 is:
    # x_tcp = distance * sin(theta2 - alpha)
    # y_tcp = distance * cos(theta2 - alpha)
    
    # We want:
    # x_tcp = r_xz
    # y_tcp = y - l1
    
    # This gives us:
    # r_xz = distance * sin(theta2 - alpha)
    # y - l1 = distance * cos(theta2 - alpha)
    
    # Therefore:
    # theta2 - alpha = atan2(r_xz, y - l1)
    # theta2 = atan2(r_xz, y - l1) + alpha
    
    distance = np.sqrt(l2**2 + l3**2)
    alpha = np.arctan2(l3, l2)
    
    theta2 = np.arctan2(r_xz, y - l1) + alpha
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider the geometry again. Let me think about this more carefully:

    # Based on the feedback, we'll set joint3 to 0
    theta3 = 0
    
    # First, determine joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # With joint3 = 0, we need to find joint2 angle

    # Square and add the equations:

    # r_xz^2 + (y - l1)^2 = l2^2 + l3^2
    
    # This is a check that the target is at the correct distance from joint2
    # Let's use the original equations to solve for theta2
    
    # r_xz = l2 * sin(theta2) + l3 * cos(theta2)
    # y - l1 = l2 * cos(theta2) - l3 * sin(theta2)
    
    # Multiply the first by cos(theta2) and the second by sin(theta2):

    # (y - l1) * sin(theta2) = l2 * cos(theta2) * sin(theta2) - l3 * sin^2(theta2)
    
    # Subtract the second from the first:

    # r_xz * cos(theta2) - (y - l1) * sin(theta2) = l3
    
    # Similarly, multiply the first by sin(theta2) and the second by cos(theta2):
