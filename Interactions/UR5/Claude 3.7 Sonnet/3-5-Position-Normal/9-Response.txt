I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and movement patterns.

Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z coordinates)
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis (affects X and Y coordinates)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z coordinates)

Let me derive the closed-form solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, we need to find joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 2 and 3 are zero, the TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
    # Joint 1 rotates the arm in the X-Z plane
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # If the target is directly above/below the base, we can set joint 1 to 0
    if abs(r_xz) < 1e-10:
        theta1 = 0
    else:
        # Otherwise, calculate the angle
        theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 and 3 angles
    # We'll work in the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target in the Y direction
    y_from_j2 = y - l1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target in the X-Z plane
    # We need to account for joint 1 rotation
    xz_from_j2 = r_xz
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the plane defined by joint 1
    # We need to find joint 2 and 3 angles to reach the target
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = np.sqrt(y_from_j2**2 + xz_from_j2**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    # (We're told all targets will be reachable, but this is a sanity check)
    max_reach = l2 + l3
    if r > max_reach:
        # Target is too far, but we're told all targets are reachable
        # So this shouldn't happen
        pass
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between the links
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to handle floating point errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Joint 3 angle (internal angle between links)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to find the angle to the target and the angle in the linkage
    gamma = np.arctan2(y_from_j2, xz_from_j2)
    
    # Use the law of sines to find the angle in the linkage
    sin_alpha = l3 * np.sin(theta3) / r
    # Clamp to handle floating point errors
    sin_alpha = np.clip(sin_alpha, -1.0, 1.0)
    alpha = np.arcsin(sin_alpha)
    
    # Joint 2 angle
    theta2 = gamma - alpha
    
    # Adjust joint 3 angle to be relative to joint 2
    theta3 = np.pi - theta3
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis

Let me revise the solution:

```python

    # This affects the X and Z coordinates
    if abs(x) < 1e-10 and abs(z) < 1e-10:
        # Target is along the Y-axis, can set joint 1 to 0
        theta1 = 0
    else:

    # We now have a 2D problem in the Y-XZ plane
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z, and Joint 3 rotates around Y
    
    # For joint 3, we need to determine how much it needs to rotate to align with the target
    # When joint 3 is at 0, the TCP is offset by l3 in the Y direction from joint 3
    
    # For joint 2, we need to determine how much it needs to rotate to position joint 3
    # such that the TCP can reach the target
    
    # This is a 2-link planar manipulator problem in the Y-XZ plane
    # Link 1 length is l2 (Z direction when joint 2 is 0)

I need to reconsider this solution again. Let me analyze the robot structure more carefully based on the forward kinematics tests:
