I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator based on the forward kinematics tests we've performed. Let me analyze the robot structure and derive the equations step by step.

From the tests and the provided details, I can see that:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis
- The TCP has a fixed orientation offset

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 1 rotates, it affects the x and z coordinates
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Adjust for the offset of joint 2 from the base
    y_adj = y - l1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target in the YZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_adj**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Ensure the value is within valid range for arccos
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of sines and arctan
    beta = np.arctan2(y_adj, r_xz)
    gamma = np.arcsin((l3 * np.sin(theta3)) / r)
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
2. When joint 1 is at 1.57, the TCP's x and z positions change
3. When joint 2 is at 1.57, the TCP's x and y positions change
4. When joint 3 is at 1.57, the TCP's orientation changes but not its position significantly

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target point onto the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist (joint 3) by subtracting the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset is affected by joint 3 rotation, but we don't know that yet
    # We need to solve this iteratively or use a different approach
    
    # For a simplified approach, we can use the fact that joint 3 mainly affects orientation
    # and solve for joint 2 and 3 based on the projected distance and height
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This affects the projection of the arm in the XZ plane and the height
    y_offset = y - l1
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y_offset, r)
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This mainly affects the orientation of the TCP
    # We can calculate it based on the remaining distance to reach the target
    projected_length = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_offset**2)
    cos_theta3 = (projected_length**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I'm still not confident in this solution. Let me revise it one more time based on a more careful analysis of the robot's kinematics:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # For joint 2 and 3, we need to solve the planar problem in the plane defined by
    # the distance from the origin in the XZ plane and the Y axis
    
    # The y-coordinate of the target relative to joint 2
    y_rel = y - l1
    
    # The effective length of links 2 and 3 in the plane
    # We need to solve for theta2 and theta3 to reach the point (r_xz, y_rel)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_rel**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to target
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle between the line from joint 2 to the target and the horizontal
    phi = np.arctan2(y_rel, r_xz)
    
    # Then, find the angle between the line from joint 2 to joint 3 and the line from joint 2 to the target
    psi = np.arcsin(l3 * np.sin(theta3) / d)
    
    # Theta2 is the difference between these angles
    theta2 = phi - psi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution still doesn't seem right. Let me make one final correction:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Robot dimensions from the details
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2 (y-direction)
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate of the target relative to joint 2
    y_rel = y - l1
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta3
    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_rel**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to target
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # First, find the angle between the line from joint 2 to the target and the horizontal
    phi = np.arctan2(y_rel, r_xz)
    
    # Then, find the angle between the line from joint 2 to joint 3 and the line from joint 2 to the target
    beta = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))
    
    # Theta2 is the sum of these angles
    theta2 = phi - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

After careful analysis, I believe there's still an issue with the calculation. Let me provide the final corrected solution:

```python

    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 (z-direction)
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP (y-direction)
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting x and z
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Distance in the XZ plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The y-coordinate of the target relative to joint 2

    d = np.sqrt(r_xz**2 + y_rel**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to target

    alpha = np.arctan2(y_rel, r_xz)
    beta = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))
    
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
