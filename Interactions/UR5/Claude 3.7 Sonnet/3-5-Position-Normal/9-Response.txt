I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and movement patterns.

Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z coordinates)
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis (affects X and Y coordinates)
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis (affects X and Z coordinates)

Let me derive the closed-form solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, we need to find joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 2 and 3 are zero, the TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
    # Joint 1 rotates the arm in the X-Z plane
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target point onto the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # If the target is directly above/below the base, we can set joint 1 to any value
    # (singularity case)
    if np.isclose(r_xz, 0):
        theta1 = 0
    else:
        theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Now we need to find joint 2 and 3 angles
    # We'll work in the plane defined by joint 1 rotation
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the target in the Y direction
    y_from_base = y - l1
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 1 to the target in the X-Z plane
    # after accounting for joint 1 rotation
    x_from_base = r_xz
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target
    r = np.sqrt(x_from_base**2 + y_from_base**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Now find joint 2 angle using the law of sines
    # Calculate the angle between the l2 link and the line to the target
    beta = np.arctan2(y_from_base, x_from_base)
    
    # Calculate the angle between l2 and the line connecting joint 2 to the target
    gamma = np.arccos((l2**2 + r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * r))
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
    theta2 = beta - gamma
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results more carefully:

1. When joint 1 = 1.57 (90 degrees around Y), the TCP moves primarily in the X direction
2. When joint 2 = 1.57 (90 degrees around Z), the TCP moves in the X-Y plane
3. When joint 3 = 1.57 (90 degrees around Y), the TCP orientation changes but position is affected

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    l1 = 0.093  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, determine joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This affects the position in the X-Z plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target in the plane after joint 1 rotation
    # This is the distance in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The remaining problem is to solve for joint 2 and 3 in the plane
    # defined by the joint 1 rotation
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target in Y direction
    dy = y - l1
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target in X-Z plane
    dx = r_xz
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target
    r = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find joint 3 angle
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    # Clamp to valid range to handle numerical errors
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    
    # Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find angle between l2 and the line to the target
    alpha = np.arctan2(dy, dx)
    
    # Find angle between l2 and the line from joint 2 to joint 3
    beta = np.arccos((l2**2 + r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * r))
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Let me refine this solution one more time to ensure it's correct:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """

    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the projection of the target in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # The remaining problem is to solve for joint 2 and 3 in the plane
    # defined by the joint 1 rotation

    dx = r_xz
    
    # Distance from joint 2 to target

    # Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Find angle between horizontal and the line to the target
    alpha = np.arctan2(dy, dx)
    
    # Find angle between l2 and the line from joint 2 to joint 3
    beta = np.arccos((l2**2 + r**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * r))
    
    # Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
