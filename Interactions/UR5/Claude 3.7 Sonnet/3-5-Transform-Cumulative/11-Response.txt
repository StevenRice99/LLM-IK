Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant issues. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a better inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the correct joint values and comparing them with my solution, I notice several key issues:
1. My solution isn't handling the orientation requirements correctly
2. Joint 2 and joint 3 calculations are particularly problematic
3. I need to properly account for the robot's kinematic structure

Let me create a new solution based on the provided examples:
