Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around Y-axis
4. The TCP has an orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.57] (π/2 around Z-axis)

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python

I'm still not satisfied with this solution. Let me simplify and correct it:
