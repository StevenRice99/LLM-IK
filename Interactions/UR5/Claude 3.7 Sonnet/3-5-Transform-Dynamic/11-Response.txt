Thank you for the feedback. I see that my solution has significant errors. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback and develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.

Looking at the feedback data, I need to better understand the relationship between the target position/orientation and the joint angles. Let me develop a new solution:

```python

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    # First, we need to find the position of the wrist (joint 3) by removing the TCP offset

    # Calculate the distance from the origin to joint 3 in the X-Z plane
    r_xz = math.sqrt(j3_x**2 + j3_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the height of joint 3 relative to joint 2

    # From the feedback examples, it appears that:
