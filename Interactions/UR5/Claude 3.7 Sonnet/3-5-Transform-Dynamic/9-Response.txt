Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis
3. Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis
4. The TCP has an offset and a fixed orientation relative to joint 3

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Extract target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Robot dimensions
    L1 = 0.093    # Y offset from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.09465  # Z offset from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.0823   # Y offset from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # The TCP has a fixed orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.570796325] relative to joint 3
    # We need to account for this when calculating joint angles
    
    # First, we need to find the position of joint 3 by subtracting the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset is L3 in the Y direction when all joints are at 0
    # But this offset rotates with joint 3 (Y-axis) and joint 2 (Z-axis)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 angle (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This affects the X-Y position
    theta2 = math.atan2(-px, py - L1)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 by removing the effect of the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset is rotated by joint 2 and joint 3
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    
    # The orientation of the end effector is determined by all three joints
    # Joint 1 and joint 3 rotate around Y-axis, joint 2 rotates around Z-axis
    # The fixed orientation offset of the TCP is [0, 0, π/2]
    
    # For a Y-axis rotation (joint 1 and 3), the rotation affects rx and rz
    # For a Z-axis rotation (joint 2), the rotation affects rx and ry
    
    # Calculate joint 3 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is derived from the orientation requirements
    theta3 = ry - rx * sin_theta2
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is derived from the orientation and the other joint angles
    theta1 = rx * cos_theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. Let me analyze the forward kinematics tests more carefully:

1. When joint 1 (Y-axis) is set to 0.5, we see changes in X and Z coordinates of the TCP
2. When joint 2 (Z-axis) is set to 0.5, we see changes in X and Y coordinates of the TCP
3. When joint 3 (Y-axis) is set to 0.5, we see changes in the orientation of the TCP

Let me revise the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    # The TCP has a fixed orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.570796325] relative to joint 3
    # We need to account for this when calculating joint angles

    # Joint 1 rotation around Y-axis affects the position
    # We need to calculate what joint 1 angle would place the TCP at the desired position
    # given the angles of joints 2 and 3

    # which is rotated by joint 2 and joint 3
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta3 = math.cos(theta3)

    offset_z = 0

    j3_y = py - offset_y
    j3_z = pz - offset_z
    
    # Now calculate joint 1 angle to position joint 3 correctly
    # Joint 1 rotates around Y-axis, affecting X and Z coordinates
    theta1 = math.atan2(j3_x, j3_z - L2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to refine this solution further. Let me analyze the robot structure one more time:

    """

    v_x = j3_x - j2_x
    v_z = j3_z - j2_z
    
    # Calculate joint 1 angle
    theta1 = math.atan2(v_x, v_z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution still doesn't fully account for all the transformations. Let me provide a more accurate solution:
