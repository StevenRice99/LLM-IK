Thank you for providing the forward kinematics test results. This helps me understand how the robot's joints affect the end effector position and orientation. Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator.

Let me analyze the robot structure based on the details provided:
- We have 3 revolute joints
- Joint 1 rotates around Y axis
- Joint 2 rotates around Z axis
- Joint 3 rotates around Y axis
- The TCP has an additional fixed orientation offset

I'll now complete the inverse kinematics function by extending the existing 2-joint solution to include the third joint:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    # Target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Account for the TCP offset
    # TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0] with orientation [0, 0, 1.570796325] relative to link 3
    # We need to find the position and orientation of link 3 that would place the TCP at the target
    
    # Create rotation matrix for the target orientation
    def euler_to_rotation_matrix(euler_angles):
        x, y, z = euler_angles
        Rx = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, math.cos(x), -math.sin(x)], [0, math.sin(x), math.cos(x)]])
        Ry = np.array([[math.cos(y), 0, math.sin(y)], [0, 1, 0], [-math.sin(y), 0, math.cos(y)]])
        Rz = np.array([[math.cos(z), -math.sin(z), 0], [math.sin(z), math.cos(z), 0], [0, 0, 1]])
        return np.matmul(np.matmul(Rz, Ry), Rx)
    
    # Target rotation matrix
    R_target = euler_to_rotation_matrix([rx, ry, rz])
    
    # TCP offset rotation matrix (fixed rotation around Z by 1.570796325)
    R_tcp_offset = euler_to_rotation_matrix([0, 0, 1.570796325])
    
    # Calculate the rotation matrix for link 3
    # R_target = R_link3 * R_tcp_offset
    # Therefore: R_link3 = R_target * R_tcp_offset^-1
    R_tcp_offset_inv = np.transpose(R_tcp_offset)  # Inverse of rotation matrix is its transpose
    R_link3 = np.matmul(R_target, R_tcp_offset_inv)
    
    # Calculate the position of link 3
    # The TCP position is the link 3 position plus the TCP offset transformed by link 3's orientation
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0.0823, 0])
    tcp_offset_world = np.matmul(R_link3, tcp_offset)
    link3_pos = np.array([px, py, pz]) - tcp_offset_world
    
    # Now we can solve for the joint angles
    # Joint 1 (rotation around Y axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(link3_pos[0], link3_pos[2])
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 1
    joint1_matrix = np.array([
        [math.cos(joint1), 0, math.sin(joint1)], 
        [0, 1, 0], 
        [-math.sin(joint1), 0, math.cos(joint1)]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the rotation matrix for joints 2 and 3 combined
    joint1_inv = np.transpose(joint1_matrix)
    R_23 = np.matmul(joint1_inv, R_link3)
    
    # Joint 2 (rotation around Z axis)
    joint2 = math.atan2(R_23[1, 0], R_23[0, 0])
    
    # Create rotation matrix for joint 2
    joint2_matrix = np.array([
        [math.cos(joint2), -math.sin(joint2), 0],
        [math.sin(joint2), math.cos(joint2), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the rotation matrix for joint 3
    joint2_inv = np.transpose(joint2_matrix)
    R_3 = np.matmul(joint2_inv, R_23)
    
    # Joint 3 (rotation around Y axis)
    joint3 = math.atan2(R_3[0, 2], R_3[2, 2])
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This solution:
1. Accounts for the TCP offset by transforming the target position and orientation back to link 3
2. Solves for joint 1 using the position of link 3
3. Computes the rotation matrix for joint 1
4. Calculates the combined rotation for joints 2 and 3
5. Solves for joint 2
6. Computes the rotation matrix for joint 2
7. Calculates the rotation for joint 3 alone
8. Solves for joint 3

The solution returns all three joint angles in radians as required.
