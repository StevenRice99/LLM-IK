Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF manipulator. Let me analyze the robot structure and extend the existing solution for the first two joints to include the third joint.

From the tests and details provided, I can see:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis
- The TCP has an additional fixed orientation offset of [0, 0, 1.57] radians

Let me complete the inverse kinematics function:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Define rotation matrices
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([[1, 0, 0], 
                         [0, np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), 0, np.sin(angle)], 
                         [0, 1, 0], 
                         [-np.sin(angle), 0, np.cos(angle)]])

    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([[np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle), 0], 
                         [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle), 0], 
                         [0, 0, 1]])
    
    # Calculate target rotation matrix
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)
    
    # Account for the fixed TCP orientation offset (pi/2 around z-axis)
    tcp_offset = rot_z(1.570796325)
    R_target_adjusted = R_target @ tcp_offset.T
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Apply joint 1 rotation to find remaining rotations
    R_joint1 = rot_y(joint1)
    R_remaining = R_joint1.T @ R_target_adjusted
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint2 = math.atan2(R_remaining[1, 0], R_remaining[0, 0])
    
    # Apply joint 2 rotation to find the final rotation
    R_joint2 = rot_z(joint2)
    R_final = R_joint2.T @ R_remaining
    
    # Calculate joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint3 = math.atan2(-R_final[2, 0], R_final[0, 0])
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This solution:
1. Calculates the target rotation matrix from the given Euler angles
2. Accounts for the fixed TCP orientation offset (pi/2 around z-axis)
3. Calculates joint 1 angle based on the target position
4. Applies joint 1 rotation to find the remaining rotation needed
5. Calculates joint 2 angle from the remaining rotation
6. Applies joint 2 rotation to find the final rotation needed
7. Calculates joint 3 angle from the final rotation

The solution follows the same approach as the existing code for the first two joints, but extends it to include the third joint.
