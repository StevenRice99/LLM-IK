Based on the feedback, my inverse kinematics solution was incorrect. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided and develop a proper solution.

I need to understand the relationship between the target position/orientation and the joint angles. Let me analyze the robot's structure more carefully:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints with axes Y, Z, Y respectively
2. The links have specific dimensions that affect the forward kinematics
3. The orientation representation is in Euler angles

Let me develop a more accurate inverse kinematics solution:

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. The feedback shows that my solution is not working correctly. Let me analyze the examples more carefully:

For example, for the target position [-0.08516097146293901, 0.09431595032070901, -0.092074913598884] and orientation [2.82437712923186, 1.460897340408463, 0.14630903185173302], the correct joint values were [-1.679530425900148, 1.5548059695416891, -0.46265433153602].
