I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 3-DOF serial manipulator. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's structure and movement patterns.

Based on the FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests, I can see:

1. The robot has 3 revolute joints with axes Y, Z, Y respectively
2. When all joints are at 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
3. Joint 1 (Y-axis) rotates the entire arm around the Y-axis
4. Joint 2 (Z-axis) rotates the subsequent links around the Z-axis
5. Joint 3 (Y-axis) rotates the TCP around the Y-axis

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    l1 = 0.093  # Distance from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # First, determine joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # When joint 1 rotates, it changes the x and z coordinates
    if x == 0 and z == 0:
        # Special case: target is along the Y-axis
        theta1 = 0
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Rotate the target point back to the YZ plane to solve for joints 2 and 3
    # This gives us the distance in the YZ plane from the origin to the target
    dist_yz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # The Y coordinate in the rotated frame
    y_rotated = y
    
    # The Z coordinate in the rotated frame (distance from origin in the XZ plane)
    z_rotated = dist_yz
    
    # Now we have a 2D problem in the YZ plane to solve for theta2 and theta3
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset and orientation
    # The TCP has an offset and is rotated relative to joint 3
    # We need to find where joint 3 should be to place the TCP at the target
    
    # For orientation, we need to consider r[0] (rotation around X) which affects the TCP orientation
    # Joint 3 contributes to this orientation
    theta3 = r[0]
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 given the TCP position and orientation
    # The TCP is offset by l3 in a direction determined by theta3
    j3_y = y_rotated - l3 * math.sin(theta3)
    j3_z = z_rotated - l3 * math.cos(theta3)
    
    # Now solve for theta2 using the position of joint 3
    # We need to find the angle that places joint 3 at (j3_y, j3_z)
    # This is a simple trigonometry problem
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    dist_j2_to_j3 = math.sqrt((j3_y - l1)**2 + j3_z**2)
    
    # Ensure the target is reachable
    if dist_j2_to_j3 > l2:
        # Target is too far, but we're assuming all targets are reachable
        # So we'll just place joint 3 as close as possible
        dist_j2_to_j3 = l2
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    theta2 = math.atan2(j3_y - l1, j3_z) - math.asin(0)  # No offset needed
    
    # Adjust theta2 to account for the orientation requirement
    # Joint 2 (Z-axis) affects the overall orientation
    theta2 = r[2] - theta3 - math.pi/2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

1. Joint 1 (Y-axis) rotates around Y, affecting X and Z coordinates
2. Joint 2 (Z-axis) rotates around Z, affecting X and Y coordinates
3. Joint 3 (Y-axis) rotates around Y, affecting orientation primarily

Let me revise my solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot's geometry
    l1 = 0.093    # Distance from base to joint 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3
    l3 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Joint 1 (Y-axis) affects the distribution of the target position between X and Z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    dist_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Joint 3 (Y-axis) primarily affects the orientation
    # From the tests, we can see that joint 3 contributes to rx
    theta3 = rx
    
    # The TCP has an offset in the Y direction when joint 3 is at 0
    # When joint 3 rotates, this offset changes direction
    # Calculate the position of joint 3 given the TCP position and orientation
    j3_x = x - l3 * math.sin(theta3) * math.sin(theta1)
    j3_y = y - l3 * math.cos(theta3)
    j3_z = z - l3 * math.sin(theta3) * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Joint 2 (Z-axis) needs to be calculated to position joint 3 correctly
    # From the tests, we can see that joint 2 contributes to rz
    # The relationship appears to be: rz = joint2 + pi/2
    theta2 = rz - math.pi/2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me complete the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".

    """
    import numpy as np
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # From the forward kinematics tests, we can determine:
    # - Joint 1 (Y-axis) rotates the arm around Y, affecting X and Z
    # - Joint 2 (Z-axis) rotates around Z, affecting the orientation
    # - Joint 3 (Y-axis) rotates around Y, affecting the orientation
    
    # Joint 1 calculation
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 3 calculation - from the tests, joint 3 contributes to rx
    theta3 = rx
    
    # Joint 2 calculation - from the tests, joint 2 contributes to rz
    # When joint 2 = 0, rz = pi/2, and when joint 2 = pi/2, rz = pi
    theta2 = rz - math.pi/2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
