Based on the forward kinematics tests, I can now develop the inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot. Let me analyze the robot structure and the test results:

1. The robot has 2 revolute joints:
   - Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
   - Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
   - The TCP has a fixed offset from joint 2

2. From the test results, I can see how the joint values affect the end-effector position and orientation.

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.09465  # Length of link 1 (Z offset to joint 2)
    L2 = 0.0823   # Length of TCP offset from joint 2
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to account for the TCP offset and the desired orientation
    
    # First, calculate the position relative to joint 1
    # We need to rotate the target point back by -joint1 to get it in the local frame
    x_local = x * math.cos(-joint1) - y * math.sin(-joint1)
    y_local = x * math.sin(-joint1) + y * math.cos(-joint1)
    z_local = z
    
    # The TCP has a fixed orientation offset of pi/2 (1.57...) around Z
    # We need to account for this when calculating joint 2
    
    # For joint 2, we need to find the angle that places the TCP at the target position
    # Given the geometry, we can use atan2 to find this angle
    joint2 = math.atan2(x_local - L2 * math.sin(rz - joint1), z_local - L1)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider my approach. Let me analyze the forward kinematics more carefully:

1. When both joints are 0, the TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
2. When joint 1 is rotated, it rotates the entire arm around the Z-axis
3. When joint 2 is rotated, it rotates the TCP around the Y-axis

Let me revise my solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.09465  # Length of link 1 (Z offset to joint 2)
    L2 = 0.0823   # Length of TCP offset from joint 2
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the target position
    # First, calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    xy_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The TCP is offset by L2 in the Y direction of the local frame
    # When joint 2 rotates, this offset creates a circular arc
    # We need to find the angle that places the TCP at the correct height (z)
    
    # Calculate the required joint 2 angle
    joint2 = math.atan2(z - L1, xy_dist)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

I need to refine this further. Let me reconsider the problem:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.09465  # Length of link 1 (Z offset to joint 2)
    L2 = 0.0823   # Length of TCP offset from joint 2
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation in the XY plane
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider both the position and orientation
    # The TCP has a fixed orientation offset of pi/2 (1.57...) around Z
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    xy_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # This is the angle needed to reach the target height (z)
    # and account for the TCP offset
    joint2 = math.atan2(z - L1, xy_dist)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After analyzing the forward kinematics tests more carefully, I see that I need to account for the orientation as well. Let me provide the final solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Constants from the robot description
    L1 = 0.09465  # Length of link 1 (Z offset to joint 2)
    L2 = 0.0823   # Length of TCP offset from joint 2
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to account for the TCP offset and the desired orientation
    
    # The TCP has a fixed orientation offset of pi/2 (1.57...) around Z
    # When joint 2 is at 0, the TCP is at [0, L2, L1]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    xy_dist = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 based on the target position
    # This is the angle needed to reach the target height (z)
    joint2 = math.atan2(z - L1, xy_dist)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
