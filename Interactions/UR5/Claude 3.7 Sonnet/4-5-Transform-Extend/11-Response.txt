I see the issue now. Looking at the feedback, I notice that my solution for joint2 is correct (it matches rx), but my solution for joint1 is still incorrect. In some cases, the joint1 value is correct in magnitude but has the wrong sign.

Let me analyze the examples more carefully:

Example 1:
- Orientation: [-3.07046, -0.12758, -0.08942]
- Correct joint1: -1.66022
- My joint1: 1.66022 (wrong sign)

Example 2:
- Orientation: [3.13939, 0.00000, 2.29964]
- Correct joint1: 0.72884
- My joint1: -0.72884 (wrong sign)

Example 3:
- Orientation: [2.69764, 0.77093, 1.20002]
- Correct joint1: -0.37078
- My joint1: 0.37078 (wrong sign)

I notice that in all cases, the magnitude of joint1 is correct, but the sign is often wrong. Let me try a different approach by analyzing the relationship between the target position and joint1:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the x-component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    # For joint 1, I need to consider the position
    # Looking at the examples, I notice that joint1 is related to the atan2(y, x) of the position
    # Let's calculate the angle in the XY plane
    xy_angle = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Now, I need to determine the correct sign for joint1
    # Looking at the examples, I notice that when x is positive, joint1 has the opposite sign of xy_angle
    # When x is negative, joint1 has the same sign as xy_angle
    
    # Calculate the magnitude of joint1 based on rz
    if joint2 >= 0:
        joint1_mag = abs(-rz + math.pi/2)
    else:
        joint1_mag = abs(-rz - math.pi/2)
    
    # Normalize to [0, π]
    while joint1_mag > math.pi:
        joint1_mag -= 2 * math.pi
    joint1_mag = abs(joint1_mag)
    
    # Determine the sign based on the position
    if x >= 0:
        if y >= 0:
            joint1 = -joint1_mag
        else:
            joint1 = joint1_mag
    else:
        if y >= 0:
            joint1 = joint1_mag
        else:
            joint1 = -joint1_mag
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    while joint1 > math.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while joint1 < -math.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After further analysis, I realize I need a more direct approach. Let me try a different solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the x-component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    # For joint 1, I'll use the atan2 of the position
    xy_angle = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Based on the examples, joint1 seems to be related to xy_angle and rz
    # Let's try a direct approach: joint1 = xy_angle - π
    joint1 = xy_angle - math.pi
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    while joint1 > math.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while joint1 < -math.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After more careful analysis of all examples, I see that the relationship is more complex. Let me try one more approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the x-component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    # For joint 1, after analyzing all examples, I see that:
    # joint1 = atan2(y, x) - π
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x) - math.pi
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    while joint1 > math.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while joint1 < -math.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
