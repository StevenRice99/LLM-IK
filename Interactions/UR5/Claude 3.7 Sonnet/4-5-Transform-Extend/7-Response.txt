I'll now develop the inverse kinematics solution for the 2-DOF manipulator based on the information provided and the forward kinematics tests.

From the details and forward kinematics tests, I can see:
1. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
2. Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
3. The TCP is offset from joint 2 by [0, 0.0823, 0] in local coordinates

Let me analyze the forward kinematics to understand the transformation:

When both joints are at 0:
- TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
- Orientation is [0, 0, 1.5707963]

When joint 1 is at 1.57 (π/2) and joint 2 is at 0:
- TCP is at [-0.0823, ~0, 0.09465]
- This shows joint 1 rotates the entire arm around Z

When joint 1 is at 0 and joint 2 is at 1.57 (π/2):
- TCP orientation changes to [1.57, ~0, 1.5707963]
- This confirms joint 2 rotates around Y

Now I'll complete the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # This determines the orientation of the arm in the XY plane
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # We need to account for the TCP offset (0.0823 in Y direction)
    # and the Z offset of joint 2 (0.09465)
    
    # First, calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    xy_distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # The TCP is offset by 0.0823 in the Y direction of the local frame
    # We need to account for this offset when calculating joint 2
    # When joint 2 is 0, this offset is perpendicular to the arm
    
    # The effective distance from joint 2 to TCP in the XY plane
    tcp_offset = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate joint 2 using the arctangent of the height difference and XY distance
    # adjusted for the TCP offset
    joint2 = math.atan2(z - 0.09465, xy_distance - tcp_offset)
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Wait, I need to reconsider this solution. The TCP offset is in the local Y direction after joint 2, and the orientation also matters. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    import numpy as np
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # The TCP is offset from joint 2 by [0, 0.0823, 0] in local coordinates
    # We need to find the position of joint 2 by removing this offset
    
    # Joint 1 rotates around Z, so it determines the orientation in XY plane
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # For joint 2, we need to consider the orientation
    # Since joint 2 rotates around Y, it affects the rx component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Actually, I need to be more careful with this. Let me reconsider the problem more thoroughly:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # Since joint 2 rotates around Y, it directly corresponds to rx
    joint2 = rx
    
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
