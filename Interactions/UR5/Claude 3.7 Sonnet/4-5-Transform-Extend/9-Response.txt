Based on the feedback, I can see that my inverse kinematics solution was incorrect. Let me analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback to understand the relationship between the target position/orientation and the joint angles.

Looking at the examples:
1. For position [0.08197, -0.00735, 0.09465] and orientation [-3.07046, -0.12758, -0.08942], the correct joints were [-1.66022, -3.07046]
2. For position [-0.05481, 0.06139, 0.09465] and orientation [3.13939, 0.00000, 2.29964], the correct joints were [0.72884, 3.13939]

I notice a pattern: the second joint value (joint2) matches the x-component of the orientation (rx). This confirms my approach for joint2.

However, my approach for joint1 was incorrect. Looking at the correct values, I see that joint1 is not simply atan2(y, x) of the target position.

Let me develop a correct solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the x-component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    # For joint 1, we need to consider both the position and the z-component of orientation
    # Looking at the examples, joint1 seems to be related to rz
    # Let's analyze the relationship between joint1 and rz
    
    # From the examples, it appears that joint1 = rz - π/2 when joint2 is near 0
    # and joint1 = rz + π/2 when joint2 is near π or -π
    
    # This suggests a relationship like:
    if abs(joint2) < math.pi/2:
        joint1 = rz - math.pi/2
    else:
        joint1 = rz + math.pi/2
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    while joint1 > math.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while joint1 < -math.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

Let me refine this further by looking at more examples from the feedback:

For example 3:
- Position: [0.02982, 0.07671, 0.09465]
- Orientation: [2.69764, 0.77093, 1.20002]
- Correct joints: [-0.37078, 2.69764]

For example 6:
- Position: [0.06093, 0.05533, 0.09465]
- Orientation: [0.94812, 0.00000, 0.73730]
- Correct joints: [-0.83350, 0.94812]

I see that my approach for joint1 is still not correct. Let me revise:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the x-component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    # For joint 1, we need to analyze the relationship with rz
    # Looking at all examples, I notice that joint1 + rz is approximately constant
    # when joint2 is near 0, and joint1 - rz is approximately constant when joint2 is near π
    
    # Let's try a different approach based on the examples
    if abs(joint2) < math.pi/2:
        joint1 = -rz
    else:
        joint1 = -rz + math.pi
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    while joint1 > math.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while joint1 < -math.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After further analysis of the examples, I see that the relationship is more complex. Let me try a different approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the x-component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    # For joint 1, we need to consider the relationship with rz
    # Based on the examples, it appears that joint1 = -rz + π/2 when joint2 is near 0
    # and joint1 = -rz - π/2 when joint2 is near π or -π
    
    if abs(math.sin(joint2)) < 0.5:  # When joint2 is near 0 or π
        joint1 = -rz + math.pi/2
    else:
        joint1 = -rz - math.pi/2
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    while joint1 > math.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while joint1 < -math.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    return (joint1, joint2)
```

After more careful analysis of all examples, I see that the relationship is even more complex. Let me try one more approach:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 2 directly corresponds to the x-component of orientation
    joint2 = rx
    
    # For joint 1, after analyzing all examples, I see that:
    # joint1 = -rz - π/2 when joint2 is in [-π, 0]
    # joint1 = -rz + π/2 when joint2 is in [0, π]
    
    if joint2 >= 0:
        joint1 = -rz + math.pi/2
    else:
        joint1 = -rz - math.pi/2
    
    # Normalize to [-π, π]
    while joint1 > math.pi:
        joint1 -= 2 * math.pi
    while joint1 < -math.pi:
        joint1 += 2 * math.pi
        
    return (joint1, joint2)
```
