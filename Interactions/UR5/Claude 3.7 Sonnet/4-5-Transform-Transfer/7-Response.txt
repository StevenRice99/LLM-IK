I see that I need to develop a complete inverse kinematics solution for this 2-DOF robot that accounts for both position and orientation. Let me analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the robot's behavior.

From the FORWARD_KINEMATICS tests, I can observe:

1. When both joints are at 0:
   - TCP position: [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
   - TCP orientation: [0, 0, 1.5707963249999999]

2. When joint1 = 1.57 (π/2) and joint2 = 0:
   - TCP position: [-0.0823, ~0, 0.09465]
   - TCP orientation: [0, 0, 3.140796325]

3. When joint1 = 0 and joint2 = 1.57 (π/2):
   - TCP position: [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
   - TCP orientation: [1.57, ~0, 1.5707963267934673]

Based on these observations and the robot description:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis
- Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis
- L1 = 0.09465 (height of first link)
- L2 = 0.0823 (length of second link)

Now I'll develop the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    L1 = 0.09465  # Height of first link
    L2 = 0.0823   # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The orientation rx corresponds to the rotation around X-axis, which is controlled by joint2
    theta2 = rx
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

Wait, I need to verify this solution. Let me think more carefully about the relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector position and orientation.

From the forward kinematics tests, I can see that:
- Joint 1 (rotation around Z) affects the X-Y position of the end effector
- Joint 2 (rotation around Y) affects the orientation of the end effector

Let me complete the solution:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    import math
    
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    L1 = 0.09465  # Height of first link
    L2 = 0.0823   # Length of second link
    
    # Calculate joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # When we rotate around Z, the X and Y coordinates change
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Calculate joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    # The rx value (rotation around X-axis) is directly controlled by joint2
    theta2 = rx
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
