To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the given 1-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired target position p = (px, py, pz). Given the constraints, the solution involves using trigonometric functions to relate the joint angle to the target coordinates.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Manipulator Structure:**
   - The manipulator has a single revolute joint rotating around the Z-axis.
   - The TCP is offset by 0.13585 meters in the Y-direction from the joint.

2. **Formulate the Forward Kinematics:**
   - The TCP's position in the world frame is determined by rotating the local TCP position [0, 0.13585, 0] by the joint angle θ around the Z-axis.
   - Using the rotation matrix for Z-axis rotation, the TCP's world coordinates become:
     - x = -0.13585 * sinθ
     - y = 0.13585 * cosθ
     - z = 0 (fixed)

3. **Set Up Equations for Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Given a target position p = (px, py, pz), we know pz must be 0.
   - Set the equations:
     - -0.13585 * sinθ = px
     - 0.13585 * cosθ = py

4. **Solve for θ:**
   - From the equations, express sinθ and cosθ in terms of px and py.
   - Use the arctangent function to find θ, ensuring the correct quadrant is considered.

5. **Implement the Solution in Code:**
   - Use the `math.atan2` function to compute θ, which correctly handles the signs of px and py to determine the angle in the correct quadrant.

**Final Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    theta = math.atan2(-px, py)
    return theta
```
