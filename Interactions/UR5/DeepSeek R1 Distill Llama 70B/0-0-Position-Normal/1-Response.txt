To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired coordinates. The TCP moves in the XY-plane, and its position is a function of the joint angle θ. Using trigonometric relationships, we derive the angle θ using the arctangent function, considering the signs of the target coordinates to ensure the correct quadrant.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta = math.atan2(-x, y)
    return theta
```
