To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1 degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The manipulator consists of a revolute joint rotating around the Z-axis, with the TCP located at [0, 0.13585, 0] in its local frame.

2. **Formulate the Kinematic Equation**: The position of the TCP in the world frame when the joint rotates by θ radians is given by:
   - x = 0.13585 * sin(θ)
   - y = 0.13585 * cos(θ)
   - z = 0

3. **Derive the Inverse Kinematics Solution**: Given a target position [x_target, y_target, 0], solve for θ using the arctangent function to account for the correct quadrant.

4. **Implement the Solution in Code**: Use the `math.atan2` function to compute the joint angle θ.

Here is the implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Computes the joint angle needed to reach the given position.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the target position [x, y, z].
        
    Returns:
        The joint angle in radians needed to reach the target position.
    """
    x_target, y_target, _ = p  # Ignore z since it's always 0
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctan2 to handle the correct quadrant
    theta = math.atan2(x_target, y_target)
    return theta
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angle to position the TCP at the desired location within the reachable workspace.
