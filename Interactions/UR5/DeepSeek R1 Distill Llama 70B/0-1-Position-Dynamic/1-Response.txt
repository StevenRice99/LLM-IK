To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, y, z). The solution involves calculating these angles using geometric and trigonometric relationships.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Robot Geometry:**
   - The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (theta1) rotates around the Z-axis, and the second joint (theta2) rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is located at a specific offset from the second joint.

2. **Express TCP Position in Terms of Joint Angles:**
   - Using rotation matrices, express the TCP's position as a function of theta1 and theta2.
   - Apply the rotation matrices for theta1 (Rz) and theta2 (Ry) to the TCP's offset and link offset.

3. **Derive Equations for Each Coordinate:**
   - After applying the rotations, derive equations for x, y, and z in terms of theta1 and theta2.
   - Solve for theta2 using the z-coordinate equation.
   - Use the x and y equations to set up a system to solve for theta1.

4. **Solve for Theta2:**
   - From the z equation, compute theta2 using the arccosine function.

5. **Solve for Theta1:**
   - Using the derived equations for x and y, set up a system of linear equations in terms of cos(theta1) and sin(theta1).
   - Solve this system to find theta1 using the arctangent function.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of two floats representing the joint angles theta1 and theta2.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Calculate theta2 using the z-coordinate
    cos_theta2 = z_d / 0.425
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Calculate A and B for theta1 calculation
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615

    # Calculate the denominator for C and S
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2

    # Calculate cos(theta1) and sin(theta1)
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator

    # Calculate theta1 using atan2
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This code calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates by solving the inverse kinematics equations step by step. It first determines theta2 using the z-coordinate and then solves for theta1 using the x and y coordinates, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position accurately.
