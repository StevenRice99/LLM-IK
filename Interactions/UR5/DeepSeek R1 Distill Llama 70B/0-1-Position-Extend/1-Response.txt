To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Compute theta2** using the z-coordinate of the target position.
2. **Calculate sin(theta2)** using the Pythagorean identity.
3. **Determine cos(theta1)** from the y-coordinate.
4. **Find sin(theta1)** using the x-coordinate and the previously computed values.
5. **Calculate theta1** using the atan2 function to get the correct quadrant.

Here is the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate theta2 using arccos on the z component
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - (z / 0.425) ** 2)

    # Calculate cos(theta1) from the y component
    cos_theta1 = (y + 0.1197) / 0.13585

    # Calculate sin(theta1) from the x component and sin(theta2)
    sin_theta1 = (0.425 * sin_theta2 - x) / 0.13585

    # Calculate theta1 using atan2 to get the correct quadrant
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function first determines the second joint angle (theta2) using the z-coordinate. It then calculates the necessary components for the first joint angle (theta1) using the x and y coordinates. The use of atan2 ensures that theta1 is in the correct quadrant, providing an accurate solution for the inverse kinematics problem.
