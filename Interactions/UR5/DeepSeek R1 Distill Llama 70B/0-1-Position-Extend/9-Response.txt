To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that will position the tool center point (TCP) at a desired location [x_d, y_d, z_d]. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Robot Configuration

- **Link 1:** Revolute joint rotating around the Z-axis.
- **Link 2:** Revolute joint rotating around the Y-axis.
- **TCP:** Attached to Link 2 with a fixed position [0, -0.1197, 0.425].

### Step 2: Derive the Forward Kinematics Equations

Using homogeneous transformation matrices, we derive the position of the TCP in terms of theta1 and theta2:

\[
x = 0.13585 \cos(\theta2) \cos(\theta1) - 0.1197 \sin(\theta2)
\]
\[
y = 0.13585 \cos(\theta2) \sin(\theta1) + 0.1197 \cos(\theta2)
\]
\[
z = 0.13585 \sin(\theta2) + 0.425
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Theta2 Using the Z-Coordinate

From the z-equation:
\[
z_d = 0.13585 \sin(\theta2) + 0.425
\]
\[
\sin(\theta2) = \frac{z_d - 0.425}{0.13585}
\]
\[
\theta2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{z_d - 0.425}{0.13585}\right)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for Theta1 Using the X and Y Coordinates

Using the x and y equations:
\[
x_d = 0.13585 \cos(\theta2) \cos(\theta1) - 0.1197 \sin(\theta2)
\]
\[
y_d = 0.13585 \cos(\theta2) \sin(\theta1) + 0.1197 \cos(\theta2)
\]

Rearrange to solve for sin(theta1) and cos(theta1):
\[
\cos(\theta1) = \frac{x_d + 0.1197 \sin(\theta2)}{0.13585 \cos(\theta2)}
\]
\[
\sin(\theta1) = \frac{y_d - 0.1197 \cos(\theta2)}{0.13585 \cos(\theta2)}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Theta1 Using atan2

Use the atan2 function to determine theta1, ensuring the correct quadrant:
\[
\theta1 = \text{atan2}(\sin(\theta1), \cos(\theta1))
\]

### Step 6: Implement the Solution in Python

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Calculate theta2 using the z-coordinate
    sin_theta2 = (z_d - 0.425) / 0.13585
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)

    # Calculate cos(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)

    # Calculate sin(theta1) and cos(theta1) using x and y coordinates
    numerator_sin = y_d - 0.1197 * cos_theta2
    numerator_cos = x_d + 0.1197 * sin_theta2

    denominator = 0.13585 * cos_theta2

    if denominator == 0:
        # Handle division by zero if cos(theta2) is zero
        # This would require a different approach, possibly using a different equation
        # For simplicity, assume it's not zero in this implementation
        raise ValueError("cos(theta2) is zero, causing division by zero.")

    sin_theta1 = numerator_sin / denominator
    cos_theta1 = numerator_cos / denominator

    # Ensure sin_theta1 and cos_theta1 are within valid ranges
    sin_theta1 = max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cos_theta1 = max(min(cos_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate theta1 using atan2 to get the correct quadrant
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Step 7: Test the Function

Test the function with sample positions to ensure it calculates the correct joint angles. If the function fails to reach the desired position, check for calculation errors or consider handling edge cases where cos(theta2) is zero.

By following these steps, you can analytically solve the inverse kinematics problem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator and determine the necessary joint angles to reach the desired TCP position.
