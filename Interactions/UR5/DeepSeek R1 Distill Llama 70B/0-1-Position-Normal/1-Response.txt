To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates p = (x, y, z). The approach involves the following steps:

1. **Compute theta2**: Using the z-coordinate, we determine theta2 by recognizing that z = 0.425 * cos(theta2). This gives us theta2 = arccos(z / 0.425).

2. **Compute sin(theta2)**: Using the Pythagorean identity, sin(theta2) is derived from cos(theta2).

3. **Calculate E**: This term combines the known link length and sin(theta2).

4. **Solve for theta1**: Using the x and y coordinates, we set up a system of linear equations to solve for cos(theta1) and sin(theta1), ensuring they satisfy the unit circle identity.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles theta1 and theta2 to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple (theta1, theta2) in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    z_max = 0.425  # Maximum z-coordinate based on the TCP position
    
    # Step 1: Compute theta2 from z
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Step 2: Compute sin(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    
    # Step 3: Compute E
    E = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    
    # Step 4: Compute denominator
    denominator = E ** 2 + (0.01615) ** 2
    
    # Step 5: Compute cos(theta1) and sin(theta1)
    cos_theta1 = (E * x + 0.01615 * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (E * y - 0.01615 * x) / denominator
    
    # Ensure cos^2(theta1) + sin^2(theta1) = 1 (within numerical precision)
    norm = math.sqrt(cos_theta1 ** 2 + sin_theta1 ** 2)
    cos_theta1 /= norm
    sin_theta1 /= norm
    
    # Step 6: Compute theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, considering the geometric constraints and ensuring the solution is within the reachable workspace.
