To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate theta2**: Using the z-component of the target position, we find theta2 using the arccosine function.
2. **Compute S and C**: Determine sin(theta2) and cos(theta2).
3. **Determine K and L**: K is 0.425 times S, and L is 0.01615.
4. **Solve for cos(theta1) and sin(theta1)**: Using the derived equations, compute the cosine and sine of theta1.
5. **Find theta1**: Use the arctangent function to determine theta1 from sin(theta1) and cos(theta1).

Here is the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the z-component
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Compute sin(theta2) and cos(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate K and L
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    
    # Compute the denominator
    denominator = K**2 + L**2
    
    # Calculate cos(theta1) and sin(theta1)
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctan2
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach the desired TCP position, considering the geometric constraints and using trigonometric identities to solve the system of equations.
