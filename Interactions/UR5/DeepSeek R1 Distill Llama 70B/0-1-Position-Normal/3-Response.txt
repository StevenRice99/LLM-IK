To address the issues in theinverse kinematics function, we'll make the following improvements:

1. **Remove Normalization**: Since the problem guarantees reachable targets, the initial calculations should already satisfy the trigonometric identity, making normalization unnecessary and potentially introducing errors.

2. **Handle Multiple Solutions**: Ensure all possible solutions are considered and the correct one is selected.

3. **Relax Verification Tolerance**: Increase the tolerance in the verification step to accept closer approximations.

Here's the revised function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x_des, y_des, z_des = p

    # Calculate theta2 candidates
    z_scale = z_des / 0.425
    if abs(z_scale) > 1.0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)  # Not reachable, but problem states all are reachable

    theta2_candidates = [math.acos(z_scale), -math.acos(z_scale)]

    solutions = []

    for theta2 in theta2_candidates:
        sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
        cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)

        # Calculate cos and sin for theta1 without normalization
        cos_theta1 = (x_des + 0.425 * sin_theta2) / 0.13585
        sin_theta1 = (y_des + 0.1197) / 0.13585

        # Check if the values are within valid range
        if abs(cos_theta1) > 1.0 or abs(sin_theta1) > 1.0:
            continue

        # Calculate theta1
        theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

        # Verify the solution by forward kinematics with relaxed tolerance
        x_fk = 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1) - 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
        y_fk = 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1) - 0.1197
        z_fk = 0.425 * math.cos(theta2)

        if (math.isclose(x_fk, x_des, rel_tol=1e-5) and
            math.isclose(y_fk, y_des, rel_tol=1e-5) and
            math.isclose(z_fk, z_des, rel_tol=1e-5)):
            solutions.append((theta1, theta2))

    if solutions:
        return (solutions[0][0], solutions[0][1])
    else:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

- **Removed Normalization**: The step where `sin_theta1` and `cos_theta1` were normalized has been removed. This prevents unnecessary adjustments that could introduce errors.

- **Relaxed Tolerance**: The relative tolerance in the `math.isclose` function has been increased to `1e-5` to accept solutions that are sufficiently close to the target, accommodating minor numerical inaccuracies.

- **Simplified Solution Handling**: The function now directly calculates `theta1` from `sin_theta1` and `cos_theta1` without normalization, ensuring that the trigonometric identity is maintained as per the problem's constraints.

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly compute the joint angles and pass the verification step, allowing the robot to reach the desired target positions accurately.
