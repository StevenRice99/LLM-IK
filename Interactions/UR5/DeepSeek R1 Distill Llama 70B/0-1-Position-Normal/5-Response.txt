To address the issues in theinverse kinematics function, we need to ensure that all possible solutions for theta2 are considered and that the calculated joint angles fall within the allowable range. Here's the revised function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x_des, y_des, z_des = p

    # Calculate theta2 candidates
    z_scale = z_des / 0.425
    if abs(z_scale) > 1.0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)  # Not reachable, but problem states all are reachable

    theta2_candidates = [math.acos(z_scale), -math.acos(z_scale)]

    solutions = []

    for theta2 in theta2_candidates:
        # Adjust theta2 to be within the range [-pi, pi]
        theta2_adjusted = theta2
        if theta2_adjusted > math.pi:
            theta2_adjusted -= 2 * math.pi
        elif theta2_adjusted < -math.pi:
            theta2_adjusted += 2 * math.pi

        sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2_adjusted)
        cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2_adjusted)

        # Calculate cos and sin for theta1
        cos_theta1 = (x_des + 0.425 * sin_theta2) / 0.13585
        sin_theta1 = (y_des + 0.1197) / 0.13585

        # Check if the values are within valid range
        if abs(cos_theta1) > 1.0 or abs(sin_theta1) > 1.0:
            continue

        # Calculate theta1
        theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

        # Verify the solution by forward kinematics with relaxed tolerance
        x_fk = 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1) - 0.425 * math.sin(theta2_adjusted)
        y_fk = 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1) - 0.1197
        z_fk = 0.425 * math.cos(theta2_adjusted)

        if (math.isclose(x_fk, x_des, rel_tol=1e-5) and
            math.isclose(y_fk, y_des, rel_tol=1e-5) and
            math.isclose(z_fk, z_des, rel_tol=1e-5)):
            solutions.append((theta1, theta2_adjusted))

    if solutions:
        return (solutions[0][0], solutions[0][1])
    else:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Adjusted Theta2 Candidates**: The function now adjusts each theta2 candidate to ensure it falls within the range of [-pi, pi]. This is done by subtracting or adding 2*pi as necessary.

2. **Relaxed Tolerance in Verification**: The tolerance in the `math.isclose` function has been relaxed to `1e-5` to accept solutions that are sufficiently close to the target, accommodating minor numerical inaccuracies.

3. **Handling of Multiple Solutions**: By considering all possible theta2 candidates and adjusting them within the allowable range, the function now correctly identifies valid joint angles that reach the desired TCP position.

4. **Removal of Normalization Step**: The step where `sin_theta1` and `cos_theta1` were normalized has been removed, as the problem guarantees that all targets are reachable, ensuring that the trigonometric identity holds without needing adjustment.

By implementing these changes, the function should now correctly compute the joint angles and pass the verification step, allowing the robot to reach the desired target positions accurately.
