To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Solve for Joint 2 (φ):**
   - Use the z-component of the desired position to find φ using the arccosine function.
   
2. **Solve for Joint 1 (θ):**
   - Use the x and y components of the desired position to set up a system of equations.
   - Solve this system to find θ using trigonometric identities.

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Solve for joint2 (phi) using the z-component
    z_tcp = 0.425  # From the TCP's local z position
    phi = math.acos(z / z_tcp)
    sin_phi = math.sqrt(1 - (z / z_tcp)**2)
    
    # Constants
    A = 0.425 * sin_phi
    B = 0.1197
    
    # Solve for joint1 (theta) using x and y components
    denominator = A**2 + B**2
    cos_theta = (A * x - B * y) / denominator
    sin_theta = (A * y + B * x) / denominator
    
    theta = math.atan2(sin_theta, cos_theta)
    
    return (theta, phi)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. It first determines the angle for the second joint using the z-coordinate, then solves for the first joint using the x and y coordinates. The solution assumes the orientation is achievable once the position is correctly reached.
