To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1 and theta2) that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's a step-by-step solution:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**:
   - **Joint 1**: Revolute joint rotating around the Z-axis, positioned at the origin [0, 0, 0].
   - **Joint 2**: Revolute joint rotating around the Y-axis, positioned at [0, 0.13585, 0].
   - **TCP**: Located at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to Joint 2.

2. **Derive Forward Kinematics Equations**:
   - **Position of Joint 2**:
     ```
     P2 = [ -0.13585 * sin(theta1), 0.13585 * cos(theta1), 0 ]
     ```
   - **Position of TCP**:
     ```
     P_tcp = [ -0.13585 * sin(theta1) + 0.425 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) + 0.1197 * sin(theta1),
                0.13585 * cos(theta1) + 0.425 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1) - 0.1197 * cos(theta1),
                0.425 * cos(theta2) ]
     ```

3. **Inverse Kinematics Solution**:
   - **Solve for theta2** using the z-component of the target position:
     ```
     theta2 = arccos(z_target / 0.425)
     ```
   - **Solve for theta1** using the x and y components, considering the calculated theta2:
     ```
     theta1 = arccos( (y_target + 0.1197) / 0.13585 )
     ```

4. **Implementation**:
   - Use the derived equations to compute theta1 and theta2.
   - Ensure the arguments for the arccos function are within the valid range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors.

### Final Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Calculate theta2 using the z-component of the target position
    # Ensure the argument for acos is within [-1, 1]
    z_ratio = z_target / 0.425
    if z_ratio < -1.0:
        z_ratio = -1.0
    elif z_ratio > 1.0:
        z_ratio = 1.0
    theta2 = math.acos(z_ratio)

    # Calculate theta1 using the y-component of the target position
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by the second link
    y_adjusted = y_target + 0.1197
    # Ensure the argument for acos is within [-1, 1]
    y_ratio = y_adjusted / 0.13585
    if y_ratio < -1.0:
        y_ratio = -1.0
    elif y_ratio > 1.0:
        y_ratio = 1.0
    theta1 = math.acos(y_ratio)

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation

- **Theta2 Calculation**: The z-component of the target position is used to determine theta2. The ratio of the target z-value to the length of the second link (0.425) is computed and passed to `math.acos()` to find the angle. The ratio is clamped between -1 and 1 to avoid domain errors.

- **Theta1 Calculation**: The y-component of the target position is adjusted for the offset introduced by the second link. The adjusted y-value is then used to compute theta1 using `math.acos()`, ensuring the ratio is within the valid range.

This approach efficiently calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, considering the robot's structure and movement constraints.
