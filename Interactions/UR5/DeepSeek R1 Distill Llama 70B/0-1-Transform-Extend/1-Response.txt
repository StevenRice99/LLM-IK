To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Extract the Desired Position and Orientation**: The function takes the desired position `p` and orientation `r` as inputs.

2. **Solve for Theta2 Using the Z-Coordinate**: Using the desired z-coordinate, we calculate theta2 by taking the arccosine of the ratio of the desired z to the TCP's z-offset.

3. **Compute Sine of Theta2**: Since theta2 is in the range [0, π], the sine of theta2 is non-negative and can be computed using the Pythagorean identity.

4. **Solve for Theta1 Using X and Y Coordinates**: Using the desired x and y coordinates, we compute the sine and cosine of theta1. The sine of theta1 is derived from the x-coordinate equation, and the cosine from the y-coordinate equation.

5. **Calculate Theta1**: Using the computed sine and cosine values, theta1 is determined using the arctangent function, ensuring the correct quadrant.

6. **Return the Joint Angles**: The computed theta1 and theta2 are returned as the solution.

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the z-coordinate
    cos_theta2 = z / 0.425
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)  # sin(theta2) is non-negative as theta2 is in [0, π]
    
    # Solve for theta1 using x and y coordinates
    sin_theta1 = (0.425 * sin_theta2 - x) / 0.13585
    cos_theta1 = (y + 0.1197) / 0.13585
    
    # Ensure sin^2 + cos^2 = 1 (within a small tolerance)
    if not (abs(sin_theta1**2 + cos_theta1**2 - 1) < 1e-6):
        raise ValueError("The target position is not reachable.")
    
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation, ensuring the robot's TCP moves accurately to the target.
