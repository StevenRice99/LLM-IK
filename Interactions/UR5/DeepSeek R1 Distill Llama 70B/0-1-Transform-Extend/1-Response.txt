To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Extract theta2 from the target position's z-component.**
2. **Compute the necessary sine and cosine of theta2.**
3. **Set up the system of equations for the x and y components.**
4. **Solve for theta1 using matrix inversion.**
5. **Return the joint angles.**

Here's the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    A = 0.56085  # Combined length of links
    B = -0.01615
    C = 0.01615
    
    pz = p[2]
    
    # Calculate theta2 from pz
    theta2 = math.acos(pz / A)
    s2 = math.sin(theta2)
    c2 = math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate coefficients for theta1 equations
    M = A * s2
    N = B
    P = A * s2
    Q = C
    
    px, py = p[0], p[1]
    
    # Calculate determinant
    det = M * P - N * Q
    
    # Solve for cos(theta1) and sin(theta1)
    cos_theta1 = (P * px - N * py) / det
    sin_theta1 = (M * py - Q * px) / det
    
    # Ensure cos^2 + sin^2 = 1 (within some tolerance)
    norm = math.sqrt(cos_theta1**2 + sin_theta1**2)
    cos_theta1 /= norm
    sin_theta1 /= norm
    
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation by first solving for theta2 using the z-component of the target position, then solving for theta1 using the x and y components. The solution assumes the target is reachable as per the problem constraints.
