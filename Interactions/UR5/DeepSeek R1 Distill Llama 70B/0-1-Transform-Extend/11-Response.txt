To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 2-DOF robot arm, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure:**
   - The robot has two revolute joints with known link lengths and offsets.
   - The TCP's position and orientation are determined by the joint angles theta1 and theta2.

2. **Set Up Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   - Express the TCP's position (x, y, z) and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in terms of theta1 and theta2.
   - Use trigonometric functions to relate the joint angles to the TCP's coordinates.

3. **Formulate the Inverse Kinematics Problem:**
   - Set the forward kinematics equations equal to the desired position and orientation.
   - This results in a system of nonlinear equations that need to be solved for theta1 and theta2.

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Use analytical methods or numerical techniques to solve for theta1 and theta2.
   - Consider using the Jacobian matrix and iterative methods for more complex cases.

5. **Implement the Solution in Code:**
   - Translate the derived equations into a function that calculates theta1 and theta2 given a target position and orientation.
   - Ensure the function handles edge cases and potential singularities.

By following these steps, you can determine the joint angles needed for the robot to reach the desired position and orientation.
