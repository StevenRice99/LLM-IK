To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we'll use a more robust approach that incorporates both position and orientation by utilizing the Jacobian matrix. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define Forward Kinematics:**
   - Express the TCP position and orientation in terms of joint angles theta1 and theta2.
   - Use rotation matrices to account for the orientation of each link.

2. **Compute the Jacobian Matrix:**
   - The Jacobian relates the joint rates to the TCP velocities in both position and orientation.
   - Include both translational and rotational components.

3. **Invert the Jacobian:**
   - Use the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to find the joint rate changes needed to reach the target.

4. **Integrate Joint Rates:**
   - Integrate the joint rates over time to obtain the new joint angles.

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r" using Jacobian inverse.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

        return position, orientation

This function uses the Jacobian inverse method to iteratively adjust the joint angles until the target position and orientation are reached. It accounts for both positional and orientational goals, providing a more accurate solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
