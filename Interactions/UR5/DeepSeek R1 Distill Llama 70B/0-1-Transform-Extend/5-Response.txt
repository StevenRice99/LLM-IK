To resolve the dimension mismatcherror in the Jacobian matrix, we need to ensure that both the position and orientation Jacobians have the same number of columns. Here's the corrected approach:

1. **Modify the Orientation Jacobian (`Jr`):**
   - Change `Jr` from a 3x3 identity matrix to a 3x2 matrix, where each column represents the derivative of the orientation with respect to each joint angle.

2. **Adjust the Jacobian Construction:**
   - Ensure that both `Jp` and `Jr` are 3x2 matrices before vertically stacking them to form the complete Jacobian matrix.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r" using Jacobian inverse.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.13585  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.425    # Length of the second link
    TCP_OFFSET = np.array([0, -0.1197, 0.425])  # TCP offset from joint2

    # Current joint angles (initial guess)
    theta1 = 0.0
    theta2 = 0.0

    # Jacobian matrix
    def jacobian(theta1, theta2):
        # Position Jacobian
        Jp = np.zeros((3, 2))
        Jp[:, 0] = np.array([(-L1 * np.sin(theta1) - L2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)),
                              (L1 * np.cos(theta1) + L2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)),
                              0])
        Jp[:, 1] = np.array([(-L2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)),
                             (L2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)),
                             0])

        # Orientation Jacobian (3x2 matrix)
        Jr = np.zeros((3, 2))
        # Assuming orientation is only affected by theta1
        Jr[:, 0] = np.array([1, 0, 0])  # Partial derivative with respect to theta1
        Jr[:, 1] = np.array([0, 0, 0])   # No effect from theta2 on orientation

        # Combine position and orientation Jacobian
        J = np.vstack((Jp, Jr))
        return J

    # Target position and orientation
    target_position = np.array(p)
    target_orientation = np.array(r)

    # Current position and orientation
    def forward_kinematics(theta1, theta2):
        # Position
        x = L1 * np.cos(theta1) + L2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)
        y = L1 * np.sin(theta1) + L2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)
        z = 0  # Since all movements are in the plane
        position = np.array([x, y, z]) + TCP_OFFSET

        # Orientation (Euler angles)
        orientation = np.array([theta1, 0, 0])  # Only theta1 affects orientation

        return position, orientation

    # Calculate current position and orientation
    current_position, current_orientation = forward_kinematics(theta1, theta2)

    # Error
    error_position = target_position - current_position
    error_orientation = target_orientation - current_orientation

    # Compute Jacobian
    J = jacobian(theta1, theta2)

    # Compute Jacobian inverse
    J_inv = np.linalg.pinv(J)

    # Update joint angles
    joint_rates = J_inv @ np.concatenate((error_position, error_orientation))
    theta1 += joint_rates[0]
    theta2 += joint_rates[1]

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Orientation Jacobian (`Jr`):**
   - Changed from a 3x3 identity matrix to a 3x2 matrix.
   - Only the first column is set to `[1, 0, 0]`, assuming that only `theta1` affects the orientation.
   - The second column is set to `[0, 0, 0]`, indicating no effect from `theta2` on orientation.

2. **Jacobian Matrix Construction:**
   - Both `Jp` and `Jr` are now 3x2 matrices.
   - When stacked vertically, they form a 6x2 Jacobian matrix, which is compatible for inversion.

3. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - Simplified the orientation calculation to only include `theta1`, reflecting that `theta2` does not affect the orientation in this planar robot.

By making these adjustments, the Jacobian matrix dimensions align correctly, resolving the ValueError and allowing the inverse kinematics solution to proceed without errors.
