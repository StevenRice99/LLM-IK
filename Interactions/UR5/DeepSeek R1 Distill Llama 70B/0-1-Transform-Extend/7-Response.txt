To resolve the dimension mismatcherror and improve the accuracy of the inverse kinematics solution, we'll make the following corrections:

1. **Adjust the Orientation Jacobian (`Jr`):**
   - Change `Jr` from a 3x3 identity matrix to a 3x2 matrix, where only the first column is relevant since the second joint doesn't affect orientation.

2. **Ensure Consistent Dimensions:**
   - Both `Jp` and `Jr` will be 3x2 matrices, allowing them to be stacked into a 6x2 Jacobian matrix.

3. **Simplify Orientation Handling:**
   - Since the robot is planar, the orientation is primarily influenced by `theta1`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r" using Jacobian inverse.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.13585  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.425    # Length of the second link
    TCP_OFFSET = np.array([0, -0.1197, 0.425])  # TCP offset from joint2

    # Current joint angles (initial guess)
    theta1 = 0.0
    theta2 = 0.0

    # Jacobian matrix
    def jacobian(theta1, theta2):
        # Position Jacobian
        Jp = np.zeros((3, 2))
        Jp[:, 0] = np.array([(-L1 * np.sin(theta1) - L2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)),
                              (L1 * np.cos(theta1) + L2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)),
                              0])
        Jp[:, 1] = np.array([(-L2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)),
                             (L2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)),

        # Only theta1 affects orientation
        Jr[:, 0] = np.array([1, 0, 0])
        Jr[:, 1] = np.array([0, 0, 0])

        # Combine position and orientation Jacobian
        J = np.vstack((Jp, Jr))
        return J

    # Target position and orientation
    target_position = np.array(p)
    target_orientation = np.array(r)

    # Current position and orientation
    def forward_kinematics(theta1, theta2):
        # Position
        x = L1 * np.cos(theta1) + L2 * np.cos(theta1 + theta2)
        y = L1 * np.sin(theta1) + L2 * np.sin(theta1 + theta2)
        z = 0  # Since all movements are in the plane
        position = np.array([x, y, z]) + TCP_OFFSET

        # Orientation (Euler angles)
        orientation = np.array([theta1, 0, 0])  # Only theta1 affects orientation

        return position, orientation

    # Calculate current position and orientation
    current_position, current_orientation = forward_kinematics(theta1, theta2)

    # Error
    error_position = target_position - current_position
    error_orientation = target_orientation - current_orientation

    # Compute Jacobian
    J = jacobian(theta1, theta2)

    # Compute Jacobian inverse
    J_inv = np.linalg.pinv(J)

    # Update joint angles
    joint_rates = J_inv @ np.concatenate((error_position, error_orientation))
    theta1 += joint_rates[0]
    theta2 += joint_rates[1]

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Orientation Jacobian (`Jr`):**
   - Changed from a 3x3 identity matrix to a 3x2 matrix.
   - Only the first column is set to `[1, 0, 0]`, indicating that only `theta1` affects the orientation.
   - The second column is set to `[0, 0, 0]`, reflecting that `theta2` has no effect on orientation.

2. **Jacobian Matrix Construction:**
   - Both `Jp` and `Jr` are now 3x2 matrices.
   - When stacked vertically, they form a 6x2 Jacobian matrix, which is compatible for inversion.

3. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - Simplified the orientation calculation to only include `theta1`, as the robot's orientation is primarily influenced by the first joint in this planar setup.

By making these adjustments, the Jacobian matrix dimensions align correctly, resolving the ValueError and improving the accuracy of the inverse kinematics solution.
