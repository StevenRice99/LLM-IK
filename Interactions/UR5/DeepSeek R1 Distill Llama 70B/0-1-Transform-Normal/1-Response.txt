To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) that position the TCP at the desired location \( p \) with the desired orientation \( r \). The solution involves the following steps:

### Approach
1. **Compute \( q_2 \) from the desired z-position \( p_z \):**
   - Using the z-component of the TCP position, we can directly compute \( q_2 \) using the arccosine function since the TCP's z-position is directly related to \( \cos(q_2) \).

2. **Handle the special case when \( \sin(q_2) = 0 \):**
   - When \( \sin(q_2) = 0 \), \( q_2 \) is either 0 or \( \pi \). For these cases, solve for \( q_1 \) using the simplified equations derived from the forward kinematics.

3. **Compute \( \sin(q_1) \) and \( \cos(q_1) \) for the general case:**
   - Using the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics, solve for \( \sin(q_1) \) and \( \cos(q_1) \) using Cramer's rule, ensuring to handle the determinant correctly to avoid division by zero.

4. **Compute \( q_1 \) using the arctangent function:**
   - Use the computed \( \sin(q_1) \) and \( \cos(q_1) \) to find \( q_1 \) using \( \text{atan2} \).

### Solution Code
```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    import math

    px, py, pz = p

    # Compute q2 from p_z
    q2 = math.acos(pz / 0.425)
    s2 = math.sqrt(1 - (pz / 0.425)**2)

    if s2 == 0:
        # Handle q2 = 0 or Ï€
        if pz == 0.425:
            q2 = 0.0
        else:
            q2 = math.pi
        # Solve for q1
        if py == 0:
            q1 = 0.0
        else:
            q1 = math.atan2(-px, py)
    else:
        # Compute sin(q1) and cos(q1)
        numerator_sin = 0.01615 * px - 0.425 * s2 * py
        numerator_cos = -0.01615 * py - 0.425 * s2 * px
        denominator = -0.180625 * (s2 ** 2)

        sin_q1 = numerator_sin / denominator
        cos_q1 = numerator_cos / denominator

        # Compute q1 using atan2 to get the correct quadrant
        q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)

    return (q1, q2)
```

### Explanation
- **Computing \( q_2 \):** The z-component of the TCP position is directly related to \( \cos(q_2) \), allowing us to compute \( q_2 \) using the arccosine function.
- **Special Case Handling:** When \( \sin(q_2) = 0 \), the robot is fully extended or fully retracted, simplifying the equations for \( q_1 \).
- **General Case:** For other values of \( q_2 \), the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics is solved using Cramer's rule to find \( \sin(q_1) \) and \( \cos(q_1) \), ensuring numerical stability by correctly handling the determinant.
- **Computing \( q_1 \):** The arctangent function with two arguments (\( \text{atan2} \)) is used to determine \( q_1 \) accurately, considering the correct quadrant.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation.
