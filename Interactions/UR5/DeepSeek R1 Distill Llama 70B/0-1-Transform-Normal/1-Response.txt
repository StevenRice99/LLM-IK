To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. The approach involves converting the desired orientation into a rotation matrix and then extracting the necessary angles from this matrix. The position is used to find the remaining joint angle.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Convert Euler Angles to Rotation Matrix**: The desired orientation, given as Euler angles, is converted into a rotation matrix using the ZYX convention.

2. **Extract Rotation Components**: From the rotation matrix, extract the necessary elements to compute θ2 using the arctangent function.

3. **Compute Joint Angles from Position**: Using the desired position, compute θ1 by solving the equations derived from the forward kinematics.

The final code implementing this solution is:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Unpack the position and orientation
    p_x, p_y, p_z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Convert Euler angles to rotation matrix
    # Using the ZYX convention
    cr = np.cos(roll)
    sr = np.sin(roll)
    cp = np.cos(pitch)
    sp = np.sin(pitch)
    cy = np.cos(yaw)
    sy = np.sin(yaw)
    
    # Compute individual rotation matrices
    Rx = np.array([[1, 0, 0],
                   [0, cr, -sr],
                   [0, sr, cr]], dtype=np.float64)
    
    Ry = np.array([[cp, 0, sp],
                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-sp, 0, cp]], dtype=np.float64)
    
    Rz = np.array([[cy, -sy, 0],
                   [sy, cy, 0],
                   [0, 0, 1]], dtype=np.float64)
    
    # Compute the desired rotation matrix
    R_desired = np.dot(Rz, np.dot(Ry, Rx))
    
    # Extract the necessary elements for theta2 calculation
    g = R_desired[2, 0]
    i = R_desired[2, 2]
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = np.arctan2(-g, i)
    
    # Calculate theta1 from the position
    # We know p_z should be 0.425, but we use p_x and p_y
    theta1 = np.arctan2(-p_x, p_y)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles θ1 and θ2 to reach the desired TCP pose using analytical methods without optimization, ensuring an efficient and accurate solution.
