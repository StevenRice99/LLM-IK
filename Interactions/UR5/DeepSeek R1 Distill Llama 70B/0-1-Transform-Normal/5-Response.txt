To resolve the issue wherethe inverse kinematics function fails to reach the desired targets, we need to improve the calculation of the joint angles θ1 and θ2. The current approach has limitations, particularly in handling the direction and quadrant of the angles, leading to incorrect joint values. Here's a refined approach:

### Approach
1. **Express Forward Kinematics:** Define the relationship between joint angles and the TCP's position.
2. **Solve for Joint Angles:** Use the inverse kinematics equations to solve for θ1 and θ2 based on the desired position.
3. **Handle Quadrant Issues:** Use the sine of the angles to determine the correct signs.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Implement an iterative method to adjust the joint angles for better accuracy.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate theta2 using z
    cosθ2 = z / 0.425
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to avoid domain errors
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)

    # Calculate theta1 using y and x
    cosθ1 = (y + 0.1197) / 0.13585
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to avoid domain errors
    θ1 = math.acos(cosθ1)

    # Use sine to determine the correct quadrant
    sinθ1 = math.sqrt(1 - cosθ1 ** 2)
    if y + 0.1197 < 0:
        θ1 = -θ1

    sinθ2 = math.sqrt(1 - cosθ2 ** 2)
    if z < 0:
        θ2 = -θ2

    # Iterative refinement to improve accuracy
    for _ in range(10):
        # Calculate forward kinematics with current theta1 and theta2
        y_calculated = 0.13585 * math.cos(θ1) - 0.1197
        z_calculated = 0.425 * math.cos(θ2)
        
        # Adjust theta1 based on y error
        error_y = y - y_calculated
        θ1 += 0.1 * error_y

        # Adjust theta2 based on z error
        error_z = z - z_calculated
        θ2 += 0.1 * error_z

    return (θ1, θ2)
```

### Explanation
- **Clamping Values:** Ensures that the arguments to `math.acos` are within the valid range to prevent domain errors.
- **Quadrant Handling:** Uses the sine of the angles to adjust the signs of θ1 and θ2, ensuring they are in the correct quadrants.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Adjusts the joint angles iteratively to refine the solution, improving the accuracy of the TCP's position.

This approach addresses the issues in the original function by more accurately calculating the joint angles and ensuring they are in the correct quadrants, leading to better convergence to the desired TCP positions.
