To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) that position the TCP at the desired location \( p \) with the desired orientation \( r \). The solution involves the following steps:

### Approach
1. **Compute \( q_2 \) from the desired z-position \( p_z \):**
   - Using the z-component of the TCP position, compute \( q_2 \) using the arccosine function since the TCP's z-position is directly related to \( \cos(q_2) \).

2. **Handle the special case when \( \sin(q_2) = 0 \):**
   - When \( \sin(q_2) = 0 \), \( q_2 \) is either 0 or \( \pi \). For these cases, solve for \( q_1 \) using the simplified equations derived from the forward kinematics.

3. **Compute \( q_1 \) from the desired orientation \( r \):**
   - Use the desired orientation to compute \( q_1 \) by considering the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP's orientation.

4. **Implement the solution in code:**
   - Update the `inverse_kinematics` function to incorporate both position and orientation calculations, ensuring that the TCP reaches the desired pose accurately.

### Solution Code
```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    import math

    L1 = 0.13585  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.1197   # Length of the second link
    L3 = 0.425    # Offset of the TCP along the z-axis

    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Compute q2 from the z-position
    q2 = math.acos(pz / L3)
    s2 = math.sin(q2)

    if s2 == 0:
        # Handle the case when q2 is 0 or Ï€
        if pz == L3:
            q2 = 0.0
        else:
            q2 = math.pi
        # Solve for q1 using the x and y positions and orientation
        if py == 0 and px == 0:
            q1 = 0.0
        else:
            # Compute q1 based on position and orientation
            q1 = rz - q2
    else:
        # Use the desired orientation to compute q1
        q1 = rz - q2

    return (q1, q2)
```

### Explanation
- **Computing \( q_2 \):** The z-component of the TCP position is directly related to \( \cos(q_2) \), allowing us to compute \( q_2 \) using the arccosine function.
- **Special Case Handling:** When \( \sin(q_2) = 0 \), the robot is fully extended or fully retracted, simplifying the equations for \( q_1 \).
- **Computing \( q_1 \):** The desired orientation \( r_z \) is used to compute \( q_1 \) by considering the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP's orientation.
- **Implementation:** The updated code incorporates both position and orientation calculations, ensuring that the TCP reaches the desired pose accurately.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation.
