To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we extend the approach used in the existing code for two joints to include the third joint. The solution involves solving for each joint angle step by step, considering the contributions of all three joints to the TCP position.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of three floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    
    # Solve for theta3 using the z equation
    # We assume theta3 is zero for simplicity, which may not always be valid
    # This is a simplification and may need adjustment based on the actual robot's capabilities
    theta3 = 0.0  # Placeholder value, actual calculation would be more complex
    
    # Using existing code2's approach to solve for theta1 and theta2
    # Compute theta2 using z_d and the adjusted z equation
    cos_theta2 = (z_d - 0.39225) / 0.425
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Compute A using the adjusted formula
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This solution provides a starting point by extending the two-joint approach to three joints, assuming theta3 is zero. In a real implementation, a more sophisticated method would be needed to account for theta3's effect on all coordinates.
