To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate theta2**: Using the z-coordinate of the target position, we determine theta2 using the arccosine function.
2. **Compute K and L**: K is derived from theta2, and L is a constant from the robot's geometry.
3. **Determine theta1**: Using the x and y components of the target position, we solve for theta1 using a system of equations.
4. **Set theta3**: Since theta3 does not affect the TCP's position, it is set to zero.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2 using z-coordinate
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Calculate K and L
    K = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    L = 0.01615
    
    # Calculate theta1
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    if denominator == 0:
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
        sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
        theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Theta3 is set to 0.0 as it doesn't affect the position
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering the robot's geometry and constraints.
