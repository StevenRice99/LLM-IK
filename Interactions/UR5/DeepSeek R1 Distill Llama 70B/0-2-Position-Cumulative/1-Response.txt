To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-DOF robot arm, we build upon the existing solutions for the first two joints and extend it to include the third joint. The approach involves:

1. **Solving for the first two joints (theta1 and theta2)** using the existing solution, which considers the target position's projection onto the X-Y plane and the height contributed by the second joint.

2. **Calculating the position contributed by the first two joints (P12)** by applying their respective rotation matrices and translation vectors.

3. **Determining the remaining position (v)** that the third joint needs to cover to reach the target.

4. **Computing the rotation matrix for the combined first two joints (R12)** and transforming the remaining position into this frame.

5. **Solving for theta3** using the transformed position, considering the third joint's rotation around the Y-axis.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple (theta1, theta2, theta3) in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution approach
    z_max = 0.425
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    E = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    denominator = E ** 2 + 0.01615 ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (E * x + 0.01615 * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (E * y - 0.01615 * x) / denominator
    norm = math.sqrt(cos_theta1 ** 2 + sin_theta1 ** 2)
    cos_theta1 /= norm
    sin_theta1 /= norm
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Define rotation matrices
    def rotation_z(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), -math.sin(theta), 0],
            [math.sin(theta), math.cos(theta), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    
    def rotation_y(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), 0, math.sin(theta)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-math.sin(theta), 0, math.cos(theta)]
        ])
    
    R1 = rotation_z(theta1)
    R2 = rotation_y(theta2)
    
    # Compute P12: position contributed by the first two joints
    joint2_pos = np.array([0, 0.13585, 0])
    P1 = R1 @ joint2_pos
    
    joint3_pos = np.array([0, -0.1197, 0.425])
    P2 = R1 @ R2 @ joint3_pos
    
    P12 = P1 + P2
    
    # Compute vector from P12 to target
    v = np.array(p) - P12
    
    # Compute combined rotation matrix R12 = R2 @ R1
    R12 = R2 @ R1
    
    # Transform v into the joint2 frame
    v_prime = R12.T @ v
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(v_prime[0], v_prime[2])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function first solves for the first two joint angles using geometric considerations, then calculates the necessary rotation for the third joint to reach the target position. The solution assumes the target is within the robot's reachable workspace.
