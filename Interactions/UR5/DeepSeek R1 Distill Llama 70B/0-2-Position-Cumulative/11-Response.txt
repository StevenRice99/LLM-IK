To address the inaccuraciesin reaching the target positions, we need to refine the inverse kinematics solution by ensuring the correct application of rotation matrices and accurate calculation of joint angles. Here's the revised approach:

1. **Correct the Order of Rotation Matrices:**
   - Ensure that the combined rotation matrix `R12` is calculated as `R1 @ R2` to correctly represent the sequence of joint rotations.

2. **Accurate Transformation of Vector `v`:**
   - Transform the vector `v` using the correct combined rotation matrix `R12` to accurately determine the required movement in the joint frame.

3. **Proper Calculation of `theta3`:**
   - Use the correct components of the transformed vector `v_prime` to compute `theta3`, ensuring the rotation aligns the TCP with the target position.

Here's the corrected code implementing these changes:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple (theta1, theta2, theta3) in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution approach
    z_max = 0.425
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain error
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    E = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    denominator = E ** 2 + 0.01615 ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (E * x + 0.01615 * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (E * y - 0.01615 * x) / denominator
    norm = math.sqrt(cos_theta1 ** 2 + sin_theta1 ** 2)
    cos_theta1 /= norm
    sin_theta1 /= norm
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Define rotation matrices
    def rotation_z(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), -math.sin(theta), 0],
            [math.sin(theta), math.cos(theta), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    
    def rotation_y(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), 0, math.sin(theta)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-math.sin(theta), 0, math.cos(theta)]
        ])
    
    R1 = rotation_z(theta1)
    R2 = rotation_y(theta2)
    
    # Compute P12: position contributed by the first two joints
    joint2_pos = np.array([0, 0.13585, 0])
    P1 = R1 @ joint2_pos
    
    joint3_pos = np.array([0, -0.1197, 0.425])
    P2 = R1 @ R2 @ joint3_pos
    
    P12 = P1 + P2
    
    # Compute vector from P12 to target
    v = np.array(p) - P12
    
    # Compute combined rotation matrix R12 = R1 @ R2
    R12 = R1 @ R2
    
    # Transform v into the joint2 frame
    v_prime = R12.T @ v
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(v_prime[0], v_prime[2])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Corrected Rotation Matrix Order:**
   - The combined rotation matrix `R12` is now correctly calculated as `R1 @ R2`, ensuring the proper sequence of joint rotations.

2. **Accurate Vector Transformation:**
   - The vector `v` is transformed using the correct combined rotation matrix `R12`, providing an accurate representation of the required movement in the joint frame.

3. **Proper Calculation of `theta3`:**
   - The calculation of `theta3` uses the correct components of the transformed vector `v_prime`, ensuring the rotation aligns the TCP accurately with the target position.

These corrections should enhance the accuracy of the joint angles calculated, allowing the TCP to reach the target positions as intended.
