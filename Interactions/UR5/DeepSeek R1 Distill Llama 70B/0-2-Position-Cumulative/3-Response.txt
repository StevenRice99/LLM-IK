To resolve the "math domainerror" when computing the inverse kinematics, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.acos` stays within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by clamping the z-coordinate of the target position to the robot's reachable range before performing the calculation.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Clamp z to the reachable range of the robot's z-axis
    z_clamped = max(-0.425, min(z, 0.425))
    # Calculate theta2 using arccos with clamped z value
    theta2 = math.acos(z_clamped / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    # Calculate K and L
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    # Calculate cos_theta1 and sin_theta1
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    # Calculate theta1 using atan2
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    # Set theta3 to 0 as we're focusing on position only
    theta3 = 0.0
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This modification ensures that the z-coordinate used in the calculation of theta2 is within the valid range, preventing the ValueError and allowing the inverse kinematics solution to be computed correctly.
