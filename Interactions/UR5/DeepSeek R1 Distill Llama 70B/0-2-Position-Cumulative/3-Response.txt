To resolve the "math domainerror" when calling `math.acos(z / 0.425)`, we need to ensure that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by clamping the z value before the calculation.

Here's the modified code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Clamp z to the valid range to prevent math domain error
    z_clamped = max(-0.425, min(z, 0.425))
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the clamped z value
    theta2 = math.acos(z_clamped / 0.425)
    
    # Calculate K and L
    K = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    L = 0.01615
    
    # Calculate theta1
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    if denominator == 0:
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
        sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
        theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Theta3 is set to 0.0 as it doesn't affect the position
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Clamping z Value**: Before calculating `theta2`, the z value is clamped to ensure it lies within the range [-0.425, 0.425]. This prevents the argument to `math.acos` from exceeding the valid range of [-1, 1], thus avoiding the "math domain error".

2. **Calculating theta2**: Using the clamped z value, `theta2` is computed using `math.acos`, which is now safe as the argument is within the valid range.

3. **Proceeding with theta1 and theta3**: The rest of the calculations for `theta1` and setting `theta3` to 0.0 remain unchanged.

This modification ensures that the function handles all reachable target positions without encountering a domain error.
