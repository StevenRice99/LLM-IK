To resolve the "math domainerror" when calculating theta2, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.acos()` is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by clamping the value of `cos_theta2` before using it in `math.acos()`. Here's the modified code:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple (theta1, theta2, theta3) in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution approach
    z_max = 0.425
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain error
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    E = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    denominator = E ** 2 + 0.01615 ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (E * x + 0.01615 * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (E * y - 0.01615 * x) / denominator
    norm = math.sqrt(cos_theta1 ** 2 + sin_theta1 ** 2)
    cos_theta1 /= norm
    sin_theta1 /= norm
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Define rotation matrices
    def rotation_z(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), -math.sin(theta), 0],
            [math.sin(theta), math.cos(theta), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    
    def rotation_y(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), 0, math.sin(theta)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-math.sin(theta), 0, math.cos(theta)]
        ])
    
    R1 = rotation_z(theta1)
    R2 = rotation_y(theta2)
    
    # Compute P12: position contributed by the first two joints
    joint2_pos = np.array([0, 0.13585, 0])
    P1 = R1 @ joint2_pos
    
    joint3_pos = np.array([0, -0.1197, 0.425])
    P2 = R1 @ R2 @ joint3_pos
    
    P12 = P1 + P2
    
    # Compute vector from P12 to target
    v = np.array(p) - P12
    
    # Compute combined rotation matrix R12 = R2 @ R1
    R12 = R2 @ R1
    
    # Transform v into the joint2 frame
    v_prime = R12.T @ v
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(v_prime[0], v_prime[2])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`:**
   - Added a line to clamp `cos_theta2` to the range [-1, 1] using `max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)`.
   - This ensures that `math.acos()` receives a valid input, preventing the "math domain error".

2. **Maintained Existing Logic:**
   - The rest of the code remains unchanged, as the primary issue was the unclamped value being passed to `math.acos()`.

This modification allows the function to handle target positions that might temporarily exceed the robot's reach during calculations, ensuring robustness against such errors.
