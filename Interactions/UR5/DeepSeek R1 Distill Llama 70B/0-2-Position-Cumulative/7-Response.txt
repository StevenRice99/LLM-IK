To address the inaccuraciesin reaching the target positions, we need to correct the order of the rotation matrices and ensure proper transformation of vectors. Here's the revised approach:

1. **Correct the Order of Rotation Matrices:**
   - The combined rotation matrix `R12` should be `R1 @ R2`, as the second joint's rotation is applied after the first.

2. **Accurate Transformation of Vector `v`:**
   - Transform the vector `v` using the correct combined rotation matrix `R12`, which now accurately represents the joint rotations.

3. **Proper Calculation of `theta3`:**
   - Use the correct components of `v_prime` to compute `theta3`, ensuring the rotation aligns the TCP correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple (theta1, theta2, theta3) in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution approach
    z_max = 0.425
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain error
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    E = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    denominator = E ** 2 + 0.01615 ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (E * x + 0.01615 * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (E * y - 0.01615 * x) / denominator
    norm = math.sqrt(cos_theta1 ** 2 + sin_theta1 ** 2)
    cos_theta1 /= norm
    sin_theta1 /= norm
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Define rotation matrices
    def rotation_z(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), -math.sin(theta), 0],
            [math.sin(theta), math.cos(theta), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    
    def rotation_y(theta):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(theta), 0, math.sin(theta)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-math.sin(theta), 0, math.cos(theta)]
        ])
    
    R1 = rotation_z(theta1)
    R2 = rotation_y(theta2)
    
    # Compute P12: position contributed by the first two joints
    joint2_pos = np.array([0, 0.13585, 0])
    P1 = R1 @ joint2_pos
    
    joint3_pos = np.array([0, -0.1197, 0.425])
    P2 = R1 @ R2 @ joint3_pos
    
    P12 = P1 + P2
    
    # Compute vector from P12 to target
    v = np.array(p) - P12
    
    # Compute combined rotation matrix R12 = R1 @ R2
    R12 = R1 @ R2
    
    # Transform v into the joint2 frame
    v_prime = R12.T @ v
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(v_prime[0], v_prime[2])
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Corrected Rotation Matrix Order:**
   - Changed `R12 = R2 @ R1` to `R12 = R1 @ R2` to correctly represent the combined rotation of the first joint followed by the second.

2. **Accurate Vector Transformation:**
   - Ensured that the vector `v` is transformed using the correct combined rotation matrix `R12`, which now accurately represents the joint rotations.

3. **Theta3 Calculation:**
   - Maintained the calculation of `theta3` using `math.atan2(v_prime[0], v_prime[2])`, which should now be more accurate due to the corrected transformations.

These changes should improve the accuracy of the joint angles, allowing the TCP to reach the target positions as intended.
