To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow a step-by-step analytical approach to determine the joint angles q1, q2, and q3 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates [x, y, z]. Here's the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for q1 using the atan2 of y and x
    q1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Compute A using the current q1
    A = x * math.cos(q1) + y * math.sin(q1)
    
    # Constants
    C = 0.39225  # From the TCP position relative to joint 3
    D = 0.425    # From joint 3's z-position
    
    # Step 3: Calculate cos(q3)
    numerator = A**2 + z**2 - C**2 - D**2
    denominator = 2 * C * D
    cos_q3 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Step 4: Solve for q3
    q3 = math.acos(cos_q3)
    
    # Step 5: Compute E and F for solving q2
    E = C * math.cos(q3) + D
    F = -C * math.sin(q3)
    
    # Step 6: Calculate phi
    phi = math.atan2(F, E)
    
    # Step 7: Solve for q2
    magnitude = math.sqrt(E**2 + F**2)
    q2 = phi + math.acos(z / magnitude)
    
    return (q1, q2, q3)
```

This function first determines q1 based on the xy-plane projection, then calculates q3 using the derived equations, and finally solves for q2. The approach ensures that each joint angle is computed analytically, providing an efficient solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
