To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we break down the problem into manageable steps, leveraging the existing solutions for sub-chains and extending them to the full chain.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Joint 1 (theta1):** Use the x and y components of the target position to determine the angle for the first joint using `atan2(-x, y)`.
2. **Transform Target Position:** Rotate the target position by `-theta1` around the Z-axis to get the local position in the y-z plane.
3. **Calculate Joint 2 and 3 (theta2 and theta3):** Treat the remaining problem as a 2-joint manipulator in the y-z plane. Use geometric methods to solve for the angles using the law of cosines and auxiliary angle techniques.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Calculate theta1 using the existing solution for joint1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Rotate the target position by -theta1 around Z to get local position
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    y_local = (-x * sin_theta1) + (y * cos_theta1)
    z_local = z  # z remains the same after rotation around Z

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 in the y-z plane
    # Define the lengths of the links
    L2 = 0.4412  # Length from joint2 to joint3
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint3 to TCP

    # Calculate the distance from the target to the origin in the y-z plane
    D = math.sqrt(y_local**2 + z_local**2)

    # Calculate C for the equation
    C = (y_local**2 + z_local**2 + L3**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L3)

    # Calculate alpha as the angle from y-axis to the target position
    alpha = math.atan2(z_local, y_local)

    # Calculate phi using the auxiliary angle method
    phi = alpha + math.acos(C / D)

    # Calculate theta2 using the equations derived
    cos_phi = math.cos(phi)
    sin_phi = math.sin(phi)

    numerator_y = y_local - L3 * cos_phi
    numerator_z = z_local - L3 * sin_phi
    denominator = L2

    # Avoid division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        theta2 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta2 = numerator_y / denominator
        sin_theta2 = numerator_z / denominator
        theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Calculate theta3 as the remaining angle
    theta3 = phi - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation:** The first joint's angle is determined by the direction towards the target in the x-y plane.
2. **Coordinate Transformation:** The target position is rotated to align with the local frame of joint1, simplifying the problem to a 2-joint system in the y-z plane.
3. **Geometric Solution for Theta2 and Theta3:** Using the law of cosines and auxiliary angles, the angles for the second and third joints are calculated to reach the desired position in the y-z plane.

This approach efficiently breaks down the problem, ensuring each joint's contribution is accurately calculated to achieve the target position.
