To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we will follow a systematic approach to determine the joint angles \( q_1, q_2, q_3 \) that position the TCP at the desired location \( p = [x, y, z] \).

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: 
   - The robot has three revolute joints with specific link lengths and offsets. The positions and orientations of each link are given in local coordinates relative to their parent link.

2. **Derive the Forward Kinematics**:
   - Calculate the position and orientation of the TCP based on the joint angles. This helps in formulating the inverse problem.

3. **Set Up the Inverse Kinematics Equations**:
   - Using the desired TCP position, set up equations based on the forward kinematics to solve for the joint angles.

4. **Solve for Joint Angles Sequentially**:
   - Start with solving for \( q_1 \) using the x and y components.
   - Substitute \( q_1 \) into the equations for the remaining components to solve for \( q_2 \) and \( q_3 \).

5. **Use Trigonometric Identities Carefully**:
   - Ensure that the use of arctangent and arccosine functions correctly handles the signs and ranges of angles.

6. **Validate the Solution**:
   - Test the derived joint angles by plugging them back into the forward kinematics to verify the TCP position.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.13585  # Length of link 2
    B = 0.1197    # Offset in y from link 2 to link 3
    a = 0.425     # Length of link 3
    b = 0.39225   # Length of TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for q1 using the y-component
    q1 = math.atan2(-x, y + B)

    # Step 2: Compute C and D for the remaining equations
    C = x + A * math.sin(q1)
    D = z

    # Step 3: Calculate cos_phi
    numerator = C**2 + D**2 - a**2 - b**2
    denominator = 2 * a * b
    cos_phi = numerator / denominator
    cos_phi = max(min(cos_phi, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    phi = math.acos(cos_phi)

    # Step 4: Compute K and L
    K = a + b * cos_phi
    L = b * math.sin(phi)

    # Step 5: Compute M and theta
    M = math.sqrt(K**2 + L**2)
    if M == 0:
        M = 1e-9  # Avoid division by zero, though theoretically unreachable
    theta = math.atan2(L, K)

    # Step 6: Solve for q2
    argument = D / M
    argument = max(min(argument, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    delta = math.acos(argument)
    q2 = theta + delta

    # Step 7: Solve for q3
    q3 = q2 - phi

    return (q1, q2, q3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Compute \( q_1 \)**: Using the arctangent function with adjusted x and y components to account for the first joint's rotation.
2. **Formulate Equations**: Substitute \( q_1 \) into the equations for the x and z components to create a system of equations.
3. **Solve for \( q_2 \) and \( q_3 \)**: Use trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation to reduce the system, solving for the angles using arccosine and arctangent functions.

This approach ensures that each joint's contribution is systematically considered, allowing the TCP to reach the desired position accurately.
