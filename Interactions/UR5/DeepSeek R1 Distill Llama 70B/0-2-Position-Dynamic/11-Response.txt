To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow a systematic approach to determine the joint angles required to reach a specified TCP position. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (θ1)
Joint 1 is responsible for rotating the entire arm in the X-Y plane. We calculate θ1 using the arctangent of the target's Y and X coordinates.

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y_{\text{target}}, x_{\text{target}})
\]

### Step 2: Adjust the Target Position
Rotate the target position by -θ1 around the Z-axis to align it in the Y-Z plane.

\[
x_{\text{adjusted}} = x_{\text{target}} \cos(\theta_1) + y_{\text{target}} \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y_{\text{adjusted}} = -x_{\text{target}} \sin(\theta_1) + y_{\text{target}} \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z_{\text{adjusted}} = z_{\text{target}}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Joint 3 (θ3)
Using the adjusted X and Z coordinates, calculate θ3.

\[
\theta_3 = \text{atan2}(x_{\text{adjusted}}, z_{\text{adjusted}})
\]

### Step 4: Solve for Joint 2 (θ2)
Using the adjusted Y and Z coordinates, calculate θ2.

\[
\theta_2 = \text{atan2}(y_{\text{adjusted}}, z_{\text{adjusted}})
\]

### Final Implementation
Here is the Python function implementing the above steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position using an accurate kinematic model.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the target position [x, y, z].
        
    Returns:
        A tuple of the joint angles [joint1, joint2, joint3] needed to reach the target position.
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Step 1: Solve for joint1 using the arctangent of y and x
    joint1 = math.atan2(y_target, x_target)

    # Step 2: Adjust the target position by rotating it by -joint1 around Z-axis
    adjusted_x = x_target * math.cos(joint1) + y_target * math.sin(joint1)
    adjusted_y = -x_target * math.sin(joint1) + y_target * math.cos(joint1)
    adjusted_z = z_target

    # Step 3: Solve for joint3 using the arctangent of adjusted_x and adjusted_z
    joint3 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)

    # Step 4: Solve for joint2 using the adjusted_y and adjusted_z
    joint2 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, adjusted_z)

    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This function accurately computes the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired location, considering the robot's structure and movement constraints.
