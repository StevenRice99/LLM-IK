To address the inaccuraciesin the inverse kinematics solution, we need to refine the geometric approach used to calculate the joint angles, particularly for theta2 and theta3. The current method isn't accurately solving for these angles, leading to the TCP not reaching the target positions. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the improved approach:

### Improved Approach
1. **Calculate Theta1:** Use the x and y components of the target position to determine theta1, as before.
2. **Transform Target Position:** Rotate the target position by -theta1 around the Z-axis to align it in the local y-z plane.
3. **Geometric Solution for Theta2 and Theta3:**
   - **Calculate Distance D:** Compute the distance from the origin to the target in the y-z plane.
   - **Law of Cosines:** Use the law of cosines to relate the link lengths and the target distance.
   - **Clamp C_over_D:** Ensure the argument passed to `math.acos()` is within the valid range of [-1, 1], preventing domain errors.
   - **Calculate Alpha and Phi:** Determine the angles needed to solve for theta2 and theta3.
   - **Solve for Theta2 and Theta3:** Use trigonometric identities to find the individual joint angles.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Calculate theta1 using the existing solution for joint1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Rotate the target position by -theta1 around Z to get local position
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    y_local = (-x * sin_theta1) + (y * cos_theta1)
    z_local = z  # z remains the same after rotation around Z

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 in the y-z plane
    # Define the lengths of the links
    L2 = 0.4412  # Length from joint2 to joint3
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint3 to TCP

    # Calculate the distance from the target to the origin in the y-z plane
    D = math.sqrt(y_local**2 + z_local**2)

    # Calculate C for the equation
    C = (y_local**2 + z_local**2 + L3**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L3)

    # Clamp C/D to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain error
    C_over_D = C / D
    C_over_D = max(min(C_over_D, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate alpha as the angle from y-axis to the target position
    alpha = math.atan2(z_local, y_local)

    # Calculate phi using the clamped value to avoid domain error
    phi = alpha + math.acos(C_over_D)

    # Calculate theta2 using the equations derived
    cos_phi = math.cos(phi)
    sin_phi = math.sin(phi)

    numerator_y = y_local - L3 * cos_phi
    numerator_z = z_local - L3 * sin_phi
    denominator = L2

    # Avoid division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        theta2 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta2 = numerator_y / denominator
        sin_theta2 = numerator_z / denominator
        theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Calculate theta3 as the remaining angle
    theta3 = phi - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Clamping C_over_D:** Ensures that the argument passed to `math.acos()` is within the valid range of [-1, 1], preventing domain errors.
2. **Geometric Derivations:** The approach uses the law of cosines and auxiliary angles to accurately solve for theta2 and theta3, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position.
3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The code checks for division by zero and handles it appropriately to avoid runtime errors.

This improved approach should provide more accurate joint angles, allowing the TCP to reach the target positions as specified.
