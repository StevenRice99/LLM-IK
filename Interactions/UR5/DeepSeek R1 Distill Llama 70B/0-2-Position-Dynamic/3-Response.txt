To address the inaccuraciesin the inverse kinematics solution, I will re-examine the geometric relationships and trigonometric manipulations. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the corrected approach:

1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: 
   - The robot has three revolute joints with specific link lengths and offsets. Understanding how each joint contributes to the TCP position is crucial.

2. **Derive the Forward Kinematics**:
   - Calculate the position and orientation of the TCP based on the joint angles. This helps in formulating the inverse problem.

3. **Set Up the Inverse Kinematics Equations**:
   - Using the desired TCP position, set up equations based on the forward kinematics to solve for the joint angles.

4. **Solve for Joint Angles Sequentially**:
   - Start with solving for \( q_1 \) using the x and y components.
   - Substitute \( q_1 \) into the equations for the remaining components to solve for \( q_2 \) and \( q_3 \).

5. **Use Trigonometric Identities Carefully**:
   - Ensure that the use of arctangent and arccosine functions correctly handles the signs and ranges of angles.

6. **Validate the Solution**:
   - Test the derived joint angles by plugging them back into the forward kinematics to verify the TCP position.

By meticulously following these steps and double-checking each mathematical derivation, the accuracy of the inverse kinematics solution can be improved to ensure the robot reaches the desired target positions effectively.
