To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Solve for Joint 1 (θ1)**: Determine the angle for Joint 1 using the arctangent of the target's Y and X coordinates. This sets the direction in the X-Y plane.

2. **Adjust the Target Position**: Rotate the target position by -θ1 to align it with the X-axis, simplifying the problem to the Y-Z plane.

3. **Solve for Joint 3 (θ3)**: Use the arctangent of the target's X and Z coordinates to find θ3, which helps in positioning the TCP along the X-Z plane.

4. **Solve for Joint 2 (θ2)**: With θ1 and θ3 known, compute θ2 using the remaining Y and Z components of the target position.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the target position [x, y, z].
        
    Returns:
        A tuple of the joint angles [joint1, joint2, joint3] needed to reach the target position.
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Solve for joint1 using the existing function
    joint1 = -math.atan2(x_target, y_target)
    
    # Adjust the target position by rotating it by -joint1 around Z-axis
    # This simplifies the problem to the Y-Z plane
    adjusted_x = x_target * math.cos(joint1) + y_target * math.sin(joint1)
    adjusted_y = -x_target * math.sin(joint1) + y_target * math.cos(joint1)
    adjusted_z = z_target
    
    # Solve for joint3 using the existing function
    joint3 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Now solve for joint2
    # Using the adjusted_y and adjusted_z
    joint2 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, adjusted_z)
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This function first determines the angle for Joint 1 to align the robot in the X-Y plane. It then adjusts the target position to focus on the Y-Z plane. Using the adjusted position, it solves for Joint 3 and finally determines Joint 2 to reach the target. This approach provides a closed-form analytical solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
