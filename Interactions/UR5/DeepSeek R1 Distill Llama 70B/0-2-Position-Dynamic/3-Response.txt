To resolve the `ValueError: math domain error` when calling `math.acos()`, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.acos()` is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This error occurs when the value of `C / D` exceeds these bounds, which can happen due to numerical precision issues or when the target position is near the limits of the manipulator's reach.

Here's the modified code with a solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Calculate theta1 using the existing solution for joint1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Rotate the target position by -theta1 around Z to get local position
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    y_local = (-x * sin_theta1) + (y * cos_theta1)
    z_local = z  # z remains the same after rotation around Z

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 in the y-z plane
    # Define the lengths of the links
    L2 = 0.4412  # Length from joint2 to joint3
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length from joint3 to TCP

    # Calculate the distance from the target to the origin in the y-z plane
    D = math.sqrt(y_local**2 + z_local**2)

    # Calculate C for the equation
    C = (y_local**2 + z_local**2 + L3**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L3)

    # Clamp C/D to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain error
    C_over_D = C / D
    C_over_D = max(min(C_over_D, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate alpha as the angle from y-axis to the target position
    alpha = math.atan2(z_local, y_local)

    # Calculate phi using the clamped value to avoid domain error
    phi = alpha + math.acos(C_over_D)

    # Calculate theta2 using the equations derived
    cos_phi = math.cos(phi)
    sin_phi = math.sin(phi)

    numerator_y = y_local - L3 * cos_phi
    numerator_z = z_local - L3 * sin_phi
    denominator = L2

    # Avoid division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        theta2 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta2 = numerator_y / denominator
        sin_theta2 = numerator_z / denominator
        theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Calculate theta3 as the remaining angle
    theta3 = phi - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Clamping `C_over_D`:** Before calling `math.acos()`, we clamp the value of `C_over_D` to ensure it lies within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This prevents the `ValueError` by handling numerical precision issues and edge cases where the target is near the manipulator's reach limits.

2. **Maintaining the Original Logic:** The core logic for calculating the joint angles remains unchanged. The clamping step is added as a safeguard to ensure the function handles all valid input cases gracefully.

This modification ensures that the inverse kinematics function works robustly for all reachable target positions within the manipulator's workspace.
