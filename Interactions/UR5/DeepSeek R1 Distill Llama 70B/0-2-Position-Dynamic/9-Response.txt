To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate theta1**: Determine the angle for the first joint using the arctangent of the TCP's Y and X coordinates.
2. **Rotate Coordinates**: Transform the TCP's Y and Z coordinates into a frame rotated by theta1 to simplify the problem into a planar two-link manipulator problem.
3. **Calculate Link Lengths**: Determine the lengths of the links from joint2 to joint3 (L2) and from joint3 to the TCP (L3).
4. **Compute Distance D**: Find the distance from joint2 to the TCP in the rotated frame.
5. **Determine Delta**: Use the law of cosines to find the angle difference between theta2 and theta3.
6. **Solve for theta2 and theta3**: Set up and solve the system of equations to find theta2 and theta3 using trigonometric identities and matrix inversion.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Rotate Y and Z by theta1
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = y * cos_theta1 + z * sin_theta1
    z_prime = -y * sin_theta1 + z * cos_theta1
    
    # Step 3: Define link lengths
    L2 = 0.496  # Distance from joint2 to joint3
    L3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint3 to TCP
    
    # Step 4: Calculate D
    D = math.sqrt(y_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Step 5: Calculate delta
    numerator = L2**2 + L3**2 - D**2
    denominator = 2 * L2 * L3
    if denominator == 0:
        delta = 0.0
    else:
        delta = math.acos(numerator / denominator)
    
    # Step 6: Calculate A, B, C, D
    cos_delta = math.cos(delta)
    sin_delta = math.sin(delta)
    A = L2 + L3 * cos_delta
    B = L3 * sin_delta
    C = L2 - L3 * sin_delta
    D_coeff = -L3 * sin_delta
    
    # Calculate determinant
    det_M = A * C - B * D_coeff
    
    # Calculate cos_phi and sin_phi
    if det_M == 0:
        # Handle division by zero, though problem states all targets are reachable
        cos_phi = 0.0
        sin_phi = 0.0
    else:
        cos_phi = (C * y_prime - B * z_prime) / det_M
        sin_phi = (A * z_prime - D_coeff * y_prime) / det_M
    
    # Ensure cos_phi and sin_phi are within valid range
    cos_phi = max(min(cos_phi, 1.0), -1.0)
    sin_phi = max(min(sin_phi, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_phi, cos_phi)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = theta2 - delta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3 to move the TCP to the desired position p. It uses analytical methods to solve the inverse kinematics problem without optimization, ensuring the solution is efficient and accurate.
