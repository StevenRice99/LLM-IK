To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we extend the existing solution for the first two joints to include the third joint. The approach involves using the existing solution to find the first two joint angles and then computing the third joint angle based on the desired position and the position achieved by the first two joints.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Use Existing Solution for First Two Joints:**
   - The existing solution calculates the joint angles θ1 and θ2 to reach a target position (x, y, z) assuming the third joint is at zero. This gives us the position (x', y', z') after the second joint.

2. **Compute Position After First Two Joints:**
   - Using θ1 and θ2, compute the position (x', y', z') of the third joint before considering the third joint's rotation.

3. **Calculate Third Joint Angle θ3:**
   - Determine θ3 by finding the angle needed to rotate the position (x', z') to the desired (x, z). This is done using the arctangent function to handle the rotation around the Y-axis.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Use existing solution to find theta1 and theta2
    theta1, theta2 = existing_solution((x, y, z))

    # Step 2: Compute x', y', z' based on theta1 and theta2
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)

    x_prime = 0.13585 * cos_theta1 + 0.425 * sin_theta2
    y_prime = 0.13585 * sin_theta1 - 0.1197
    z_prime = -0.13585 * cos_theta1 * sin_theta2 + 0.425 * cos_theta2

    # Step 3: Compute theta3
    numerator = z * x_prime - x * z_prime
    denominator = z * z_prime + x * x_prime

    if denominator == 0:
        if numerator == 0:
            theta3 = 0.0
        else:
            theta3 = math.pi / 2 if numerator > 0 else -math.pi / 2
    else:
        theta3 = math.atan2(numerator, denominator)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)

```

This solution first uses the existing method to find the first two joint angles, then computes the third joint angle based on the desired position and the position achieved by the first two joints. This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position considering all three joints.
