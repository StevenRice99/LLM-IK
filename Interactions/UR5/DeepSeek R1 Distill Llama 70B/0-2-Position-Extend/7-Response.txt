To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we extend the existing solution for the first two joints to include the third joint. The approach involves:

1. **Compute theta1 and theta2** using the existing method to position the third joint.
2. **Calculate the position of the third joint** based on theta2.
3. **Determine theta3** to adjust the TCP to the desired position.

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of three floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Step 1: Compute theta1 and theta2 using the existing method
    # This assumes the third joint is at a certain position
    cos_theta2 = z_d / 0.425
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615  # This value should be determined based on the robot's geometry
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)

    # Step 2: Calculate the position of the third joint based on theta2
    y3 = 0.13585 * math.sin(theta2)
    z3 = 0.425 * math.cos(theta2)

    # Step 3: Compute theta3 to adjust the TCP to the desired position
    # The TCP's position is affected by theta3
    A = y3 - y_d
    B = z_d - z3
    sin_theta3 = A / 0.39225
    cos_theta3 = B / 0.39225

    # Ensure the values are within the valid range for arcsin and arccos
    if abs(sin_theta3) > 1 or abs(cos_theta3) > 1:
        # This should not happen as per the problem statement
        pass

    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function first solves for the first two joints to position the third joint, then adjusts the third joint to move the TCP to the desired position. The solution assumes all targets are reachable as per the problem statement.
