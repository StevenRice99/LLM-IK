To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we extend the existing solution to include the third joint, ensuring all three joints are considered. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Length**: Determine the total length from the base to the TCP by summing the third link's length and the TCP's offset.
2. **Solve for Theta2**: Use the law of cosines to find theta2 based on the z-coordinate of the target position and the total length.
3. **Solve for Theta1**: Use trigonometric identities to find theta1 based on the x and y coordinates.
4. **Set Theta3**: Set theta3 to zero, focusing on position-only control.

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    total_length = 0.81725  # Sum of the third link and TCP offset
    theta2 = math.acos(z / total_length)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = total_length * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    theta3 = 0.0  # Assuming theta3 is zero for position calculation
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This approach ensures that all three joints are considered, improving the accuracy of the joint angles calculated to reach the target position.
