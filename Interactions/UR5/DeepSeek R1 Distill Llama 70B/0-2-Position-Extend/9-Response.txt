To resolve the `ValueError: math domain error` in the inverse kinematics function, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.acos()` is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This error occurs when `cos_theta2` is outside this range, which can happen if the target position is slightly unreachable. Here's how we can modify the function to handle this gracefully:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of three floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Step 1: Compute theta1 and theta2 using the existing method
    # This assumes the third joint is at a certain position
    cos_theta2 = z_d / 0.425
    
    # Clip cos_theta2 to the valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615  # This value should be determined based on the robot's geometry
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    if denominator == 0:
        # Handle division by zero to avoid runtime errors
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
        S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
        theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)

    # Step 2: Calculate the position of the third joint based on theta2
    y3 = 0.13585 * math.sin(theta2)
    z3 = 0.425 * math.cos(theta2)

    # Step 3: Compute theta3 to adjust the TCP to the desired position
    # The TCP's position is affected by theta3
    A = y3 - y_d
    B = z_d - z3
    sin_theta3 = A / 0.39225
    cos_theta3 = B / 0.39225

    # Ensure the values are within the valid range for arcsin and arccos
    sin_theta3 = max(min(sin_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)

    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Clipping `cos_theta2`:**
   - Added `cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)` to ensure the value passed to `math.acos()` is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This prevents the `ValueError` when `cos_theta2` is outside this range.

2. **Handling Division by Zero:**
   - Included a check for `denominator == 0` to avoid division by zero errors when computing `C` and `S`. If `denominator` is zero, `theta1` is set to 0.0 as a default value.

3. **Clipping `sin_theta3` and `cos_theta3`:**
   - Added clipping for `sin_theta3` and `cos_theta3` to ensure they are within the valid range for `math.atan2()`. This prevents any potential errors when computing `theta3`.

These modifications make the function more robust by handling edge cases where intermediate calculations might produce values outside the expected range, ensuring the function runs smoothly for valid inputs.
