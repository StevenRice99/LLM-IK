To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we'll follow a systematic approach based on geometric relationships and the law of cosines. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Kinematic Chain

The robot has three revolute joints:

1. **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
2. **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
3. **Revolute 3**: Rotates around the Y-axis.

The TCP is located at the end of the third link.

### Step 2: Define Link Lengths

From the provided positions:

- **Link 1**: From Revolute 1 to Revolute 2: 0.13585 units in the Y-direction.
- **Link 2**: From Revolute 2 to Revolute 3: Calculated as the Euclidean distance between [0, 0.13585, 0] and [0, -0.1197, 0.425], which is approximately 0.496 units.
- **Link 3**: From Revolute 3 to TCP: 0.39225 units in the Z-direction.

### Step 3: Decouple the Problem

1. **Calculate θ1**: Since Revolute 1 affects the X and Y positions, θ1 can be determined using the arctangent of the target's Y and X components.

   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
   \]

2. **Project the target position onto the Y-Z plane**: By ignoring the X component, we simplify the problem to two dimensions.

3. **Use the law of cosines**: With the projected target position, relate the distances between the joints to find θ2 and θ3.

### Step 4: Solve for θ2 and θ3

For the Y-Z plane:

- **Total Reach**: The sum of Link 2 and Link 3 lengths.
- **Law of Cosines**: Relates the target position to the joint angles.

\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(\theta)
\]

Where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of Link 2 and Link 3.
- \( c \) is the distance from the target to the base of Link 2.
- \( \theta \) is the angle between Link 2 and Link 3.

### Step 5: Implement the Solution

Here's the Python function implementing the above steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple (θ1, θ2, θ3) of joint angles in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    l2 = 0.496     # Length from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    l3 = 0.39225   # Length from Revolute 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate θ1
    if x == 0:
        theta1 = 0.0  # Handle division by zero
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan(y / x)
    
    # Project the target position onto the Y-Z plane
    target_yz = (y - l1 * math.sin(theta1), z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the target to the base of Link 2
    distance = math.sqrt(target_yz[0]**2 + target_yz[1]**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if distance > l2 + l3:
        raise ValueError("Target position is unreachable.")
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find θ2 and θ3
    cos_theta2 = (l2**2 + distance**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * distance)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta2 is within the valid range for arccos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    sin_theta3 = target_yz[1] / distance
    theta3 = math.asin(sin_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Step 6: Testing and Validation

After implementing the function, test it with known target positions to ensure the calculated joint angles correctly position the TCP. If the robot fails to reach certain targets, verify the calculations, especially the handling of edge cases like division by zero and out-of-reach targets.

By following this structured approach, we've derived a solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the 3-DOF robot arm, ensuring accurate positioning of the TCP.
