To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the Joint Variables**: Represent the joint angles as symbols using SymPy.
2. **Construct Transformation Matrices**: Build the transformation matrices for each joint using the DH parameters.
3. **Compute Total Transformation**: Multiply the transformation matrices to get the total transformation from the base to the TCP.
4. **Extract Translation Components**: From the total transformation matrix, extract the translation components (x, y, z) which represent the TCP position.
5. **Set Up Equations**: Set the extracted translation components equal to the desired position p.
6. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy's solve function to find the joint angles q1, q2, q3 that satisfy the equations.

Here's how the code can be implemented:

```python
import numpy as np
import sympy as sp

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    q1, q2, q3 = sp.symbols('q1 q2 q3')
    
    # Define the transformation matrices
    # T0_1: Base to Joint 1
    T0_1 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(q1), -sp.sin(q1), 0, 0],
        [sp.sin(q1), sp.cos(q1), 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # T1_2: Joint 1 to Joint 2
    T1_2 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(q2), 0, sp.sin(q2), 0.13585 * sp.cos(q2)],
        [sp.sin(q2), 0, -sp.cos(q2), 0.13585 * sp.sin(q2)],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # T2_3: Joint 2 to Joint 3
    T2_3 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(q3), 0, sp.sin(q3), -0.1197 * sp.cos(q3)],
        [sp.sin(q3), 0, -sp.cos(q3), -0.1197 * sp.sin(q3)],
        [0, 1, 0, 0.425],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # T3_TCP: Joint 3 to TCP
    T3_TCP = sp.Matrix([
        [1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0.39225],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Compute total transformation
    T0_TCP = T0_1 * T1_2 * T2_3 * T3_TCP
    
    # Extract translation components
    x = T0_TCP[0, 3]
    y = T0_TCP[1, 3]
    z = T0_TCP[2, 3]
    
    # Set up the equations
    eq1 = sp.Eq(x, p[0])
    eq2 = sp.Eq(y, p[1])
    eq3 = sp.Eq(z, p[2])
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (q1, q2, q3))
    
    # Return the solution as a tuple of floats
    return (float(solution[q1]), float(solution[q2]), float(solution[q3]))
```

This function uses SymPy to symbolically compute the transformation matrices and solve the resulting system of equations for the joint angles. The solution is then returned as a tuple of floats representing the required joint angles to reach the desired TCP position.
