To resolve the `ValueError: math domain error` when calling `math.acos(cos_q2)`, we need to ensure that the value of `cos_q2` is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This error occurs when `cos_q2` is outside this range, which can happen due to numerical precision issues or an unreachable target position. Given the problem constraints that all targets are reachable, we'll clamp `cos_q2` to the valid range before computing the arccosine.

Here's the modified code with the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Compute q2 using the z-coordinate
    z_offset = z - 0.425
    cos_q2 = z_offset / 0.39225

    # Clamp cos_q2 to the range [-1, 1] to prevent domain errors
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)

    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)
    sin_q2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_q2 ** 2)  # sin_q2 is non-negative as q2 is in [0, Ï€]

    # Compute B
    B = 0.39225 * sin_q2

    A = 0.13585

    # Compute determinant
    det = B ** 2 - A ** 2

    if det == 0:
        # This case should not occur as per problem statement
        q1 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_q1 = (B * x - A * (y + 0.25555)) / det
        sin_q1 = (-A * x + B * (y + 0.25555)) / det

        # Clamp values to handle floating point errors
        cos_q1 = max(min(cos_q1, 1.0), -1.0)
        sin_q1 = max(min(sin_q1, 1.0), -1.0)

        q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)

    # Set q3 to 0 as orientation is not specified
    q3 = 0.0

    return (q1, q2, q3)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clamping `cos_q2`:**
   - Added `cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)` to ensure `cos_q2` is within the valid range for `math.acos`.

2. **Clamping `cos_q1` and `sin_q1`:**
   - Similarly, `cos_q1` and `sin_q1` are clamped to their respective valid ranges to prevent any potential domain errors in subsequent calculations.

These changes ensure that the function handles numerical precision issues gracefully and adheres to the problem constraints, thus preventing the `ValueError` and allowing the inverse kinematics solution to be computed correctly.
