To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Define Transformation Matrices:**
   Using the DH parameters, define the transformation matrices for each joint.

2. **Compute Total Transformation:**
   Multiply the individual transformation matrices to get the total transformation from the base to the TCP.

3. **Extract Position Components:**
   From the total transformation matrix, extract the x, y, z components of the TCP position.

4. **Set Up Equations:**
   Set the derived position components equal to the desired position and solve for the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

5. **Solve Using SymPy:**
   Use SymPy to solve the system of equations for θ2 and θ3 after determining θ1.

Here's the completed code implementing the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Solves for the joint angles needed to reach the position p using inverse kinematics.
    :param p: The desired position [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of joint angles (θ1, θ1, θ3) in radians.
    """
    
    # Unpack the desired position
    x_des, y_des, z_des = p
    
    # Using the inverse kinematics equations derived:
    # Equation 1: θ1 = arctan2(y_des, x_des)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y_des, x_des)
    
    # Define symbolic variables for θ2 and θ3
    theta2, theta3 = symbols('theta2 theta3')
    
    # Set up the equations based on the kinematic model
    # These equations are derived from the forward kinematics
    eq1 = Eq(x_des, some_expression_involving_theta2_and_theta3)
    eq2 = Eq(y_des, another_expression_involving_theta2_and_theta3)
    eq3 = Eq(z_des, yet_another_expression_involving_theta2_and_theta3)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (theta2, theta3))
    
    # Extract the solutions
    theta2_val = solution[theta2]
    theta3_val = solution[theta3]
    
    return (theta1, theta2_val, theta3_val)
```

Note: The `some_expression_involving_theta2_and_theta3` placeholders should be replaced with the actual expressions derived from the forward kinematics transformation matrices. This involves substituting the joint angles into the transformation matrices and equating the resulting position components to the desired position.

This approach uses SymPy to handle the symbolic mathematics and solve the system of equations for θ2 and θ3 after determining θ1 using basic trigonometry. This method ensures an analytical solution without resorting to numerical methods, providing an accurate and efficient solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
