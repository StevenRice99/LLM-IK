To address the issues in theinverse kinematics solution, we need to refine the approach by accurately modeling the robot's geometry and correctly deriving the joint angles. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the improved solution:

### Improved Approach

1. **Accurate Geometric Model**:
   - Ensure all link lengths and offsets are correctly represented in the code. This includes the positions and orientations of each link as specified in the problem details.

2. **Correct Joint Axis Consideration**:
   - Account for the axes of rotation (Z, Y, Y) for each joint to accurately compute the joint angles.

3. **Robust Calculation of `q2`**:
   - Use the correct link lengths to compute `q2` and clamp `cos_q2` within the valid range to prevent domain errors.

4. **Accurate System of Equations for `q1`**:
   - Derive the system of equations based on the robot's geometry to solve for `cos_q1` and `sin_q1`, ensuring numerical stability.

5. **Consider TCP Orientation**:
   - Although the problem focuses on position, ensure that `q3` is correctly set if orientation becomes a factor in future enhancements.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets based on the problem details
    link2_offset = 0.13585  # Offset of link 2 from joint 2
    link3_offset = 0.1197   # Offset of link 3 from joint 3
    tcp_offset = 0.39225    # Offset of TCP from joint 3

    # Calculate q2 based on the z-coordinate
    z_target = z - 0.425  # Adjust z by the base height
    cos_q2 = z_target / tcp_offset

    # Clamp cos_q2 to prevent domain errors
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)
    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)
    sin_q2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_q2 ** 2)  # sin_q2 is non-negative as q2 is in [0, Ï€]

    # Calculate B
    B = tcp_offset * sin_q2

    # Calculate A using link offsets
    A = link2_offset + link3_offset

    # Calculate determinant
    det = B ** 2 - A ** 2

    if det == 0:
        # This case should not occur as per problem statement
        q1 = 0.0
    else:
        # Solve for cos_q1 and sin_q1
        cos_q1 = (B * x - A * y) / det
        sin_q1 = (-A * x - B * y) / det

        # Clamp values to handle floating point errors
        cos_q1 = max(min(cos_q1, 1.0), -1.0)
        sin_q1 = max(min(sin_q1, 1.0), -1.0)

        q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)

    # Set q3 to 0 as orientation is not specified
    q3 = 0.0

    return (q1, q2, q3)
```

### Explanation

- **Geometric Model**: The link lengths and offsets are accurately represented to ensure correct calculations.
- **Joint Axis Consideration**: The axes of rotation are implicitly considered through the geometric model and equations.
- **Robust `q2` Calculation**: Clamping `cos_q2` ensures that the `math.acos` function receives valid inputs, preventing domain errors.
- **Accurate System of Equations**: The system of equations for `cos_q1` and `sin_q1` is derived based on the robot's geometry, ensuring accurate computation of `q1`.
- **Numerical Stability**: Clamping of `cos_q1` and `sin_q1` ensures that these values remain within valid ranges, preventing invalid calculations.

This improved approach addresses the issues identified in the feedback, providing a more accurate and robust solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the given robot arm.
