To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator efficiently without timing out, we can derive a closed-form analytical solution by leveraging the robot's structure and geometric relationships. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Define the Joint Variables and Transformation Matrices

1. **Joint Variables**: Represent the joint angles as symbols using SymPy.
2. **Transformation Matrices**: Construct the transformation matrices for each joint using the DH parameters provided.

### Step 2: Compute the Total Transformation Matrix

Multiply the individual transformation matrices to obtain the total transformation from the base to the TCP.

### Step 3: Extract Translation Components

From the total transformation matrix, extract the translation components (x, y, z) which represent the TCP position.

### Step 4: Set Up Equations

Set the extracted translation components equal to the desired position \( p \) to form three equations.

### Step 5: Solve the System of Equations

Use SymPy's `solve` function to find the joint angles \( q1, q2, q3 \) that satisfy the equations.

### Step 6: Return the Solution

Return the solution as a tuple of floats representing the required joint angles.

### Solution Code

```python
import numpy as np
import sympy as sp

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".

    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    q1, q2, q3 = sp.symbols('q1 q2 q3')
    
    # Define the transformation matrices

    T0_1 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(q1), -sp.sin(q1), 0, 0],

    ])
    
    # T3_TCP: Joint 3 to TCP (translation along Z-axis)
    T3_TCP = sp.Matrix([

        [0, 0, 1, 0.39225],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]

    # Compute the total transformation from base to TCP
    T0_TCP = T0_1 * T1_2 * T2_3 * T3_TCP
    
    # Extract the translation components (x, y, z)
    x = T0_TCP[0, 3]
    y = T0_TCP[1, 3]
    z = T0_TCP[2, 3]
    
    # Set up the equations: extracted positions equal to desired position p
    eq1 = sp.Eq(x, p[0])
    eq2 = sp.Eq(y, p[1])

    # Solve the system of equations for q1, q2, q3

### Explanation

1. **Transformation Matrices**: Each joint's transformation matrix is constructed based on its type (revolute) and the provided DH parameters, including positions and orientations.
2. **Total Transformation**: By multiplying these matrices, we obtain the total transformation from the base to the TCP, allowing us to express the TCP position in terms of the joint angles.
3. **Equation Setup**: The translation components from the total transformation matrix are set equal to the desired TCP position, forming a system of equations.
4. **Solving the System**: Using SymPy's `solve` function, we find the joint angles that satisfy these equations, ensuring an analytical solution without resorting to iterative methods.

This approach efficiently computes the required joint angles for any reachable TCP position, adhering to the constraints and avoiding numerical methods that could lead to timeouts.
