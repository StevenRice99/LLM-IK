To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator efficiently, we can follow a structured approach using analytical methods. Here's a step-by-step explanation and the final code implementation:

### Approach

1. **Define Joint Variables**: Represent the joint angles as symbols using SymPy to facilitate symbolic computation.
2. **Construct Transformation Matrices**: Build the transformation matrices for each joint based on the provided DH parameters. These matrices account for rotations and translations between consecutive joints.
3. **Compute Total Transformation**: Multiply the individual transformation matrices to obtain the total transformation from the base to the TCP.
4. **Extract Translation Components**: From the total transformation matrix, extract the translation components (x, y, z) which represent the TCP position.
5. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the extracted translation components to the desired TCP position to form a system of equations.
6. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy's `solve` function to find the joint angles that satisfy these equations, ensuring an analytical solution without iterative methods.
7. **Return the Solution**: Convert the symbolic solution to floats and return it as a tuple representing the required joint angles.

### Solution Code

```python
import numpy as np
import sympy as sp

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    q1, q2, q3 = sp.symbols('q1 q2 q3')
    
    # Define the transformation matrices
    # T0_1: Base to Joint 1 (Z-axis rotation)
    T0_1 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(q1), -sp.sin(q1), 0, 0],
        [sp.sin(q1), sp.cos(q1), 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # T1_2: Joint 1 to Joint 2 (Y-axis rotation with translation)
    T1_2 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(q2), 0, sp.sin(q2), 0.13585 * sp.cos(q2)],
        [sp.sin(q2), 0, -sp.cos(q2), 0.13585 * sp.sin(q2)],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])

        [sp.cos(q3), 0, sp.sin(q3), -0.1197 * sp.cos(q3)],
        [sp.sin(q3), 0, -sp.cos(q3), -0.1197 * sp.sin(q3)],
        [0, 1, 0, 0.425],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # T3_TCP: Joint 3 to TCP (translation along Z-axis)
    T3_TCP = sp.Matrix([
        [1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0.39225],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Compute the total transformation from base to TCP
    T0_TCP = T0_1 * T1_2 * T2_3 * T3_TCP
    
    # Extract the translation components (x, y, z)
    x = T0_TCP[0, 3]
    y = T0_TCP[1, 3]
    z = T0_TCP[2, 3]
    
    # Set up the equations: extracted positions equal to desired position p
    eq1 = sp.Eq(x, p[0])
    eq2 = sp.Eq(y, p[1])
    eq3 = sp.Eq(z, p[2])
    
    # Solve the system of equations for q1, q2, q3
    solution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (q1, q2, q3))
    
    # Return the solution as a tuple of floats
    return (float(solution[q1]), float(solution[q2]), float(solution[q3]))
```

### Explanation

1. **Transformation Matrices**: Each joint's transformation matrix is constructed based on its type (revolute) and the provided DH parameters, including positions and orientations.
2. **Total Transformation**: By multiplying these matrices, we obtain the total transformation from the base to the TCP, allowing us to express the TCP position in terms of the joint angles.
3. **Equation Setup**: The translation components from the total transformation matrix are set equal to the desired TCP position, forming a system of equations.
4. **Solving the System**: Using SymPy's `solve` function, we find the joint angles that satisfy these equations, ensuring an analytical solution without resorting to iterative methods.
5. **Efficiency**: This approach efficiently computes the required joint angles for any reachable TCP position, adhering to the constraints and avoiding numerical methods that could lead to timeouts.

This method provides a robust and efficient solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator.
