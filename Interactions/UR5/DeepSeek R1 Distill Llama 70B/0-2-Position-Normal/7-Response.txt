To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates [x, y, z]. The approach involves using geometric relationships and trigonometric identities to express the joint angles in terms of the desired position.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Kinematics**: The robot has three revolute joints with known link lengths and orientations. The goal is to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired coordinates.

2. **Set Up Equations**: Using the given link parameters, we derive the following equations based on the position of the TCP:
   - \( 0.13585 \cos(\theta1) = y + 0.1197 \)
   - \( 0.425 \cos(\theta2) = z - 0.39225 \)
   - \( 0.13585 \sin(\theta1) + 0.425 \sin(\theta2) = x \)

3. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - Compute θ1 using the arccosine of the ratio involving y.
   - Compute θ2 using the arccosine of the ratio involving z.
   - Use the Pythagorean identity to find sin(θ1) and sin(θ2).
   - Verify that the computed angles satisfy the equation for x.

4. **Return Joint Angles**: Since the orientation is not specified, θ3 is set to zero.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    a = 0.13585  # Length of the second link
    b = 0.425    # Length of the third link
    c = 0.1197    # Offset of the second link
    d = 0.39225   # Offset of the TCP

    try:
        # Calculate theta1 from the y-component
        cos_theta1 = (y + c) / a
        if cos_theta1 < -1.0 or cos_theta1 > 1.0:
            raise ValueError("The target position is not reachable with the given configuration.")
        theta1 = math.acos(cos_theta1)
        sin_theta1 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta1 ** 2)

        # Calculate theta2 from the z-component
        cos_theta2 = (z - d) / b
        if cos_theta2 < -1.0 or cos_theta2 > 1.0:
            raise ValueError("The target position is not reachable with the given configuration.")
        theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
        sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)

        # Verify the x-component
        x_calculated = a * sin_theta1 + b * sin_theta2
        if not math.isclose(x_calculated, x, rel_tol=1e-9):
            raise ValueError("The target position is not reachable with the given configuration.")

        # Theta3 is set to 0 as it doesn't affect the position
        theta3 = 0.0

        return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

### Explanation
- **Deriving Joint Angles**: The joint angles θ1 and θ2 are derived using the arccosine function based on the y and z components of the desired position. The sine components are calculated using the Pythagorean identity to ensure consistency.
- **Verification**: The calculated sine components are used to verify the x component of the position, ensuring that the derived angles are correct.
- **Error Handling**: The code includes checks to prevent domain errors in the `math.acos()` function and verifies if the target position is reachable. If any condition fails, a meaningful error message is provided.

This approach efficiently computes the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, leveraging geometric relationships and trigonometric functions for an analytical solution.
