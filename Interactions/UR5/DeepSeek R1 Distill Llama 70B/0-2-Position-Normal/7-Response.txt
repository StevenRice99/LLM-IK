To address the issues in theinitial solution, we need to revise the inverse kinematics approach to correctly account for all three joints and ensure accurate calculations. Here's the improved solution:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has three revolute joints with known link lengths and offsets. The TCP's position is determined by the joint angles.

2. **Derive Forward Kinematics Equations**: Express the TCP's position in terms of the joint angles using trigonometric identities.

3. **Set Up Inverse Kinematics Equations**: Using the derived forward kinematics, set up equations to solve for the joint angles given a desired TCP position.

4. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use algebraic manipulation and trigonometric identities to solve for the joint angles, ensuring all three joints are considered.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
        
    Returns:
        A tuple (q1, q2, q3) of joint angles in radians.
    """
    A = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    B = -0.1197  # Length of link 2
    p_x, p_y, p_z = p  # Target position
    
    # Calculate the magnitude squared of the target position in the x-y plane
    mag_sq = p_x ** 2 + p_y ** 2
    
    # Compute cos(q2) using the derived formula
    numerator = mag_sq - (A ** 2 + B ** 2)
    denominator = 2 * A * B
    cos_q2 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure cos_q2 is within valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)
    
    # Calculate q1 using the arctangent method, considering the correct quadrant
    target_angle = math.atan2(p_y, p_x)
    angle_offset = math.atan2(B, A)
    q1 = target_angle - angle_offset
    
    # Calculate q3 based on the z-position
    q3 = math.asin((p_z - 0.425) / 0.39225)
    
    return (q1, q2, q3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Problem Setup**: The function `inverse_kinematics` takes a target position `p` and returns the joint angles `(q1, q2, q3)` needed to reach that position.

2. **Constants**: The lengths of the links `A` and `B` are defined based on the robot's structure.

3. **Magnitude Calculation**: The squared magnitude of the target position in the x-y plane is computed to simplify the equations.

4. **Cosine of q2**: Using the derived formula, `cos_q2` is calculated to determine the angle `q2`.

5. **Arctangent for q1**: The angle `q1` is found using the arctangent of the target position, adjusted by an offset based on the link lengths, ensuring the correct quadrant is considered.

6. **q3 Calculation**: The angle `q3` is determined using the arcsine function to account for the z-position, ensuring the TCP reaches the correct height.

This revised approach correctly accounts for all three joints and their contributions to the TCP's position, providing accurate joint angles for the desired target position.
