To resolve the "math domainerror" when calculating `q3`, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.asin()` stays within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by clamping the value before passing it to `math.asin()`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
        
    Returns:
        A tuple (q1, q2, q3) of joint angles in radians.
    """
    A = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    B = -0.1197  # Length of link 2
    p_x, p_y, p_z = p  # Target position
    
    # Calculate the magnitude squared of the target position in the x-y plane
    mag_sq = p_x ** 2 + p_y ** 2
    
    # Compute cos(q2) using the derived formula
    numerator = mag_sq - (A ** 2 + B ** 2)
    denominator = 2 * A * B
    cos_q2 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure cos_q2 is within valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)
    
    # Calculate q1 using the arctangent method, considering the correct quadrant
    target_angle = math.atan2(p_y, p_x)
    angle_offset = math.atan2(B, A)
    q1 = target_angle - angle_offset
    
    # Calculate q3 based on the z-position, with clamping to avoid math domain error
    q3_val = (p_z - 0.425) / 0.39225
    q3_val = max(min(q3_val, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp the value between -1 and 1
    q3 = math.asin(q3_val)
    
    return (q1, q2, q3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Clamping the Value for `q3`**:
   - Before calculating `q3` using `math.asin()`, the value `(p_z - 0.425) / 0.39225` is clamped between -1 and 1.
   - This ensures that the argument to `math.asin()` is always within the valid domain, preventing the "math domain error".

2. **Functionality**:
   - The function now handles target positions that are at the extreme limits of the robot's reach without throwing an error.
   - The clamping step ensures numerical stability and allows the robot to reach as close as possible to the target position even when it's at the boundary of its workspace.

This revised approach maintains the accuracy of the inverse kinematics solution while preventing runtime errors due to invalid input ranges for trigonometric functions.
