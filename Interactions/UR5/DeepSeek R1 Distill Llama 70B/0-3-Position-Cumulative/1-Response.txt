To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we'll extend the existing solutions for subsets of the problem to include all four joints. The approach involves calculating each joint angle step by step, considering the geometric relationships and contributions of each joint to the TCP's position.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate theta1 (Joint 1):**  
   Theta1 is determined by the direction of the target position in the xy-plane. Using the arctangent of y over x gives the initial orientation of the base.

   ```python
   theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
   ```

2. **Adjust the target position relative to Joint 1:**  
   After setting theta1, the target position is adjusted to the new coordinate system.

3. **Calculate theta2 and theta3 (Joints 2 and 3):**  
   Using the adjusted target position, apply the law of cosines to solve for theta2 and theta3. This involves solving the equations derived from the geometric configuration of links 2 and 3.

4. **Calculate theta4 (Joint 4):**  
   Finally, determine theta4 based on the remaining distance to the target, ensuring the TCP reaches the exact position.

Here's the complete Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p for a 4-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of four floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, theta3, and theta4.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the direction in the xy-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Adjust the target position based on theta1
    adjusted_x = x - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    # Considering the lengths and offsets of links 2 and 3
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = math.sqrt(adjusted_x**2 + adjusted_z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3
    theta2 = math.acos((a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c))
    theta3 = math.acos((a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b))
    
    # Calculate theta4 based on the remaining position
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - (theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates each joint angle step by step, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position by considering the geometric contributions of each joint.
