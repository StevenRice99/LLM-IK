To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will move the Tool Center Point (TCP) to a specified position in 3D space. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### Step 1: Calculate Theta1 (Joint 1)
Theta1 is determined by the direction of the target position in the XY-plane. Using the arctangent of Y over X gives the initial orientation of the base.

```python
theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
```

### Step 2: Adjust the Target Position Based on Theta1
After setting Theta1, adjust the target position to account for the rotation of the first joint.

```python
adjusted_x = x - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
adjusted_z = z - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
```

### Step 3: Solve for Theta2 and Theta3 (Joints 2 and 3)
Using the adjusted target position, apply the law of cosines to solve for Theta2 and Theta3. This involves setting up the equations based on the geometric configuration of links 2 and 3.

```python
a = 0.425  # Length of link 2
b = 0.39225 # Length of link 3
c = math.sqrt(adjusted_x**2 + adjusted_z**2)

# Using the law of cosines to find Theta2 and Theta3
theta2 = math.acos((a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c))
theta3 = math.acos((a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b))
```

### Step 4: Calculate Theta4 (Joint 4)
Finally, determine Theta4 based on the remaining distance to the target, ensuring the TCP reaches the exact position.

```python
theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - (theta2 + theta3)
```

### Complete Python Function
Here's the complete Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p for a 4-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of four floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, theta3, and theta4.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the direction in the xy-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Adjust the target position based on theta1
    adjusted_x = x - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    # Considering the lengths and offsets of links 2 and 3
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = math.sqrt(adjusted_x**2 + adjusted_z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3
    theta2 = math.acos((a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c))
    theta3 = math.acos((a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b))
    
    # Calculate theta4 based on the remaining position
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - (theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation:** This joint angle is determined by the direction of the target in the XY-plane, ensuring the base of the manipulator orients correctly towards the target.

2. **Adjusting Target Position:** After orienting the base, the target position is adjusted to account for the rotation introduced by Theta1, simplifying the problem for the subsequent joints.

3. **Theta2 and Theta3 Calculation:** Using the law of cosines, these angles are determined based on the geometric configuration of links 2 and 3, ensuring the manipulator's elbow moves the TCP towards the target.

4. **Theta4 Calculation:** This final joint angle fine-tunes the position to ensure the TCP reaches the exact target location.

This approach systematically breaks down the problem, ensuring each joint's contribution is accounted for, leading to an accurate solution for the inverse kinematics problem.
