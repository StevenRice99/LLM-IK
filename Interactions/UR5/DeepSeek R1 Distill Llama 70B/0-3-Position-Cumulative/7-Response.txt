To resolve the "math domainerror" in the inverse kinematics calculation, we need to ensure that the arguments passed to the `math.acos` function stay within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by adding checks and clamping the values to prevent invalid inputs.

Here's the modified Python function with the necessary adjustments:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p for a 4-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of four floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, theta3, and theta4.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the direction in the xy-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Adjust the target position based on theta1
    adjusted_x = x - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    # Considering the lengths and offsets of links 2 and 3
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = math.sqrt(adjusted_x**2 + adjusted_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the argument for acos, ensuring it stays within valid range
    acos_arg_theta2 = (a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c)
    # Clamp the value to the valid range for acos
    acos_arg_theta2 = max(min(acos_arg_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(acos_arg_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the argument for theta3 and clamp it
    acos_arg_theta3 = (a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b)
    acos_arg_theta3 = max(min(acos_arg_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(acos_arg_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta4 based on the remaining position
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - (theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Clamping the Argument for `math.acos`:**
   - Before computing `theta2` and `theta3`, the arguments passed to `math.acos` are calculated and stored in `acos_arg_theta2` and `acos_arg_theta3`, respectively.
   - These values are then clamped to ensure they lie within the valid range of [-1, 1] using `max(min(acos_arg, 1.0), -1.0)`.
   - This prevents the "math domain error" by ensuring the input to `math.acos` is always valid.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The clamping approach handles cases where numerical precision issues might cause the argument to slightly exceed the valid range.
   - It also accommodates situations where the target position is theoretically reachable but causes minor computational inaccuracies.

By implementing these changes, the function becomes more robust and avoids the domain error, ensuring reliable calculation of the joint angles for the inverse kinematics problem.
