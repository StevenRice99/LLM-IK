To address the issues in theinverse kinematics function, we'll implement the following steps:

1. **Clamp the arguments for `math.acos` to prevent domain errors.**
2. **Refine the calculation of joint angles to improve accuracy.**
3. **Ensure joint angles stay within their physical limits.**

Here's the improved Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p for a 4-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of four floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, theta3, and theta4.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the direction in the xy-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Adjust the target position based on theta1
    adjusted_x = x - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    # Considering the lengths and offsets of links 2 and 3
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = math.sqrt(adjusted_x**2 + adjusted_z**2)
    
    # Calculate the argument for acos, ensuring it stays within valid range
    acos_arg_theta2 = (a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c)
    # Clamp the value to the valid range for acos
    acos_arg_theta2 = max(min(acos_arg_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(acos_arg_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the argument for theta3 and clamp it
    acos_arg_theta3 = (a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b)
    acos_arg_theta3 = max(min(acos_arg_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(acos_arg_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta4 based on the remaining position
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - (theta2 + theta3)
    
    # Ensure all joint angles are within their physical limits
    theta1 = max(min(theta1, math.pi, ), -math.pi)
    theta2 = max(min(theta2, math.pi/2, ), -math.pi/2)
    theta3 = max(min(theta3, math.pi/2, ), -math.pi/2)
    theta4 = max(min(theta4, math.pi, ), -math.pi)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Clamping `math.acos` Arguments:**
   - Before computing `theta2` and `theta3`, the arguments passed to `math.acos` are clamped to ensure they lie within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This prevents "math domain errors" and makes the function more robust against numerical precision issues.

2. **Refining Joint Angle Calculations:**
   - The calculations for `theta2` and `theta3` use the law of cosines, considering the lengths of links 2 and 3. This approach ensures that the geometric configuration is accurately represented.

3. **Ensuring Joint Limits:**
   - After calculating each joint angle, the values are clamped to their respective physical limits. This ensures that the calculated angles are within the manipulator's operational range, improving the function's accuracy and preventing invalid joint configurations.

By implementing these changes, the function becomes more reliable and accurate in solving the inverse kinematics problem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator.
