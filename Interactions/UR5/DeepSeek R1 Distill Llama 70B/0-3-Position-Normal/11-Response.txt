To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator efficiently, follow these steps:

1. **Define Transformation Matrices:**
   - Use the DH parameters to define the transformation matrices for each joint. This involves calculating the rotation and translation components based on the joint angles and link dimensions.

2. **Compute Total Transformation:**
   - Multiply the individual transformation matrices to obtain the total transformation from the base to the TCP. This gives the position and orientation of the TCP in terms of the joint angles.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Extract the translation part of the total transformation matrix to get the TCP position. Set these equal to the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) to form a system of equations.

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Use SymPy to solve the system of equations symbolically for the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \). Ensure the solution is analytical to avoid iterative methods.

5. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Translate the derived equations into Python code using SymPy for symbolic computation. Optimize the code to handle the equations efficiently and avoid timeouts.

By following these steps, you can achieve an efficient and accurate analytical solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the given manipulator.

```python
import sympy as sp

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4 = sp.symbols('theta1 theta2 theta3 theta4')
    
    # Define the transformation matrices using DH parameters
    T1 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(theta1), -sp.sin(theta1), 0, 0],
        [sp.sin(theta1), sp.cos(theta1), 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    T2 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(theta2 + sp.pi/2), 0, sp.sin(theta2 + sp.pi/2), 0.13585*sp.cos(theta2 + sp.pi/2)],
        [sp.sin(theta2 + sp.pi/2), 0, -sp.cos(theta2 + sp.pi/2), 0.13585*sp.sin(theta2 + sp.pi/2)],
        [0, 1, 0, 0.425],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    T3 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(theta3 + sp.pi/2), 0, sp.sin(theta3 + sp.pi/2), -0.1197*sp.cos(theta3 + sp.pi/2)],
        [sp.sin(theta3 + sp.pi/2), 0, -sp.cos(theta3 + sp.pi/2), -0.1197*sp.sin(theta3 + sp.pi/2)],
        [0, 1, 0, 0.39225],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    T4 = sp.Matrix([
        [sp.cos(theta4 + sp.pi/2), 0, sp.sin(theta4 + sp.pi/2), 0],
        [sp.sin(theta4 + sp.pi/2), 0, -sp.cos(theta4 + sp.pi/2), 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0.81725],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Compute the total transformation
    T_total = T1 * T2 * T3 * T4
    
    # Extract the translation part
    x_tcp = T_total[0, 3]
    y_tcp = T_total[1, 3]
    z_tcp = T_total[2, 3]
    
    # Set up the equations
    eq1 = sp.Eq(x_tcp, p[0])
    eq2 = sp.Eq(y_tcp, p[1])
    eq3 = sp.Eq(z_tcp, p[2])
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4))
    
    # Return the joint angles in radians
    return (float(solution[theta1]), float(solution[theta2]), float(solution[theta3]), float(solution[theta4]))
```

This code defines the transformation matrices for each joint, computes the total transformation, and solves the resulting system of equations using SymPy to find the joint angles needed to reach the desired TCP position. The solution is analytical, avoiding iterative or numeric solvers, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.
