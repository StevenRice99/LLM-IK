To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Kinematic Chain**: 
   - The robot has four revolute joints with known link parameters. Each joint's position and orientation are relative to its parent link.

2. **Express Forward Kinematics**:
   - Use the joint angles to express the transformation matrices from the base to each link and finally to the TCP. This gives the position and orientation of the TCP in terms of the joint angles.

3. **Set Up Equations**:
   - Equate the forward kinematics expressions to the desired TCP pose, resulting in a system of equations relating the joint angles to the target position and orientation.

4. **Solve the System of Equations**:
   - Use algebraic methods or numerical techniques to solve for the joint angles that satisfy the equations. This may involve using tools like SymPy for symbolic solutions or numerical methods for iterative approaches.

5. **Implement and Test**:
   - Implement the solution in code, ensuring that the joint angles are within their specified limits. Test the solution with the provided test cases to verify correctness and adjust as necessary.

By following this structured approach, we can develop an accurate inverse kinematics solution for the 4-DOF manipulator.
