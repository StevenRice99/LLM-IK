To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we follow a systematic approach to determine the joint angles that achieve the desired TCP position and orientation. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Define the DH Parameters
We start by defining the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters for each joint based on the provided details:

| Joint | a (m)      | α (rad) | d (m)      | θ (rad) |
|-------|------------|---------|------------|---------|
| 1     | 0          | 0       | 0          | q1      |
| 2     | 0.13585   | π/2     | 0          | q2      |
| 3     | -0.1197   | π       | 0.425      | q3      |
| 4     | 0          | π       | 0.39225    | q4      |

### Step 2: Express the Forward Kinematics
Using the DH parameters, we express the transformation matrices for each joint and compute the overall transformation from the base to the TCP.

The transformation matrix for each joint is given by:
\[ T_i = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta_i & -\sin\theta_i \cos\alpha_i & \sin\theta_i \sin\alpha_i & a_i \cos\theta_i \\ \sin\theta_i & \cos\theta_i \cos\alpha_i & -\cos\theta_i \sin\alpha_i & a_i \sin\theta_i \\ 0 & \sin\alpha_i & \cos\alpha_i & d_i \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

The overall transformation matrix \( T \) is:
\[ T = T_1 T_2 T_3 T_4 \]

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles
We solve for the joint angles \( q1, q2, q3, q4 \) by equating the desired transformation matrix \( T_{desired} \) to the computed transformation matrix \( T \).

#### a. Solve for \( q3 \) and \( q4 \) using the z-position and pitch:
1. **z-position equation:**
\[ z = 0.425 \cos(q3) + 0.39225 \cos(q4) \]
2. **Pitch equation:**
\[ \text{pitch} = q3 + q4 \]

From the pitch equation, express \( q4 \) in terms of \( q3 \):
\[ q4 = \text{pitch} - q3 \]

Substitute into the z-position equation:
\[ z = 0.425 \cos(q3) + 0.39225 \cos(\text{pitch} - q3) \]

Using trigonometric identities, simplify and solve for \( q3 \).

#### b. Solve for \( q2 \) using the x and y positions:
Using the solved \( q3 \), express the x and y positions:
\[ x = 0.13585 \cos(q2) - 0.1197 \cos(q3) \]
\[ y = 0.13585 \sin(q2) - 0.1197 \sin(q3) \]

Solve these equations for \( q2 \).

#### c. Solve for \( q1 \) using the roll and yaw:
The roll is directly influenced by \( q1 \), and yaw adjustments are made based on the desired orientation.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution in Code
Implement the above steps in the `inverse_kinematics` function to compute the joint angles.

### Final Answer
The inverse kinematics solution involves systematically solving for each joint angle based on the desired TCP position and orientation, leveraging the robot's structure and DH parameters. The provided code outlines this approach, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired pose.
