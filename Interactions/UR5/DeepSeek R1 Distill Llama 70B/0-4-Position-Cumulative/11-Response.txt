To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 5-degree-of-freedom robot arm, we'll break down the problem into manageable steps, solving for each joint angle sequentially. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Calculate Theta1 (Joint 1):**
   - Use the arctangent of the target's y and x coordinates to determine the angle for the first joint.
   - Adjust the target position by rotating it back by Theta1 to prepare for the next joint calculation.

2. **Calculate Theta2 (Joint 2):**
   - Using the adjusted target position, calculate Theta2 based on the z-coordinate and the known link lengths.
   - Adjust the target position again by rotating it back by Theta2.

3. **Calculate Theta3 (Joint 3):**
   - With the target position adjusted for the first two joints, solve for Theta3 using the remaining z-coordinate and link lengths.
   - Adjust the target position by rotating it back by Theta3.

4. **Calculate Theta4 (Joint 4):**
   - Using the latest adjusted target position, determine Theta4 based on the remaining z-coordinate and link lengths.
   - Adjust the target position by rotating it back by Theta4.

5. **Calculate Theta5 (Joint 5):**
   - Finally, with the target position adjusted for the first four joints, solve for Theta5 using the remaining x and y coordinates.
   - This accounts for the final orientation needed to reach the target.

By systematically solving for each joint and adjusting the target position step by step, we ensure that each joint's contribution is correctly accounted for, leading to the accurate determination of all five joint angles required to reach the desired TCP position.
