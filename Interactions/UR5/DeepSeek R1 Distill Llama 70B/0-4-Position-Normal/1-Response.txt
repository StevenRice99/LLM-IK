To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 5-DOF robot arm, we'll derive a closed-form analytical solution using symbolic computation. The approach involves setting up the transformation matrices for each joint, multiplying them to get the end effector's position, and solving the resulting equations for the joint angles.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Joint Variables:**
   - Let θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5 be the joint angles for each revolute joint.

2. **Transformation Matrices:**
   - Each joint's transformation matrix combines rotation and translation. For revolute joints, the rotation is about the specified axis (Z for θ1 and θ5, Y for θ2, θ3, θ4).

3. **Combine Transformations:**
   - Multiply the transformation matrices from joint 1 to joint 5 to get the total transformation from the base to the TCP.

4. **Extract Position:**
   - The position of the TCP is derived from the combined transformation matrix.

5. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Equate the derived position to the target position p = (x, y, z).

6. **Solve for Joint Angles:**
   - Use SymPy to solve the system of equations for θ1 to θ5.

**Solution Code:**

```python
from sympy import symbols, sin, cos, Matrix, Eq, solve
