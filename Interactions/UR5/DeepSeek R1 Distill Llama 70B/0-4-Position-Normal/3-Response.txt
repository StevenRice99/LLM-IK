To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem efficiently, we can break it down into two parts: positioning the wrist center and orienting the TCP. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the Wrist Center Position:**
   - Subtract the TCP offset from the target position to get the desired wrist center position.

2. **Solve for the First Three Joints (θ1, θ2, θ3):**
   - Use the wrist center position to set up equations based on the forward kinematics of the first three joints.
   - Solve these equations analytically to find θ1, θ2, and θ3.

3. **Solve for the Wrist Joints (θ4, θ5):**
   - Use the orientation of the TCP to set up equations for the wrist joints.
   - Solve these equations to find θ4 and θ5.

4. **Ensure Joint Limits:**
   - Check that all joint angles are within their specified limits.

5. **Return the Joint Angles:**
   - Combine the solutions for all five joints and return them as the result.

This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and analytical, avoiding the computational complexity of solving a large system of nonlinear equations all at once.
