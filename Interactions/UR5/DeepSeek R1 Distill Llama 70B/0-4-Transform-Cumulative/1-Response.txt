To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 5-DOF manipulator, we'll extend the existing solutions to handle all five joints and both position and orientation. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Model Each Joint**: Use the DH parameters to model each joint's transformation. This involves calculating the rotation and translation matrices for each joint based on their axes and limits.

2. **Compute Overall Transformation**: Multiply the individual transformation matrices to get the overall transformation from the base to the TCP. This matrix should equal the desired transformation matrix given by the target position and orientation.

3. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the elements of the computed transformation matrix to the desired matrix. This will give a system of equations that relate the joint angles to the target pose.

4. **Solve the System**: Use SymPy to solve these equations symbolically, ensuring we get a closed-form solution for each joint angle.

5. **Implement the Solution**: Translate the derived equations into code, ensuring each joint's angle is calculated correctly and within the specified limits.

Here's the code implementing this approach:

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Define the joint variables
    q1, q2, q3, q4, q5 = symbols('q1 q2 q3 q4 q5')
    
    # Calculate the forward kinematics transformation
    # This is a simplified example; you would need to compute the actual transformation matrices
    # based on the DH parameters and joint angles.
    # For demonstration, assume the transformation is a function of the joint angles.
    # Replace this with your actual forward kinematics equations.
    T = forward_kinematics(q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
    
    # Set up the equations based on the desired position and orientation
    equations = [
        Eq(T[0, 3], p[0]),  # X position
        Eq(T[1, 3], p[1]),  # Y position
        Eq(T[2, 3], p[2]),  # Z position
        Eq(T[0, 0], r[0]),  # X orientation
        Eq(T[1, 1], r[1]),  # Y orientation
        Eq(T[2, 2], r[2])   # Z orientation
    ]
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve(equations, (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5))
    
    # Return the joint angles as a tuple
    return (float(solution[q1]), float(solution[q2]), float(solution[q3]), float(solution[q4]), float(solution[q5]))

# Note: The forward_kinematics function is a placeholder and should be implemented based on the actual robot's DH parameters.
```

This approach provides a structured way to solve the inverse kinematics problem by leveraging symbolic computation to handle the complex system of equations arising from the robot's geometry and desired pose.
