To resolve the `NameError` and correctly implement the inverse kinematics solution, we need to define the `forward_kinematics` function. This function calculates the transformation matrix from the base to the TCP based on the joint angles. Here's the corrected and complete code:

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve
import numpy as np

def forward_kinematics(q1, q2, q3, q4, q5):
    """

    :param q2: Joint 2 angle
    :param q3: Joint 3 angle
    :param q4: Joint 4 angle
    :param q5: Joint 5 angle
    :return: The 4x4 transformation matrix

        translation = np.array([
            [a, 0, d],
            [0, a, 0],
            [0, 0, a]
        ])
        
        # Combine rotation and translation
        # Note: This is a simplified version; actual DH matrix may vary based on convention
        dh = np.zeros((4, 4))
        dh[:3, :3] = rotation
        dh[:3, 3] = translation[:3, 0]

This code now includes the `forward_kinematics` function, which calculates the transformation matrix from the base to the TCP using the DH parameters. The `inverse_kinematics` function uses this to set up and solve the system of equations for the joint angles.
