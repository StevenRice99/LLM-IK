To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 5-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at a specified location and orientation. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

### Approach
1. **Define DH Parameters**: Establish the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for each joint, including link lengths, joint offsets, and orientations.
2. **Compute Transformation Matrices**: For each joint, compute the transformation matrix using the DH parameters. This involves creating rotation and translation matrices and combining them.
3. **Overall Transformation**: Multiply the individual transformation matrices to obtain the overall transformation from the base to the TCP.
4. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the elements of the computed transformation matrix to the desired transformation matrix, including both position and orientation components.
5. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy to solve the system of equations for the joint angles symbolically.
6. **Return Joint Angles**: Extract the joint angles from the solution and ensure they are within the specified limits.

### Explanation
1. **DH Parameters**: The DH parameters are defined for each joint, specifying the necessary geometric properties.
2. **Transformation Matrices**: Each joint's transformation matrix is computed using the DH parameters, combining rotation and translation components.
3. **Overall Transformation**: The product of all individual transformation matrices gives the overall transformation from the base to the TCP.
4. **Equation Setup**: The elements of the computed transformation matrix are equated to the desired position and orientation, forming a system of equations.
5. **Solving the System**: SymPy's `solve` function is used to find the joint angles that satisfy the equations, providing a closed-form solution.
6. **Joint Angles**: The solution is extracted and returned as a tuple of joint angles, ensuring they are within the specified limits.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem using analytical methods, avoiding iterative solvers and ensuring quick execution.
