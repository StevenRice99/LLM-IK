To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we will use a symbolic approach with SymPy to derive the joint angles needed to reach a specified position and orientation. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define Joint Variables**: Represent each joint angle as a symbolic variable.
2. **Express Transformations**: Write the homogeneous transformation matrices for each joint.
3. **Compute End-Effector Pose**: Multiply the transformations to get the TCP's pose in terms of the joint angles.
4. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the computed pose to the desired pose and orientation.
5. **Solve the System**: Use SymPy to solve the system of equations for the joint angles.

Here is the implementation:

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Matrix, sin, cos

def rotation_matrix(angle, axis):
    """
    Returns a rotation matrix for the given angle and axis.
    """
    if axis == 'x':
        return Matrix([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, cos(angle), -sin(angle)],
            [0, sin(angle), cos(angle)]
        ])
    elif axis == 'y':
        return Matrix([
            [cos(angle), 0, sin(angle)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-sin(angle), 0, cos(angle)]
        ])
    elif axis == 'z':
        return Matrix([
            [cos(angle), -sin(angle), 0],
            [sin(angle), cos(angle), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid rotation axis")

This function uses symbolic mathematics to derive the joint angles needed to reach the desired pose. It sets up the transformation matrices for each joint, computes the end-effector's pose, and solves the resulting system of equations to find the joint angles. The solution is returned as a tuple of joint values.
