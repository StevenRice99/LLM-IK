To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to correctly model the robot's transformations and solve for the joint angles that achieve the desired TCP pose. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Define Homogeneous Transformation Matrices**: Each joint's transformation includes both rotation and translation. The rotation part is determined by the joint's axis, and the translation is based on the link's offset.

2. **Compute Total Transformation**: Multiply the individual joint transformations in the correct order to get the total transformation from the base to the TCP.

3. **Extract Position and Orientation**: From the total transformation matrix, extract the position (translation) and orientation (rotation).

4. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the extracted position and orientation to the desired values.

5. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy to solve for the joint angles.

Here is the corrected implementation:

This implementation correctly models the robot's transformations using 4x4 homogeneous matrices, including both rotation and translation for each joint. By multiplying these matrices, we obtain the total transformation from the base to the TCP. Extracting the position and orientation from this matrix allows us to set up and solve the necessary equations to find the joint angles. This approach should resolve the index error by ensuring all matrix operations are correctly dimensioned.
