To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 6-DOF serial manipulator accurately, we'll follow a systematic, geometric approach to determine each joint angle step by step. This method ensures that each joint's contribution is correctly calculated and applied, leading the TCP to reach the desired target position.

### Approach
1. **Decouple Position and Orientation**: Separate the problem into reaching the target position and achieving the desired orientation. This simplifies the calculations by handling each aspect independently.

2. **Solve for Position**:
   - **Joint 1 (Base)**: Calculate the angle based on the target's x and y components to orient the base correctly.
   - **Joint 2 (Elbow)**: Adjust the target position for Joint 1 and solve for the angle using the arccosine of the z component, ensuring the elbow moves towards the target.
   - **Joint 3 (Forearm)**: Further adjust the target position and solve for the angle using the arctangent of the adjusted x and z components, positioning the forearm correctly.

3. **Solve for Orientation**:
   - **Joint 4 (Wrist 1)**: Adjust the target for the orientation and solve using the arctangent of the y over x components to start aligning the end effector.
   - **Joint 5 (Wrist 2)**: Continue adjusting and solving to refine the orientation.
   - **Joint 6 (Wrist 3)**: Final adjustment and solving to achieve the precise orientation required.

4. **Numerical Stability**: Clamp values to prevent domain errors in trigonometric functions and ensure calculations remain within valid ranges.

### Solution Code

    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    
    # Solve for Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_d, y_d)
    
    # Adjust target for Joint 2
    x_adj = x_d - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)

    # Solve for Joint 2 with clamping to avoid domain errors

    z_adj3 = z_adj2 - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta3)
    
    # Solve for Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(y_d, x_adj3)
    
    # Adjust target for Joint 5
    x_adj4 = x_adj3 - 0.093 * math.sin(theta4)
    z_adj4 = z_adj3 - 0.093 * math.cos(theta4)
    
    # Solve for Joint 5
    theta5 = math.atan2(y_d, x_adj4)
    
    # Adjust target for Joint 6
    x_adj5 = x_adj4 - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta5)
    z_adj5 = z_adj4 - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta5)
    
    # Solve for Joint 6
    theta6 = math.atan2(y_d, x_adj5)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint 1 Calculation**: The base joint (theta1) is calculated using the arctangent of the target's x and y components. This orients the base towards the target.

2. **Joint 2 Calculation**: After adjusting the target position for Joint 1, the elbow joint (theta2) is solved using the arccosine of the adjusted z component. This lifts the arm towards the target.

3. **Joint 3 Calculation**: The forearm joint (theta3) is determined by adjusting the target position for Joint 2 and using the arctangent of the adjusted x and z components. This extends the forearm towards the target.

4. **Joints 4, 5, and 6 Calculations**: The wrist joints (theta4, theta5, theta6) are solved by iteratively adjusting the target position and using the arctangent of the y over x components. This fine-tunes the orientation of the end effector to reach the target accurately.

5. **Clamping Values**: To prevent domain errors in trigonometric functions, values are clamped within valid ranges, ensuring numerical stability.

This systematic approach ensures that each joint's contribution is accurately calculated, leading the TCP to reach the desired target position effectively.
