To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 6-DOF robot arm, we can break down the problem into manageable steps, utilizing the existing solutions for sub-chains and integrating them into a comprehensive solution. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Model Each Joint's Transformation**: Represent each revolute joint's transformation using rotation matrices and translation vectors. For a revolute joint rotating about an axis, the transformation can be expressed as a rotation followed by a translation along the joint's axis.

2. **Combine Transformations**: Multiply the transformation matrices in sequence from the base to the TCP to express the overall transformation. This gives the TCP's position and orientation in terms of the joint angles.

3. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the TCP's desired position and orientation to the expressions obtained from the combined transformations. This results in a system of equations (three for position and three for orientation) with six unknowns (joint angles).

4. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy to solve the system of equations symbolically, deriving a closed-form solution for the joint angles.

5. **Implement the Solution**: Translate the derived solution into the provided Python function, ensuring that the computed joint angles fall within the specified limits.

By following these steps, we can systematically solve the inverse kinematics problem for the 6-DOF robot arm, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the physical constraints of the robot.
