To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 6-DOF robot arm, we will follow a systematic approach that builds upon the existing solutions for sub-chains. Here's a detailed plan:

1. **Model Each Joint's Transformation**: Represent each revolute joint's transformation using rotation matrices and translation vectors. For a revolute joint rotating about an axis, the transformation can be expressed as a rotation followed by a translation along the joint's axis.

2. **Combine Transformations**: Multiply the transformation matrices in sequence from the base to the TCP to express the overall transformation. This gives the TCP's position and orientation in terms of the joint angles.

3. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the TCP's desired position and orientation to the expressions obtained from the combined transformations. This results in a system of equations (three for position and three for orientation) with six unknowns (joint angles).

4. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy to solve the system of equations symbolically, deriving a closed-form solution for the joint angles.

5. **Implement the Solution**: Translate the derived solution into the provided Python function, ensuring that the computed joint angles fall within the specified limits.

By following these steps, we can systematically solve the inverse kinematics problem for the 6-DOF robot arm, ensuring accuracy and adherence to the physical constraints of the robot.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    :param p: The desired position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of six floats representing the joint angles theta1 to theta6.
    """
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution for joints 1-2
    theta1, theta2 = existing_code_1(p)
    
    # Step 2: Using theta1 and theta2, solve for theta3 and theta4 using the existing solution for joints 3-4
    theta3, theta4 = existing_code_2(theta1, theta2, p)
    
    # Step 3: Using theta1, theta2, theta3, and theta4, solve for theta5 and theta6 using the existing solution for joints 5-6
    theta5, theta6 = existing_code_3(theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, p)
    
    # Return all six joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

This approach leverages the existing solutions for sub-chains to incrementally solve for all six joint angles, ensuring that each step builds on the previous one to reach the desired TCP position.
