To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 6-DOF robot arm, we can break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Model the Robot**: Use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters to model each link's transformation. This will help in expressing the forward kinematics equations.

2. **Set Up Equations**: Express the forward kinematics equations using the DH parameters. These equations relate the joint angles to the TCP's position and orientation.

3. **Decouple Position and Orientation**: Solve for the first three joints to achieve the desired TCP position. Then, solve for the last three joints to achieve the desired orientation.

4. **Solve the Equations**: Use algebraic methods or tools like SymPy to solve the nonlinear equations for the joint angles.

5. **Verify the Solution**: Plug the computed joint angles back into the forward kinematics to ensure the TCP reaches the desired pose.

By following these steps, we can find the joint angles needed to reach the target position and orientation.
