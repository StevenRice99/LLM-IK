To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired location. The TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane as the joint rotates around the Y-axis. Using trigonometric relationships, we derive the joint angle θ using the arctangent function based on the target's X and Z coordinates.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the joint angle needed to reach the given TCP position.
    :param p: The target position [x, y, z].
    :return: The joint angle θ in radians.
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    # Since the problem states all targets are reachable, we assume py is correct
    theta = math.atan2(px, pz)
    return theta
```
