To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired target position. The TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane due to the rotation around the Y-axis. The solution involves calculating θ using the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant based on the target's X and Z coordinates.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of x and z
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)
    return theta
```
