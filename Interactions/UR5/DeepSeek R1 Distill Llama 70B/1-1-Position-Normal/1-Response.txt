To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired coordinates. The TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane, and its position can be expressed in terms of θ. Using trigonometric relationships, we derive θ using the arctangent function, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    z_target = p[2]
    theta = math.atan2(-x_target, z_target)
    return theta
```
