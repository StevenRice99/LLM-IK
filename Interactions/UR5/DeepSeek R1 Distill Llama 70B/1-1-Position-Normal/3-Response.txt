To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 1-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired target position. The TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane, and its position can be described using trigonometric functions based on the joint angle. By using the arctangent function correctly, we can find the appropriate θ for any given target position.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    z_target = p[2]
    theta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    return theta
```
