To address the issue wherethe joint angles were incorrect by a sign, we need to adjust the calculation of the joint angle Î¸. The TCP's movement direction suggests that the joint angle should be negated to align with the correct position.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    z_target = p[2]
    theta = -math.atan2(-x_target, z_target)
    return theta
```
