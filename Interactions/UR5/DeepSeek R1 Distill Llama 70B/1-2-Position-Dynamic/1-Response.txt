To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-joint robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, z). The solution involves using geometric relationships and trigonometric identities.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Calculate Link Lengths:**
   - Compute the length of the first link (l1) as the distance between Joint 1 and Joint 2.
   - The second link length (l2) is given as the distance from Joint 2 to the TCP.

2. **Law of Cosines:**
   - Use the law of cosines to find cosθ2, where θ2 is the angle between the two links.

3. **Compute θ2:**
   - Calculate θ2 using the arccosine of the value obtained from the law of cosines.

4. **Calculate A and B:**
   - A is the sum of l1 and the projection of l2 along the direction of θ2.
   - B is the projection of l2 perpendicular to θ2.

5. **Determine θ1:**
   - Use the derived equations to find the tangent of θ1, then compute θ1 using the arctangent function, ensuring the correct quadrant.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the length of the first link
    l1 = math.sqrt(0.1197**2 + 0.425**2)  # Approximately 0.4412 meters
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link including the TCP offset
    
    # Calculate cosθ2 using the law of cosines
    numerator = x**2 + z**2 - l1**2 - l2**2
    denominator = 2 * l1 * l2
    cosθ2 = numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else 0
    
    # Clamp cosθ2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    
    # Calculate A and B
    A = l1 + l2 * cosθ2
    B = l2 * math.sin(θ2)
    
    # Calculate tanθ1
    numerator_tan = -(B * z + A * x)
    denominator_tan = A * z - B * x
    
    if denominator_tan == 0:
        # Handle division by zero, though problem states all targets are reachable
        θ1 = 0.0
    else:
        tanθ1 = numerator_tan / denominator_tan
        θ1 = math.atan2(numerator_tan, denominator_tan)  # Using arctan2 for correct quadrant
    
    return (θ1, θ2)
```

This code calculates the necessary joint angles θ1 and θ2 to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering the geometric constraints and using trigonometric identities to solve the inverse kinematics problem.
