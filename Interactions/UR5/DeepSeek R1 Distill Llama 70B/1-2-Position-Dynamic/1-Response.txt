To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, z). The solution involves solving a system of trigonometric equations derived from the forward kinematics.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define Constants:**
   - A = 0.425 m (length of the first link)
   - B = 0.39225 m (length of the second link)

2. **Compute Intermediate Values:**
   - Calculate C using the formula: \( C = \frac{x^2 + z^2 + A^2 - B^2}{2A} \)
   - Compute D as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the target: \( D = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2} \)

3. **Determine Angle φ:**
   - φ is the angle from the x-axis to the target position: \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{z}{x}\right) \)

4. **Solve for θ1:**
   - Compute \( \sin(\theta1 + \phi) = \frac{C}{D} \)
   - Find θ1 using the arcsin function, considering both possible solutions.

5. **Compute Δ (Delta):**
   - Use the law of cosines to find the angle between the two links: \( \delta = \arccos\left(\frac{x^2 + z^2 - A^2 - B^2}{2AB}\right) \)

6. **Determine θ2:**
   - θ2 is found by subtracting Δ from θ1.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225

    # Calculate C
    C = (x**2 + z**2 + A**2 - B**2) / (2 * A)
    
    # Calculate D
    D = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate phi
    if x == 0:
        phi = math.pi / 2
    else:
        phi = math.atan(z / x)
    
    # Calculate sin(theta1 + phi)
    if abs(C / D) > 1:
        # Handle unreachable, but problem states all are reachable
        pass
    sin_val = C / D
    theta1_plus_phi = math.asin(sin_val)
    
    # Two possible solutions for theta1
    theta1_sol1 = theta1_plus_phi - phi
    theta1_sol2 = math.pi - theta1_plus_phi - phi
    
    # Calculate delta using law of cosines
    cos_delta = (x**2 + z**2 - A**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * B)
    delta = math.acos(cos_delta)
    
    # Calculate theta2 for each solution
    theta2_sol1 = theta1_sol1 - delta
    theta2_sol2 = theta1_sol2 - delta
    
    # Return the first solution
    return (theta1_sol1, theta2_sol1)
```

This code calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates using an analytical approach, ensuring a closed-form solution without optimization methods.
