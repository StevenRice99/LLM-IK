To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 2-joint robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that will position the TCP at a desired (x, z) coordinate. The solution involves using geometric relationships and trigonometric identities.

### Approach
1. **Calculate Link Lengths:** Compute the lengths of the first and second links using the given positions.
2. **Calculate Distance (d):** Compute the Euclidean distance from the base to the TCP using the Pythagorean theorem.
3. **Law of Cosines for θ2:** Use the law of cosines to find the cosine of θ2.
4. **Calculate θ2:** Determine θ2 using the arccosine function.
5. **Calculate θ1:** Use the arctangent function with the correct quadrant consideration to find θ1.
6. **Return Joint Angles:** Return θ1 and θ2 as the solution.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the lengths of the links
    l1 = math.sqrt(0.1197**2 + 0.425**2)  # Approximately 0.4412 meters
    l2 = math.sqrt(0.1197**2 + (0.425 - 0.39225)**2)  # Approximately 0.1202 meters
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Apply the law of cosines to find cosθ2
    cosθ2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Clamp cosθ2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate θ2 using arccos
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    
    # Calculate θ1 using arctan2 to get the correct quadrant
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z) - θ2
    
    return (θ1, θ2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Link Lengths:** The lengths of the first and second links are calculated using the distance formula based on their respective positions.
2. **Distance Calculation:** The Euclidean distance from the base to the TCP is computed to determine the reachability.
3. **Law of Cosines:** This is used to find the cosine of θ2, which helps in determining the angle between the two links.
4. **θ2 Calculation:** The arccosine function is used to find θ2, ensuring the value is within the valid range.
5. **θ1 Calculation:** The arctangent function with two arguments (arctan2) is used to get the correct quadrant for θ1.
6. **Return Values:** The joint angles θ1 and θ2 are returned as the solution to position the TCP at the desired coordinates.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem using geometric and trigonometric principles, ensuring accurate positioning of the TCP.
