To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-joint robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, z). The solution involves using geometric relationships and trigonometric identities.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Extract Target Coordinates:**
   - Extract the x and z coordinates from the target position tuple.

2. **Calculate the Distance (d):**
   - Compute the Euclidean distance from the base to the TCP using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Define Link Lengths:**
   - The first link length (l1) is calculated as the distance between Joint 1 and Joint 2.
   - The second link length (l2) is given as the distance from Joint 2 to the TCP.

4. **Law of Cosines for θ2:**
   - Use the law of cosines to find the cosine of θ2.
   - Clamp the cosine value between -1 and 1 to avoid invalid inputs for the arccos function.

5. **Calculate θ2:**
   - Determine θ2 using the arccosine function.

6. **Calculate θ1:**
   - Find θ1 by subtracting θ2 from the angle formed by the target position vector (atan2(x, z)).

7. **Return Joint Angles:**
   - Return θ1 and θ2 as the solution.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Define the lengths of the links
    l1 = math.sqrt(0.1197**2 + 0.425**2)  # Approximately 0.4412 meters
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link including the TCP offset
    
    # Apply the law of cosines to find cosθ2
    cosθ2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Clamp cosθ2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate θ2 using arccos
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    
    # Calculate θ1 using the direction of the target position
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z) - θ2
    
    return (θ1, θ2)
```

This code calculates the necessary joint angles θ1 and θ2 to position the TCP at the desired coordinates by using the law of cosines and trigonometric identities, ensuring accurate and efficient computation.
