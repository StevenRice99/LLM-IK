To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 2-joint robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that will position the TCP at a desired (x, z) coordinate. The solution involves using geometric relationships and trigonometric identities.

### Approach
1. **Calculate the Distance (D):** Compute the Euclidean distance from the base to the TCP using the Pythagorean theorem.
2. **Law of Cosines for θ2:** Use the law of cosines to find the cosine of θ2.
3. **Calculate θ2:** Determine θ2 using the arccosine function.
4. **Define A and B:** Calculate A as the sum of the first link length (L1) and the projection of the second link length (L2) along θ2. Calculate B as the projection of L2 perpendicular to θ2.
5. **Calculate sinθ1 and cosθ1:** Use the derived equations to find the sine and cosine of θ1.
6. **Determine θ1:** Use the arctangent function to find θ1, ensuring the correct quadrant.
7. **Return Joint Angles:** Return θ1 and θ2 as the solution.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Define the lengths of the links
    l1 = math.sqrt(0.1197**2 + 0.425**2)  # Approximately 0.4412 meters
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link including the TCP offset
    
    # Apply the law of cosines to find cosθ2
    cosθ2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    
    # Clamp cosθ2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate θ2 using arccos
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    
    # Calculate A and B
    A = l1 + l2 * cosθ2
    B = l2 * math.sin(θ2)
    
    # Calculate sinθ1 and cosθ1
    numerator = B * x - A * z
    denominator = A**2 + B**2
    
    if denominator == 0:
        sinθ1 = 0.0
    else:
        sinθ1 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure sinθ1 is within valid range
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    cosθ1 = math.sqrt(1 - sinθ1**2)
    
    # Determine the correct sign for cosθ1 based on the quadrant
    if (A * x + B * z) < 0:
        cosθ1 = -cosθ1
    
    # Calculate θ1 using arctan2 to get the correct quadrant
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)
    
    return (θ1, θ2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Distance Calculation:** The distance `d` from the base to the TCP is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
2. **Law of Cosines:** This is used to find `cosθ2`, which helps in determining the angle θ2.
3. **Clamping `cosθ2`:** Ensures that the value is within the valid range for the arccos function.
4. **Calculating θ2:** Uses the arccos function to find θ2.
5. **A and B:** These are intermediate values used to simplify the equations for θ1.
6. **Sine and Cosine of θ1:** Calculated using the derived equations, ensuring the values are within valid ranges.
7. **Determining θ1:** Uses the arctangent function to find θ1, ensuring the correct quadrant based on the signs of sine and cosine.
8. **Return Values:** The function returns the joint angles θ1 and θ2 needed to position the TCP at the desired coordinates.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem using geometric and trigonometric principles, ensuring accurate positioning of the TCP.
