To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, z). The solution involves solving a system of trigonometric equations derived from the forward kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Define Constants:**
   - A = 0.425 m (length of the first link)
   - B = 0.39225 m (length of the second link)

2. **Compute Intermediate Values:**
   - Calculate D, the Euclidean distance from the origin to the target: \( D = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2} \)
   - Compute φ, the angle from the x-axis to the target position: \( \phi = \arctan(z / x) \)
   - Calculate C using the formula: \( C = \frac{x^2 + z^2 + A^2 - B^2}{2A} \)

3. **Determine Angle θ1:**
   - Compute \( \sin(\theta1 + \phi) = \frac{C}{D} \)
   - Find \( \theta1 + \phi \) using the arcsin function, considering the correct quadrant based on the signs of x and z.
   - Solve for θ1 by subtracting φ from \( \theta1 + \phi \).

4. **Compute Angle θ2:**
   - Use the law of cosines to find the angle δ between the two links: \( \delta = \arccos\left(\frac{x^2 + z^2 - A^2 - B^2}{2AB}\right) \)
   - Solve for θ2 by subtracting δ from θ1.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225

    # Calculate D
    D = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Handle the case where D is zero to avoid division by zero
    if D == 0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Calculate phi
    if x == 0:
        phi = math.pi / 2
    else:
        phi = math.atan(z / x)
    
    # Calculate C
    C = (x**2 + z**2 + A**2 - B**2) / (2 * A)
    
    # Calculate sin(theta1 + phi)
    if abs(C / D) > 1:
        # Handle unreachable, but problem states all are reachable
        pass
    sin_val = C / D
    theta1_plus_phi = math.asin(sin_val)
    
    # Determine the correct quadrant for theta1 + phi
    if x < 0 or z < 0:
        theta1_plus_phi = math.pi - theta1_plus_phi
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = theta1_plus_phi - phi
    
    # Calculate delta using the law of cosines
    cos_delta = (x**2 + z**2 - A**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * B)
    delta = math.acos(cos_delta)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = theta1 - delta
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```
