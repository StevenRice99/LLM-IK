To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, z). The solution involves solving a system of trigonometric equations derived from the forward kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Define Constants:**
   - A = 0.425 m (length of the first link)
   - B = 0.39225 m (length of the second link)

2. **Calculate θ2:**
   - Use the law of cosines to find θ2:
     \[
     \cos(\theta2) = \frac{x^2 + z^2 - A^2 - B^2}{2AB}
     \]
   - Compute θ2 using the arccos function.

3. **Calculate Intermediate Values:**
   - Compute \( C = A + B \cos(\theta2) \)
   - Compute \( D = B \sin(\theta2) \)

4. **Solve for sin(θ1) and cos(θ1):**
   - Using the equations:
     \[
     x = C \sin(\theta1) + D \cos(\theta1)
     \]
     \[
     z = D \sin(\theta1) + C \cos(\theta1)
     \]
   - Solve for \( \sin(\theta1) \) and \( \cos(\theta1) \) using algebraic manipulation.

5. **Determine θ1:**
   - Use the arctangent function to find θ1 from \( \sin(\theta1) \) and \( \cos(\theta1) \).

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225

    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (x**2 + z**2 - A**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * B)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Calculate C and D
    C = A + B * math.cos(theta2)
    D = B * math.sin(theta2)

    # Solve for sin(theta1) and cos(theta1)
    # Using the equations:
    # x = C * sin(theta1) + D * cos(theta1)
    # z = D * sin(theta1) + C * cos(theta1)
    # Solving for sin(theta1) and cos(theta1)

    # Calculate sin(theta1)
    numerator_sin = z * D - C * x
    denominator_sin = D**2 - C**2
    sin_theta1 = numerator_sin / denominator_sin

    # Calculate cos(theta1)
    cos_theta1 = (x - C * sin_theta1) / D

    # Ensure sin^2 + cos^2 = 1 (within a small tolerance)
    # This step is crucial for numerical stability
    norm = math.sqrt(sin_theta1**2 + cos_theta1**2)
    if not (math.isclose(norm, 1.0, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9)):
        raise ValueError("The target position is not reachable.")

    sin_theta1 /= norm
    cos_theta1 /= norm

    # Calculate theta1 using arctan2
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```
