To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we can use a combination of geometric and algebraic methods. The approach involves solving the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics to find the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired target.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The goal is to find the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) that position the TCP at a given (x, z) coordinate.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: The position of the TCP is given by:
   - \( x = A \sin(\theta1) + B \sin(\theta2) \)
   - \( z = A \cos(\theta1) + B \cos(\theta2) \)
   where \( A = 0.425 \) and \( B = 0.39225 \).

3. **Geometric Insight**: By squaring and adding the equations, we derive:
   - \( x^2 + z^2 = A^2 + B^2 + 2AB \cos(\theta1 - \theta2) \)
   Using the law of cosines, we find the angle difference \( \theta1 - \theta2 \).

4. **Solving for Joint Angles**:
   - Compute intermediate values to express the equations in terms of a single angle.
   - Use trigonometric identities to solve for θ1 and subsequently θ2.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225

    # Calculate C
    C = x**2 + z**2 + A**2 - B**2

    # Calculate D
    D = C / (2 * A)

    # Calculate E
    E = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    # Calculate phi
    phi = math.atan2(z, x)

    # Calculate theta1
    if abs(D) > E:
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        theta1 = phi - math.acos(D / E)

    # Calculate sin(theta2) and cos(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = (x - A * math.sin(theta1)) / B
    cos_theta2 = (z - A * math.cos(theta1)) / B

    # Ensure sin_theta2 and cos_theta2 are within valid range
    sin_theta2 = max(min(sin_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Intermediate Calculations**: Compute intermediate values (C, D, E) to simplify the equations.
2. **Angle Calculation**: Use trigonometric identities to solve for θ1 and θ2.
3. **Validation**: Ensure the computed sine and cosine values for θ2 are within valid ranges to avoid invalid results.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem using geometric and algebraic methods, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.
