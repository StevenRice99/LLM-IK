To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles required to reach a specified target position. The approach involves projecting the target onto the X-Z plane and using geometric methods to find the necessary angles.

### Approach
1. **Projection onto X-Z Plane**: Since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, we can ignore the Y-coordinate of the target position.
2. **Calculate Distance**: Compute the distance from the origin to the projected target point using the Pythagorean theorem.
3. **Determine First Joint Angle (theta1)**: Use the arctangent function to find the angle of the first joint from the Z-axis.
4. **Determine Second Joint Angle (theta2)**: Apply the law of cosines to find the angle between the two links based on their lengths and the distance to the target.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Project the target position onto the X-Z plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    if d == 0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Calculate the first joint angle theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Define the lengths of the links
    a1 = 0.434  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    a2 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Apply the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (a1**2 + a2**2 - d**2) / (2 * a1 * a2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Projection and Distance Calculation**: The target position is projected onto the X-Z plane to simplify the problem into two dimensions. The distance from the origin to this projected point is calculated.
2. **First Joint Angle (theta1)**: This angle is determined using `atan2` to find the direction from the origin to the projected target point.
3. **Second Joint Angle (theta2)**: Using the law of cosines, the angle between the two links is calculated based on their lengths and the distance to the target. This ensures the arm can reach the desired position.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem for a 2-link robot arm, providing the necessary joint angles to reach any given target position within the arm's workspace.
