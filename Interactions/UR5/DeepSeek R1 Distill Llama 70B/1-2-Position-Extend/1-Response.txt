To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we can use the following approach:

1. **Model the Forward Kinematics**: Represent the position of the TCP using the joint angles theta1 and theta2.
2. **Set Up Equations**: Derive equations based on the desired TCP position and solve for the joint angles.
3. **Use Geometric Relationships**: Apply the law of cosines and trigonometric identities to find possible solutions.
4. **Check Joint Limits**: Ensure the computed joint angles are within the specified limits.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Define the lengths of the links based on the provided details
    l1 = 0.4412  # Distance from base to first joint
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    x = x_target
    z = z_target

    # Calculate K
    K = (x**2 + z**2 + l2**2 - l1**2) / (2 * l2)

    # Calculate A, B, and C
    A = x
    B = z
    C = math.sqrt(A**2 + B**2)

    # Handle the case where C is zero to avoid division by zero
    if C == 0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)

    # Calculate phi
    phi = math.atan2(B, A)

    # Calculate the possible theta values
    theta_candidates = []
    if abs(K / C) <= 1:
        theta1 = phi + math.acos(K / C)
        theta2 = phi - math.acos(K / C)
        theta_candidates.append(theta1)
        theta_candidates.append(theta2)

    solutions = []
    for theta in theta_candidates:
        # Calculate cos(theta1) and sin(theta1)
        cos_theta1 = (x - l2 * math.cos(theta)) / l1
        sin_theta1 = (z - l2 * math.sin(theta)) / l1

        # Check if the calculated values are valid
        if abs(cos_theta1**2 + sin_theta1**2 - 1) > 1e-6:
            continue

        # Calculate theta1
        angle1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

        # Calculate theta2
        angle2 = theta - angle1

        # Check if the angles are within the joint limits
        if (-6.2831853 <= angle1 <= 6.2831853) and (-6.2831853 <= angle2 <= 6.2831853):
            solutions.append((angle1, angle2))

    if solutions:
        return solutions[0]
    else:
        # According to the problem statement, all targets are reachable, so this should not occur
        return (0.0, 0.0)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach a given target position, considering the geometric constraints and joint limits of the manipulator.
