To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we can use a geometric approach based on the law of cosines. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. **Calculate the Distance to the Target**: Compute the distance \( D \) from the base of the manipulator to the target position using the Pythagorean theorem.

2. **Apply the Law of Cosines**: Use the law of cosines to find the sum of the joint angles \( \phi = \theta_1 + \theta_2 \).

3. **Solve for Individual Joint Angles**: Use the original equations derived from the forward kinematics to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) individually.

4. **Check Joint Limits**: Ensure that the computed joint angles are within the specified limits.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Define the lengths of the links based on the provided details
    l1 = 0.425  # Distance from base to first joint
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target
    D = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)

    # Apply the law of cosines to find phi
    cos_phi = (l1**2 + l2**2 - D**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    phi = math.acos(cos_phi)

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the original equations
    # Using the first equation: -0.425 * sin(theta1) + 0.39225 * sin(theta2) = x_target
    # And the second equation: 0.425 * cos(theta1) + 0.39225 * cos(theta2) = z_target

    # Express theta2 in terms of theta1
    # theta2 = phi - theta1

    # Substitute theta2 into the equations and solve for theta1
    # This step may require iterative methods or further algebraic manipulation
    # For simplicity, we'll use an iterative approach here

    # Initialize theta1 with an initial guess
    theta1_guess = 0.0

    # Iterate to find a suitable theta1
    for _ in range(1000):
        theta2_guess = phi - theta1_guess

        # Calculate the left-hand side of the first equation
        lhs1 = -l1 * math.sin(theta1_guess) + l2 * math.sin(theta2_guess)
        # Calculate the left-hand side of the second equation
        lhs2 = l1 * math.cos(theta1_guess) + l2 * math.cos(theta2_guess)

        # Update theta1_guess based on the error
        error1 = x_target - lhs1
        error2 = z_target - lhs2

        # Simple iterative adjustment
        theta1_guess += 0.001 * (error1 + error2)

    theta2 = phi - theta1_guess

    # Check if the solutions are within the joint limits
    if (-6.2831853 <= theta1_guess <= 6.2831853) and (-6.2831853 <= theta2 <= 6.2831853):
        return (theta1_guess, theta2)
    else:
        # According to the problem statement, all targets are reachable, so this should not occur
        return (0.0, 0.0)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach a given target position by first determining the sum of the joint angles using the law of cosines and then iteratively refining the individual joint angles to satisfy the forward kinematics equations. The solution ensures that the computed angles are within the specified joint limits.
