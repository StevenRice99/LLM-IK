To address the issue withthe inverse kinematics solution, I'll implement a Jacobian-based iterative method. This approach is more robust and can handle a wider range of target positions effectively.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" using an iterative Jacobian method.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225

    # Initial guess for joint angles
    theta1 = 0.0
    theta2 = 0.0

    # Convergence parameters
    max_iterations = 1000
    error_threshold = 0.001
    damping = 0.1

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        # Compute current TCP position
        x_current = A * math.sin(theta1) + B * math.sin(theta2)
        z_current = A * math.cos(theta1) + B * math.cos(theta2)

        # Compute error
        error = math.sqrt((x_current - x_target)**2 + (z_current - z_target)**2)

        if error < error_threshold:
            break

        # Compute Jacobian matrix
        J11 = A * math.cos(theta1)
        J12 = B * math.cos(theta2)
        J21 = -A * math.sin(theta1)
        J22 = -B * math.sin(theta2)

        # Compute determinant
        det = J11 * J22 - J12 * J21

        # Damped inverse of Jacobian
        det_damped = det**2 + damping
        J_inv11 = (J22 * det_damped) / det_damped
        J_inv12 = (-J12 * det_damped) / det_damped
        J_inv21 = (-J21 * det_damped) / det_damped
        J_inv22 = (J11 * det_damped) / det_damped

        # Compute error vector
        e_x = x_target - x_current
        e_z = z_target - z_current

        # Update joint angles
        delta_theta1 = J_inv11 * e_x + J_inv12 * e_z
        delta_theta2 = J_inv21 * e_x + J_inv22 * e_z

        theta1 += delta_theta1
        theta2 += delta_theta2

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution uses an iterative approach with the Jacobian matrix to adjust the joint angles until the TCP reaches the desired position within a specified error tolerance. The damping factor helps mitigate singularities and stabilizes the convergence process.
