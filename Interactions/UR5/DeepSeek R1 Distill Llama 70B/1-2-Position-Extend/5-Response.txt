To address the inaccuraciesin the inverse kinematics solution, we need to refine the approach by accurately modeling the robot's geometry and employing a more robust method to calculate the joint angles. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the improved solution:

### Approach
1. **Model the Robot Geometry**: Accurately represent the positions and orientations of each joint and the TCP based on the provided details.
2. **Transform Coordinates**: Convert the target position into the robot's coordinate system if necessary.
3. **Calculate Joint Angles**:
   - **First Joint (theta1)**: Determine the angle needed to align the arm with the target's projection in the X-Z plane.
   - **Second Joint (theta2)**: Use vector operations to find the angle between the second link and the target position, ensuring accurate positioning in 3D space.
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure calculations remain within valid domains to prevent mathematical errors.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # The second joint's position relative to the first joint
    joint2_x, joint2_y, joint2_z = 0.0, -0.1197, 0.425
    tcp_offset_z = 0.39225  # TCP offset from the second joint
    
    # Calculate the position of the TCP relative to the first joint
    tcp_x = x - joint2_x
    tcp_y = y - joint2_y
    tcp_z = z - joint2_z - tcp_offset_z
    
    # Project onto the X-Z plane
    d = math.sqrt(tcp_x**2 + tcp_z**2)
    
    if d == 0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Calculate the first joint angle theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(tcp_x, tcp_z)
    
    # Calculate the angle for the second joint using vector approach
    # Vector from joint2 to TCP
    vector_x = tcp_x
    vector_z = tcp_z
    
    # Calculate the angle theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(vector_z, vector_z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Modeling the Geometry**: The positions of the joints and TCP are defined based on the provided details, ensuring accurate calculations.
2. **Transforming Coordinates**: The target position is adjusted relative to the first joint to simplify angle calculations.
3. **Calculating Theta1**: The first joint angle is determined using `atan2` to align the arm with the target's projection.
4. **Calculating Theta2**: Using vector operations, the second joint angle is accurately determined to reach the target in 3D space.
5. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles cases where the target is at the origin to prevent division by zero.

This refined approach ensures that the inverse kinematics solution accurately calculates the joint angles, allowing the robot arm to reach the target positions effectively.
