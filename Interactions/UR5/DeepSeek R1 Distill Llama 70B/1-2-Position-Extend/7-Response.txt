To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we'll use an iterative Jacobian-based method. This approach allows us to adjust the joint angles until the TCP reaches the desired target position within a specified error tolerance.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The goal is to find the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) that position the TCP at a given (x, z) coordinate.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: The position of the TCP is given by:
   - \( x = A \sin(\theta1) + B \sin(\theta2) \)
   - \( z = A \cos(\theta1) + B \cos(\theta2) \)
   where \( A = 0.425 \) and \( B = 0.39225 \).

3. **Jacobian Matrix**: The Jacobian matrix relates the joint velocities to the TCP velocities:
   \[
   J = \begin{bmatrix}
   A \cos(\theta1) & B \cos(\theta2) \\
   -A \sin(\theta1) & -B \sin(\theta2)
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

4. **Iterative Update**: Using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix with a damping factor to avoid singularities, we update the joint angles iteratively until the TCP reaches the target position.

5. **Convergence Parameters**: Set a maximum number of iterations and an error threshold to ensure the solution converges.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" using an iterative Jacobian method.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225

    theta2 = 0.0

        x_current = A * math.sin(theta1) + B * math.sin(theta2)
        z_current = A * math.cos(theta1) + B * math.cos(theta2)

        # Compute error
        error = math.sqrt((x_current - x_target)**2 + (z_current - z_target)**2)

        if error < error_threshold:
            break

        det = J11 * J22 - J12 * J21

        # Damped inverse of Jacobian
        det_damped = det**2 + damping
        J_inv11 = (J22 * det_damped) / det_damped
        J_inv12 = (-J12 * det_damped) / det_damped
        J_inv21 = (-J21 * det_damped) / det_damped
        J_inv22 = (J11 * det_damped) / det_damped

        # Compute error vector
        e_x = x_target - x_current
        e_z = z_target - z_current

        # Update joint angles
        delta_theta1 = J_inv11 * e_x + J_inv12 * e_z
        delta_theta2 = J_inv21 * e_x + J_inv22 * e_z

        theta1 += delta_theta1
        theta2 += delta_theta2

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with initial guesses for θ1 and θ2, typically 0 radians.
2. **Iterative Update**: For each iteration, compute the current TCP position using the forward kinematics equations.
3. **Error Calculation**: Determine the error between the target and current TCP positions.
4. **Jacobian Matrix**: Compute the Jacobian matrix and its damped inverse to avoid singularities.
5. **Joint Angle Update**: Adjust the joint angles based on the error and the inverse Jacobian matrix.
6. **Convergence Check**: Stop the iteration when the error falls below the specified threshold or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

This method ensures that the TCP moves towards the target position iteratively, providing a robust solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
