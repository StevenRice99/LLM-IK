To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom robot arm accurately, we need to employ a more precise approach that accounts for the robot's 3D geometry and uses robust mathematical methods. Here's a detailed solution:

### Approach
1. **Model the Robot Geometry**: Define the positions and orientations of each joint and the TCP based on the provided details.
2. **Transform Coordinates**: Convert the target position into the robot's coordinate system if necessary.
3. **Calculate Joint Angles**:
   - **First Joint (theta1)**: Determine the angle needed to align the arm with the target's projection in the X-Z plane, considering the TCP offset.
   - **Second Joint (theta2)**: Use vector operations and the law of cosines to find the angle between the second link and the target position, ensuring accurate positioning in 3D space.
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure calculations remain within valid domains to prevent mathematical errors.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # The second joint's position relative to the first joint
    joint2_x, joint2_y, joint2_z = 0.0, -0.1197, 0.425
    tcp_offset_z = 0.39225  # TCP offset from the second joint
    
    # Calculate the position of the TCP relative to the first joint
    tcp_x = x - joint2_x
    tcp_y = y - joint2_y
    tcp_z = z - joint2_z - tcp_offset_z
    
    # Project onto the X-Z plane
    d = math.sqrt(tcp_x**2 + tcp_z**2)
    
    if d == 0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Calculate the first joint angle theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(tcp_x, tcp_z)
    
    # Define the lengths of the links
    a1 = 0.434  # Distance from joint 1 to joint 2
    a2 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Apply the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (a1**2 + a2**2 - d**2) / (2 * a1 * a2)
    
    # Clamp the value to handle numerical precision issues
    epsilon = 1e-8
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0 - epsilon), -1.0 + epsilon)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Modeling the Geometry**: The positions of the joints and TCP are defined based on the provided details, ensuring accurate calculations.
2. **Transforming Coordinates**: The target position is adjusted relative to the first joint to simplify angle calculations.
3. **Calculating Theta1**: The first joint angle is determined using `atan2` to align the arm with the target's projection.
4. **Calculating Theta2**: Using the law of cosines, the second joint angle is accurately determined to reach the target in 3D space.
5. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles cases where the target is at the origin and clamps values to prevent mathematical errors.

This refined approach ensures that the inverse kinematics solution accurately calculates the joint angles, allowing the robot arm to reach the target positions effectively.
