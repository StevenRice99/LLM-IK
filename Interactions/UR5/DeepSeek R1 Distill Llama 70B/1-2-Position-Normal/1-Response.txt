To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF robot, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates p = [x, y, z]. 

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP's position is determined by the sum of the transformations from each joint.
2. **Forward Kinematics Insight**: The TCP's position in the world frame is derived from the rotations of the two joints. However, due to the structure, the z-coordinate is fixed at 0.81725 meters, and the x and y coordinates depend solely on θ1.
3. **Inverse Kinematics Solution**: Given the target position p, we solve for θ1 using the x and y components. θ2 can be set to any value since it doesn't affect the TCP's position.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent of x and -y
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, -y)
    # Theta2 can be set to any value since it doesn't affect the position
    theta2 = 0.0
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Extract Coordinates**: The target position p is split into x, y, and z components.
2. **Calculate θ1**: Using the arctangent function, θ1 is determined from the x and y components to satisfy the TCP's position equations.
3. **Set θ2**: Since θ2 does not affect the TCP's position, it is set to 0.

This approach efficiently solves for the necessary joint angles to reach the desired position, considering the robot's structural constraints.
