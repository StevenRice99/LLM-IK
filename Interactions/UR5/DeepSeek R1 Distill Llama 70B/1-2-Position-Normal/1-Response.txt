To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, y, z). Given the robot's structure, we derive the necessary equations and solve them analytically.

### Approach
1. **Problem Setup**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP's position is determined by the joint angles θ1 and θ2.
2. **Kinematic Equations**: Using the geometry of the robot, we derive the equations for the TCP's position in terms of θ1 and θ2.
3. **Simplification**: By squaring and adding the equations, we eliminate θ2 and solve for θ1. Using trigonometric identities, we express the equations in a form that allows us to solve for θ1 analytically.
4. **Solution**: We solve for θ1 and then use it to find θ2, ensuring the solutions are within the joint limits.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.39225  # Length of the second link including the TCP offset

    # Calculate D and P
    D = x**2 + z**2 + A**2 - B**2
    P = D / (2 * A)

    # Compute sqrt(x^2 + z^2)
    sqrt_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    # Handle division by zero for alpha calculation
    if x == 0:
        alpha = math.pi / 2
    else:
        alpha = math.atan(z / x)

    # Calculate the ratio for arcsin
    ratio = P / sqrt_xz

    # Calculate the two possible solutions for theta1
    theta1_sol1 = math.asin(ratio) - alpha
    theta1_sol2 = math.pi - math.asin(ratio) - alpha

    # Calculate theta2 for each theta1 solution using arccos
    theta2_sol1 = math.acos((z - A * math.cos(theta1_sol1)) / B)
    theta2_sol2 = math.acos((z - A * math.cos(theta1_sol2)) / B)

    # Return the first solution pair
    return (theta1_sol1, theta2_sol1)
```

### Explanation
1. **Kinematic Equations**: The TCP's position is expressed in terms of θ1 and θ2 using rotation matrices and the robot's link lengths.
2. **Simplification**: By squaring and adding the equations, we derive a single equation in terms of θ1, which can be solved using trigonometric identities.
3. **Analytical Solution**: Using the arcsin and arccos functions, we find the possible solutions for θ1 and θ2, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem, providing the necessary joint angles for the robot to reach the target position.
