To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates p = (px, py, pz). Here's a detailed step-by-step approach:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Robot Structure:**
   - **Joint 1**: Located at the origin [0, 0, 0], rotates about the Y-axis.
   - **Joint 2**: Positioned at [0, -0.1197, 0.425], rotates about the Y-axis.
   - **TCP**: Located at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to Joint 2.

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - The position of the TCP relative to Joint 2 after rotating by theta2 is:
     ```
     x_tcp_rel = -0.39225 * sin(theta2)
     z_tcp_rel = 0.39225 * cos(theta2)
     ```
   - Adding the position of Joint 2 relative to Joint 1:
     ```
     x = x_tcp_rel
     y = -0.1197
     z = 0.425 + z_tcp_rel
     ```
   - Rotating the TCP's position by theta1 about the Y-axis:
     ```
     x_global = x * cos(theta1) - y * sin(theta1)
     y_global = x * sin(theta1) + y * cos(theta1)
     z_global = z
     ```

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Given a desired position p = (px, py, pz), set up the equations:
     ```
     px = (-0.39225 * sin(theta2)) * cos(theta1) - (-0.1197) * sin(theta1)
     pz = 0.425 + 0.39225 * cos(theta2)
     ```
   - Solve for theta2 using the z-equation:
     ```
     cos(theta2) = (pz - 0.425) / 0.39225
     theta2 = arccos((pz - 0.425) / 0.39225)
     ```
   - Solve for theta1 using the x-equation:
     ```
     theta1 = atan2((-0.39225 * sin(theta2)), (-0.1197))
     ```

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract the desired position components
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the z-coordinate
    cos_theta2 = (pz - 0.425) / 0.39225
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate sin(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the x and y components
    # We know that y should be -0.1197, so we use the x component to find theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-0.39225 * sin_theta2, -0.1197)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation

1. **Calculate theta2:**
   - Using the z-coordinate of the desired position, compute cos(theta2) and solve for theta2 using the arccos function. Clamping ensures the argument is within the valid range.

2. **Calculate theta1:**
   - Using the x and y components, compute theta1 using the arctangent function, ensuring the correct quadrant is considered.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position accurately.
