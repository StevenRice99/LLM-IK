To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at a desired location [x, y, z]. Given the robot's structure, we can derive the necessary equations and solve for the joint angles step by step.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP is fixed relative to the second joint.
2. **Formulate Forward Kinematics**: Express the TCP position in terms of θ1 and θ2.
3. **Derive Inverse Kinematics Equations**: Set up equations based on the desired TCP position and solve for θ1 and θ2.
4. **Solve Trigonometric Equations**: Use trigonometric identities and auxiliary angle methods to solve for θ1 and θ2.
5. **Handle Multiple Solutions**: Consider both possible solutions for θ1 and select the one that matches the target position.

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

        raise ValueError("Denominator is zero, cannot solve.")

        theta2 = phi - theta1
        
        # Check if this solution is close enough to the target
        # If not, try the other candidate
        # For simplicity, we'll select the first candidate
        # In a real implementation, you might need to check both
        
        # Alternatively, compute both and choose the one that gives the smallest error
        # This is a simplified approach for demonstration purposes
        
        # Compute the resulting position for theta1 and theta2
        resulting_x = 0.425 * math.sin(theta1) + 0.39225 * math.sin(phi)

        error = math.sqrt((resulting_x - x)**2 + (resulting_z - z)**2)

### Explanation
1. **Calculate Numerator and Denominator**: Compute the numerator and denominator to find the constant C used in the trigonometric equations.
2. **Compute Magnitude and Delta**: Determine the magnitude of the vector formed by z and x, and compute the angle delta.
3. **Solve for θ1**: Use the auxiliary angle method to solve for θ1, considering both possible solutions.
4. **Compute φ and θ2**: For each θ1 candidate, compute φ and subsequently θ2.
5. **Error Check**: Verify the solution by computing the resulting TCP position and selecting the θ1 that minimizes the error.

This approach ensures that the joint angles θ1 and θ2 are calculated accurately to reach the desired TCP position, considering the robot's constraints and joint limits.
