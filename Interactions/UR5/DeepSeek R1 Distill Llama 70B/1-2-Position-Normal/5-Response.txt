To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot, we'll use the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively find the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates p = [x, y, z]. This approach is robust and handles the nonlinear nature of the kinematic equations effectively.

### Approach
1. **Forward Kinematics Equations**: Define the forward kinematics equations based on the robot's structure.
2. **Newton-Raphson Iteration**: Use the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively solve for θ1 and θ2.
3. **Jacobian Matrix**: Compute the Jacobian matrix to update the joint angles at each iteration.
4. **Tolerance Check**: Stop the iteration when the difference between the current and desired positions is within a specified tolerance.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" using the Newton-Raphson method.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    theta1 = 0.0
    theta2 = 0.0

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        # Compute forward kinematics
        x_current = L1 * math.cos(theta1) + L2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
        z_current = L1 * math.sin(theta1) + L2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)

        error_x = x_current - x_target

            # Jacobian is singular, cannot solve
            break

        # Update joint angles using Newton-Raphson
        delta_theta1 = (J22 * error_x - J12 * error_z) / det_J
        delta_theta2 = (-J21 * error_x + J11 * error_z) / det_J

        theta1 += delta_theta1
        theta2 += delta_theta2

        # Check for convergence
        if abs(error_x) < tolerance and abs(error_z) < tolerance:
            break

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial guess for the joint angles θ1 and θ2.
2. **Forward Kinematics**: Compute the current position of the TCP using the forward kinematics equations.
3. **Error Calculation**: Determine the difference between the current and target positions.
4. **Jacobian Matrix**: Compute the Jacobian matrix to relate the joint rates to the TCP velocity.
5. **Newton-Raphson Update**: Update the joint angles using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix multiplied by the error vector.
6. **Convergence Check**: Stop iterating when the position error is within the specified tolerance.

This method effectively handles the nonlinearities in the kinematic equations and provides a robust solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the 2-DOF robot.
