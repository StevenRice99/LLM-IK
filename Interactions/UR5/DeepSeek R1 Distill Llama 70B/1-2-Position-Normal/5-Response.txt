To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robotic arm, we follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at a desired location (x_d, y_d, z_d).
   - The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis, and the TCP's Y-coordinate is fixed at -0.1197.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   - The position of the TCP relative to the base is given by:
     - \( x = L1 \sin\theta1 + L2 \sin(\theta1 + \theta2) \)
     - \( z = L1 \cos\theta1 - L2 \cos(\theta1 + \theta2) \)
   - Where:
     - \( L1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
     - \( L2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)

3. **Derive the Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Given \( x_d \) and \( z_d \), set up the equations:
     - \( x_d = L1 \sin\theta1 + L2 \sin(\theta1 + \theta2) \)
     - \( z_d = L1 \cos\theta1 - L2 \cos(\theta1 + \theta2) \)
   - Introduce \( \alpha = \theta1 + \theta2 \) to simplify:
     - \( x_d = L1 \sin\theta1 + L2 \sin\alpha \)
     - \( z_d = L1 \cos\theta1 - L2 \cos\alpha \)
   - Square and add both equations to eliminate \( \alpha \):
     - \( x_d^2 + z_d^2 = L1^2 + L2^2 + 2L1L2 \cos(\theta1 - \alpha) \)
   - Solve for \( \cos(\theta1 - \alpha) \) and use trigonometric identities to find \( \theta1 \).

4. **Solve for θ1:**
   - Use the combined equation to express \( \theta1 \) in terms of \( x_d \) and \( z_d \).
   - Apply the arctangent function to find the base angle and then use the arcsin method to account for multiple solutions.

5. **Calculate θ2:**
   - Once \( \theta1 \) is determined, substitute back into the original equations to solve for \( \theta2 \).

6. **Implement the Solution in Code:**
   - Use numerical methods to handle the nonlinear equations, ensuring the solutions are within the joint limits.

### Solution Code

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225

    # Calculate C
    C = x_d**2 + z_d**2 + L1**2 - L2**2

    # Compute the right-hand side
    rhs = C / (2 * L1)

    # Use arctan2 to find the base angle
    base_angle = np.arctan2(x_d, z_d)

    # Calculate the possible theta1 values
    theta1 = base_angle + np.arcsin(rhs / np.sqrt(x_d**2 + z_d**2))

    # Calculate theta2 using the original equations
    theta2 = np.arctan2(x_d - L1 * np.sin(theta1), z_d + L1 * np.cos(theta1)) - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Calculate C:** This term combines the desired position and link lengths to form a constant used in solving for θ1.
- **Compute rhs:** The right-hand side of the equation derived from the Pythagorean identity, scaled by the link lengths.
- **Base Angle:** Found using arctan2 to determine the direction towards the target position.
- **Theta1:** Calculated by adding the base angle and the arcsin of the scaled rhs, considering the magnitude of the target position.
- **Theta2:** Derived from the difference between the arctan2 of the adjusted target position and theta1.

This approach ensures that the joint angles are calculated accurately, considering the geometric constraints and multiple possible solutions, leading to the correct positioning of the TCP.
