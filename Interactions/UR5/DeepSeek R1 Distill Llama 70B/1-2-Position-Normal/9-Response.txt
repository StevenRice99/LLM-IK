To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot, we'll use the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively find the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates p = [x, y, z]. This approach effectively handles the nonlinear nature of the kinematic equations.

### Approach
1. **Forward Kinematics Equations**: Define the TCP's position in terms of θ1 and θ2.
2. **Jacobian Matrix**: Compute the partial derivatives of the TCP's position with respect to each joint angle.
3. **Newton-Raphson Iteration**: Use the Jacobian matrix to iteratively update the joint angles until the TCP reaches the desired position within a specified tolerance.
4. **Convergence Check**: Stop the iteration when the position error is within the tolerance.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" using the Newton-Raphson method.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".

```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with initial guesses for the joint angles θ1 and θ2.
2. **Forward Kinematics**: Compute the current TCP position using the forward kinematics equations.
3. **Error Calculation**: Determine the difference between the current and target positions.
4. **Jacobian Matrix**: Compute the Jacobian matrix to relate joint rates to Cartesian velocities.
5. **Newton-Raphson Update**: Update the joint angles using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix multiplied by the error vector.
6. **Convergence Check**: Stop iterating when the position error is within the specified tolerance.

This method effectively handles the nonlinearities in the kinematic equations and provides a robust solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the 2-DOF robot.
