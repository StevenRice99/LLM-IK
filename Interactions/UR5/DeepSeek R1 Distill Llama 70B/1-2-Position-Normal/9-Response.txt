To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, we'll use a geometric approach based on the law of cosines and trigonometric identities. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Approach
1. **Calculate the Distance**: Compute the distance from the base to the target position in the X-Z plane.
2. **Law of Cosines**: Use the law of cosines to find the angle θ2 of the second joint.
3. **Calculate A and B**: Determine the coefficients A and B using the lengths of the links and θ2.
4. **Solve for θ**: Use the derived equations to find sin(θ) and cos(θ), then compute θ using atan2.
5. **Find θ1**: Calculate θ1 as the difference between θ and θ2.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the X-Z plane
    distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    # Use the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - distance**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Calculate A and B
    A = L1 * math.cos(theta2) + L2
    B = L1 * math.sin(theta2)

    # Calculate sin(theta) and cos(theta)
    denominator = A**2 + B**2
    sin_theta = (A * x - B * z) / denominator
    cos_theta = (B * x + A * z) / denominator

    # Find theta using atan2
    theta = math.atan2(sin_theta, cos_theta)

    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = theta - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from the base to the target is computed using the Pythagorean theorem in the X-Z plane.
2. **Law of Cosines**: This helps determine the angle θ2 by considering the triangle formed by the two links and the line from the base to the TCP.
3. **A and B Calculation**: These coefficients are derived from the link lengths and θ2, simplifying the subsequent trigonometric calculations.
4. **Solving for θ**: Using the derived equations for sin(θ) and cos(θ), we find θ using the atan2 function to handle the correct quadrant.
5. **Finding θ1**: Finally, θ1 is calculated as the difference between θ and θ2, completing the solution for the joint angles.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by leveraging geometric principles and trigonometric identities, ensuring accurate positioning of the TCP.
