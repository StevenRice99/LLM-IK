To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm accurately, we need to derive the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired position and orientation. The approach involves setting up the forward kinematics equations and solving them for the joint angles, considering both position and orientation.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   - The position of the TCP is determined by the sum of the positions of each link after applying the respective joint rotations.
   - The orientation of the TCP is a result of the combined rotations of both joints.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - Express the TCP's position in terms of θ1 and θ2 using trigonometric functions.
   - Include the orientation requirements in the equations to ensure both position and orientation are met.

3. **Solving the System of Equations:**
   - Use mathematical methods to solve the system of equations for θ1 and θ2.
   - Ensure the solution accounts for the full kinematics of the robot, including the direction of rotations and the coordinate system.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Translate the derived equations into code, ensuring accurate calculations for θ1 and θ2.
   - Test the solution with various inputs to verify its correctness.

### Solution Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [rx, ry, rz].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Calculate theta1 using the position equations
    A = (x - 0.39225 * math.sin(ry)) / 0.425
    B = (z - 0.39225 * math.cos(ry)) / 0.425
    theta1 = math.atan2(A, B)

    # Calculate theta2 based on the orientation
    theta2 = ry - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution calculates the necessary joint angles by first determining θ1 from the position equations and then deriving θ2 from the orientation requirement. The approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are achieved as specified.
