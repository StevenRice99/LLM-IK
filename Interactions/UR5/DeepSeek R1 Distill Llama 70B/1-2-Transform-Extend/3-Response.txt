To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP's position is determined by the joint angles `q1` and `q2`.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations**: Derive the equations that relate the joint angles to the TCP's position and orientation. The position equations are:
   - `px = 0.39225*sin(q2)*cos(q1) - (0.425 + 0.39225*cos(q2))*sin(q1)`
   - `pz = 0.39225*sin(q2)*sin(q1) + (0.425 + 0.39225*cos(q2))*cos(q1)`
   - The orientation's Y component is `ry = q1 + q2`.

3. **Derive the Analytical Solution**:
   - From the position equations, derive an equation involving only `q2` by squaring and adding the `px` and `pz` equations.
   - Solve for `cos(q2)` and then find `q2`.
   - Use the orientation equation to find `q1` as `q1 = ry - q2`.

4. **Implement the Solution in Code**: Using the derived equations, implement the inverse kinematics function to compute the joint angles given the desired TCP pose.

Here is the Python function implementing the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Calculate D based on the position equations
    D = px**2 + pz**2 - 0.3345

    # Compute cos(q2)
    cos_q2 = D / 0.334

    # Clamp cos_q2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate q2
    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)

    # Calculate q1 based on the orientation
    q1 = ry - q2

    return (q1, q2)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles `q1` and `q2` to reach the desired TCP pose `(p, r)` using the derived analytical solution.
