To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Derive the Analytical Solution:**
   - Start with the forward kinematics equations for the TCP's position.
   - Square and add the \( px \) and \( pz \) equations to eliminate \( q_1 \).
   - Solve the resulting equation for \( \cos(q_2) \).
   - Use the orientation equation to solve for \( q_1 \) once \( q_2 \) is known.

2. **Implement the Solution in Code:**
   - Translate the derived equations into a Python function.
   - Ensure the solution handles the calculation of \( q_2 \) using the arccosine function and solves for \( q_1 \) using the orientation.

Here is the Python function implementing the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Calculate D based on the position equations
    D = px**2 + pz**2 - 0.3345

    # Compute cos(q2)
    cos_q2 = D / 0.334

    # Clamp cos_q2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate q2
    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)

    # Calculate q1 based on the orientation
    q1 = ry - q2

    return (q1, q2)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) to reach the desired TCP pose using the derived analytical solution.
