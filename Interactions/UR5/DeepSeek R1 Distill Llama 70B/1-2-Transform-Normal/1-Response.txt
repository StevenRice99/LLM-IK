To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. The robot's structure allows movement in the X-Z plane with both joints rotating about the Y-axis. The solution involves solving a system of equations derived from the forward kinematics, considering both position and orientation constraints.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Robot Structure:**
   - The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP's position is determined by the sum of the rotations of both joints.

2. **Position Equations:**
   - The TCP's position in the X and Z directions is given by:
     - \( x = A \sin\theta_1 + B \sin\theta_2 \)
     - \( z = A \cos\theta_1 + B \cos\theta_2 \)
   - Where \( A = 0.425 \) and \( B = 0.39225 \).

3. **Orientation Constraint:**
   - The orientation about the Y-axis is the sum of the joint angles: \( \theta_1 + \theta_2 = \text{ry} \).

4. **Substitute Orientation into Position Equations:**
   - Express \( \theta_2 \) as \( \text{ry} - \theta_1 \).
   - Substitute into the position equations and expand using trigonometric identities.

5. **Solve for Joint Angles:**
   - Derive equations for \( \sin\theta_1 \) and \( \cos\theta_1 \) using matrix inversion.
   - Compute \( \theta_1 \) using \( \tan^{-1} \) and then find \( \theta_2 \) using the orientation constraint.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [rx, ry, rz].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225
    x, _, z = p  # y is fixed and ignored as per robot structure
    _, ry, __ = r  # rx and rz are zero as per robot's rotational constraints

    # Calculate coefficients
    C = A - B * math.cos(ry)
    D = B * math.sin(ry)
    E = A + B * math.cos(ry)
    F = B * math.sin(ry)

    det = A**2 - B**2

    # Calculate sin(theta1) and cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = (E * x - D * z) / det
    cos_theta1 = (-F * x + C * z) / det

    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Calculate theta2 based on the orientation constraint
    theta2 = ry - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function computes the necessary joint angles to achieve the desired TCP position and orientation, considering the robot's constraints and structure.
