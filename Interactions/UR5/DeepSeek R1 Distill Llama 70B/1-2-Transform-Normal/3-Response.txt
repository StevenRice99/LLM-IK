To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. The robot's structure allows movement in the X-Z plane with both joints rotating about the Y-axis. The solution involves solving a system of equations derived from the forward kinematics, considering both position and orientation constraints.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure:**
   - The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP's position is determined by the sum of the rotations of both joints.

2. **Position and Orientation Equations:**
   - The TCP's position in the X and Z directions is given by:
     - \( x = A \sin\theta_1 + B \sin\theta_2 \)
     - \( z = A \cos\theta_1 + B \cos\theta_2 \)
   - The orientation about the Y-axis is the sum of the joint angles: \( \theta_1 + \theta_2 = \text{ry} \).

3. **Substitute Orientation into Position Equations:**
   - Express \( \theta_2 \) as \( \text{ry} - \theta_1 \).
   - Substitute into the position equations and expand using trigonometric identities.

4. **Solve for Joint Angles:**
   - Derive equations for \( \sin\theta_1 \) and \( \cos\theta_1 \) using matrix inversion.
   - Compute \( \theta_1 \) using \( \tan^{-1} \) and then find \( \theta_2 \) using the orientation constraint.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [rx, ry, rz].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    A = 0.425
    B = 0.39225
    x, _, z = p  # y is fixed and ignored as per robot structure
    _, ry, __ = r  # rx and rz are zero as per robot's rotational constraints

    # Calculate coefficients
    C = A - B * math.cos(ry)
    D = B * math.sin(ry)
    E = A + B * math.cos(ry)
    F = B * math.sin(ry)

    det = A**2 - B**2

    # Calculate sin(theta1) and cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = (E * x - D * z) / det
    cos_theta1 = (-F * x + C * z) / det

    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Calculate theta2 based on the orientation constraint
    theta2 = ry - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Matrix Formulation:**
   - The position equations are formulated into a matrix equation to solve for \( \sin\theta_1 \) and \( \cos\theta_1 \).
   - The determinant of the matrix is calculated to ensure the system of equations is solvable.

2. **Trigonometric Identities:**
   - Trigonometric identities are used to expand the sine and cosine of difference angles, simplifying the equations.

3. **Arctangent Calculation:**
   - The joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined using the arctangent function, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected based on the signs of \( \sin\theta_1 \) and \( \cos\theta_1 \).

4. **Orientation Constraint:**
   - The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is derived from the orientation constraint, ensuring the TCP's orientation matches the desired value.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, ensuring accurate and efficient computation of the required joint angles.
