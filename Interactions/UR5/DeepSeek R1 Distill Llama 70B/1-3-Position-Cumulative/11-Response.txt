To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator accurately, we'll implement an iterative Jacobian method. This approach adjusts the joint angles incrementally to move the TCP towards the target position until the desired accuracy is achieved.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define DH Parameters:**
   - Link 1: a=0, α=π/2, d=0, θ=θ1
   - Link 2: a=0.425, α=π/2, d=0, θ=θ2
   - Link 3: a=0.39225, α=π/2, d=0, θ=θ3
   - TCP: a=0, α=0, d=0.093

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   Compute the TCP position given the joint angles using the DH transformation matrices.

3. **Jacobian Matrix:**
   Calculate the partial derivatives of the TCP position with respect to each joint angle to form the Jacobian matrix.

4. **Iterative Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Compute the error between the target and current TCP positions.
   - Calculate the joint increments using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix with a damping factor for numerical stability.
   - Update the joint angles and repeat until the error is minimized or the maximum iterations are reached.

### Explanation:

1. **Forward Kinematics:** This function calculates the TCP position based on the current joint angles using DH transformation matrices, which define the position and orientation of each link in the robot.

2. **Jacobian Matrix:** The Jacobian matrix is computed by taking partial derivatives of the TCP position with respect to each joint angle. This matrix represents the rate of change of the TCP position with respect to joint movements.

3. **Inverse Kinematics:** Using an iterative approach, the algorithm starts with an initial guess for the joint angles. It then computes the error between the current and target positions, calculates the necessary joint increments using the Jacobian matrix, and updates the joint angles. This process repeats until the error is minimized or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

4. **Damping Factor:** A damping factor (lambda_) is added to the Jacobian matrix to improve numerical stability and avoid singularities during inversion.

By implementing this iterative Jacobian method, the robot's joint angles are adjusted precisely to reach the desired TCP position accurately.
