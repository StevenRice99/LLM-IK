To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll calculate the joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3 needed to position the TCP at the desired coordinates. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate theta1 (First Joint Angle):**
   - Use the arctangent of the x and z coordinates to determine theta1, which positions the first joint to align the robot towards the target in the X-Z plane.

2. **Adjust Coordinates for theta1:**
   - Subtract the contribution of the third link (0.39225) from the x and z coordinates based on theta1 to isolate the remaining coordinates for the second joint.

3. **Calculate theta2 (Second Joint Angle):**
   - Determine theta2 by finding the arctangent of the adjusted x and z coordinates, then subtract theta1 to get the relative angle for the second joint.

4. **Calculate theta3 (Third Joint Angle):**
   - Use the arctangent of the y coordinate and the adjusted x coordinate to find theta3, which adjusts the third joint to reach the desired Y position.

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent of x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust x and z by subtracting the contribution from the third link
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - theta1
    
    # Calculate theta3 using arctangent of y and adjusted x
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, adjusted_x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering each link's contribution and ensuring the angles are within the specified limits.
