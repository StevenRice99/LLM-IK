To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll calculate the joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3 needed to position the TCP at the desired coordinates. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Calculate theta1 (First Joint Angle):**
   - Use the arctangent of the x and z coordinates to determine theta1, which positions the first joint to align the robot towards the target in the X-Z plane.

2. **Adjust Coordinates for theta1:**
   - Subtract the contribution of the second and third links from the x and z coordinates based on theta1 to isolate the remaining coordinates for the second joint.

3. **Calculate theta2 (Second Joint Angle):**
   - Determine theta2 by finding the arctangent of the adjusted x and z coordinates.

4. **Adjust Coordinates for theta2:**
   - Further adjust the x and z coordinates by accounting for theta2 to isolate the contribution of the third joint.

5. **Calculate theta3 (Third Joint Angle):**
   - Use the arctangent of the adjusted y coordinate and the remaining x coordinate to find theta3, which adjusts the third joint to reach the desired Y position.

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent of x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust x and z by subtracting the contribution from the second and third links
    adjusted_x = x - 0.425 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.425 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Adjust x and z again for theta2
    adjusted_x2 = adjusted_x * math.cos(theta2) + adjusted_z * math.sin(theta2)
    adjusted_z2 = -adjusted_x * math.sin(theta2) + adjusted_z * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y + 0.1197, adjusted_x2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering the contributions of each link and ensuring the angles are within the specified limits.
