To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll use an iterative approach based on the Jacobian matrix. This method allows us to adjust the joint angles incrementally until the TCP reaches the target position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define DH Parameters:**
   - Link 1: a=0, α=π/2, d=0, θ=θ1
   - Link 2: a=0.425, α=π/2, d=0, θ=θ2
   - Link 3: a=0.39225, α=π/2, d=0, θ=θ3
   - TCP: a=0, α=0, d=0.093

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   Compute the TCP position given the joint angles using the DH transformation matrices.

3. **Jacobian Matrix:**
   Calculate the partial derivatives of the TCP position with respect to each joint angle to form the Jacobian matrix.

4. **Iterative Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Compute the error between the target and current TCP positions.
   - Calculate the joint increments using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix.
   - Update the joint angles and repeat until the error is minimized.

### Explanation:

1. **Forward Kinematics:** This function calculates the TCP position based on the current joint angles using the DH transformation matrices.

2. **Jacobian Matrix:** This function computes the Jacobian matrix by taking partial derivatives of the TCP position with respect to each joint angle.

3. **Inverse Kinematics:** This iterative method uses the Jacobian matrix to adjust the joint angles incrementally until the TCP reaches the target position within a specified tolerance. The damping factor (lambda_) is added to improve numerical stability when inverting the Jacobian.

By following this approach, the robot's joint angles are adjusted iteratively to reach the desired TCP position accurately.
