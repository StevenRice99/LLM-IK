To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired target position. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Robot Structure
The robot has three revolute joints, all rotating around the Y-axis. The link lengths and offsets are as follows:
- **Joint 1**: Position [0, 0, 0]
- **Joint 2**: Position [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
- **Joint 3**: Position [0, 0, 0.39225]
- **TCP**: Offset from Joint 3 by [0, 0.093, 0]

### Step 2: Express the TCP Position in Terms of Joint Angles
The position of the TCP can be expressed as a combination of the rotations of all three joints. Using trigonometric relationships, we can model the TCP's position.

### Step 3: Calculate the Position of Joint 3
Given the desired TCP position (x, y, z), the position of Joint 3 is:
- \( x_3 = x \)
- \( y_3 = y - 0.093 \)
- \( z_3 = z \)

### Step 4: Solve for Joint Angles
Using trigonometric relationships:

1. **Joint 1 (θ1)**:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{x}{z}\right)
   \]

2. **Joint 2 (θ2)**:
   After accounting for Joint 1's rotation, the remaining Z component is used to find θ2:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan\left(\frac{y_3}{z_3}\right)
   \]

3. **Joint 3 (θ3)**:
   The remaining Y component after accounting for the first two joints gives θ3:
   \[
   \theta_3 = \arctan\left(\frac{y_3}{z_3}\right)
   \]

### Step 5: Implement the Solution in Python
Here's the Python function implementing the above steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Calculates the joint angles needed to reach the desired TCP position.
    :param p: The desired TCP position as (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the position of Joint 3 relative to the TCP
    y_joint3 = y - 0.093  # Offset from Joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate Joint 1 angle
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate Joint 2 angle
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_joint3, z)
    
    # Calculate Joint 3 angle
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_joint3, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Step 6: Verify the Solution
To verify, if we input the position (0, -0.0267, 0.81725), the function should return angles close to zero, confirming the correctness of the solution.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, ensuring each joint's contribution is accurately calculated.
