To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach that accurately models the robot's geometry and derives the necessary equations to find the joint angles. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Robot's Geometry

The robot has three revolute joints with the following properties:

- **Joint 1:** Position [0, 0, 0], Orientation [0, 0, 0], Axis Y, Limits [-6.2831853, 6.2831853]
- **Joint 2:** Position [0, -0.1197, 0.425], Orientation [0, 0, 0], Axis Y, Limits [-6.2831853, 6.2831853]
- **Joint 3:** Position [0, 0, 0.39225], Orientation [0, 0, 0], Axis Y, Limits [-6.2831853, 6.2831853]
- **TCP:** Position [0, 0.093, 0], Orientation [0, 0, 0]

### Step 2: Adjust the Target Position

The TCP has a Y-offset of 0.093. To account for this, we adjust the target position by subtracting this offset from the Y-coordinate.

```python
y_adjusted = y - 0.093
```

### Step 3: Solve for Theta1 and Theta2

Using the adjusted target position, we solve for the first two joint angles. We'll use a geometric approach based on the law of cosines to relate the joint angles to the target position.

1. **Calculate the Distance from Joint 1 to the Target:**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem, compute the distance from Joint 1 to the target position.

   ```python
   distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
   ```

2. **Determine Theta1:**
   Theta1 is the angle between the X-axis and the line connecting Joint 1 to the target. Use `math.atan2` to find this angle.

   ```python
   theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
   ```

3. **Calculate the Remaining Distance After Theta1:**
   Subtract the contribution of Theta1 from the total distance to find the remaining distance that Theta2 must account for.

   ```python
   remaining_distance = distance - (A * math.cos(theta1))
   ```

4. **Determine Theta2:**
   Use the law of cosines to solve for Theta2 based on the remaining distance and the known link lengths.

   ```python
   cos_theta2 = (remaining_distance**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * remaining_distance)
   theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
   ```

### Step 4: Solve for Theta3

After determining Theta1 and Theta2, we solve for Theta3 to ensure the TCP reaches the exact target position. This involves adjusting Theta3 to account for any remaining positional error.

1. **Calculate the Position After Theta1 and Theta2:**
   Using forward kinematics, compute the position of the TCP based on Theta1 and Theta2.

   ```python
   x_current = A * math.cos(theta1) + B * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
   z_current = A * math.sin(theta1) + B * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
   ```

2. **Determine the Remaining Position:**
   Find the difference between the target position and the current position after Theta1 and Theta2.

   ```python
   delta_x = x - x_current
   delta_z = z - z_current
   ```

3. **Adjust Theta3:**
   Use the remaining position to adjust Theta3. This may involve solving a simpler equation based on the remaining distance.

   ```python
   theta3 = math.atan2(delta_x, delta_z)
   ```

### Step 5: Implement the Solution in Code

Now, let's implement the above steps into the inverse kinematics function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust the target position for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y - 0.093
    
    # Link lengths
    A = 0.39225  # Length from Joint 1 to Joint 2
    B = 0.093    # Length from Joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the distance from Joint 1 to the target
    distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the remaining distance after accounting for theta1
    remaining_distance = distance - (A * math.cos(theta1))
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (remaining_distance**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * remaining_distance)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate the current position after theta1 and theta2
    x_current = A * math.cos(theta1) + B * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    z_current = A * math.sin(theta1) + B * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Determine the remaining position to adjust theta3
    delta_x = x - x_current
    delta_z = z - z_current
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(delta_x, delta_z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Adjusting the Target Position:**
   The TCP's Y-offset is subtracted from the target's Y-coordinate to ensure the calculations are based on the correct position relative to the third joint.

2. **Solving for Theta1:**
   Theta1 is determined using `math.atan2` to find the angle between the X-axis and the line connecting Joint 1 to the target. This gives the initial orientation needed to point towards the target.

3. **Solving for Theta2:**
   Using the law of cosines, Theta2 is calculated to adjust the position further towards the target. This step ensures that the combined lengths of the first two links are used effectively to reach the target.

4. **Solving for Theta3:**
   After accounting for Theta1 and Theta2, any remaining positional error is corrected by adjusting Theta3. This ensures that the TCP reaches the exact target position.

This approach systematically breaks down the problem into manageable parts, ensuring that each joint's contribution is accurately calculated to achieve the desired TCP position.
