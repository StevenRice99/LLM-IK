To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 3-DOF robot arm, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. The key insight is to recognize that the arm's movement is constrained such that the y-position of the TCP is fixed, allowing us to focus on solving for the x and z coordinates using the first two joints, with the third joint set to zero.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has three revolute joints, all rotating about the Y-axis. The TCP's position is determined by the cumulative effect of these rotations and the fixed positions of each link.
2. **Geometric Insight**: Since all joints rotate about the Y-axis, the TCP's movement is confined to the X-Z plane, with the Y-position fixed. This reduces the problem to a 2D inverse kinematics problem in the X-Z plane.
3. **Analytical Solution**: Using trigonometric identities and the law of cosines, we derive the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired (x, z) coordinates. The third joint angle θ3 is set to zero as it doesn't affect the TCP's position in the X-Z plane.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Calculate coefficients for the equation
    C = 2 * A * x
    D = -2 * A * z
    E = B**2 - x**2 - z**2 - A**2

    # Calculate the magnitude of the vector (C, D)
    magnitude = math.sqrt(C**2 + D**2)

    if magnitude == 0:
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        # Calculate theta1 using the arctangent and arccosine
        theta1 = math.atan2(C, D) - math.acos(E / magnitude)

    # Calculate sin(phi) and cos(phi)
    sin_phi = (-x - A * math.sin(theta1)) / B
    cos_phi = (z - A * math.cos(theta1)) / B

    # Ensure sin_phi and cos_phi are within valid ranges to avoid NaN
    if abs(sin_phi) > 1:
        sin_phi = math.copysign(1, sin_phi)
    if abs(cos_phi) > 1:
        cos_phi = math.copysign(1, cos_phi)

    phi = math.atan2(sin_phi, cos_phi)
    theta2 = phi - theta1

    # Theta3 is set to 0 as it doesn't affect the position
    theta3 = 0.0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Extract Position Components**: The desired position `p` is split into its x, y, and z components. The y-component is fixed and can be ignored for the inverse kinematics calculation.
2. **Define Link Lengths**: The lengths of the first and second links (A and B) are defined based on the problem's geometric details.
3. **Calculate Coefficients**: Using the desired x and z positions, coefficients C, D, and E are computed to set up the trigonometric equations.
4. **Solve for θ1**: Using the arctangent and arccosine functions, θ1 is determined to satisfy the derived equations.
5. **Solve for θ2**: Using θ1, the angle φ (sum of θ1 and θ2) is found, and θ2 is derived by subtracting θ1 from φ.
6. **Set θ3**: The third joint angle is set to zero as it doesn't influence the TCP's position in the X-Z plane.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem using analytical methods, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position in the X-Z plane while adhering to the constraints of the robot's geometry.
