To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has three revolute joints, all rotating about the Y-axis. The TCP's position is determined by the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

2. **Model the Forward Kinematics**: Using rotation matrices for each joint, we express the TCP's position in the base frame. The Y-component is fixed, so we focus on the X and Z components.

3. **Derive Equations**: We derive two equations from the forward kinematics involving θ1 and θ2. By squaring and adding these equations, we eliminate θ1 and solve for θ2.

4. **Solve for θ2**: Using the derived equation, we compute cosθ2 and then find θ2.

5. **Solve for θ1**: Using θ2, we compute sinθ1 and cosθ1, then find θ1 using the arctangent function.

6. **Set θ3**: Since the problem only specifies position, we set θ3 to zero.

Here is the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    A = 0.39225  # Link3 length
    B = 0.425    # Link2 length
    p_x, _, p_z = p  # y is fixed at -0.0267, so we ignore it

    # Calculate cosθ2
    numerator = p_x**2 + p_z**2 - A**2 - B**2
    denominator = 2 * A * B
    cosθ2 = numerator / denominator

    # Ensure cosθ2 is within valid range [-1, 1]
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)

    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)

    # Calculate C and D
    C = A * math.cos(θ2) + B
    D = A * math.sin(θ2)

    # Calculate sinθ1 and cosθ1
    denominator_sin_cos = C**2 + D**2
    sinθ1 = (C * p_x - D * p_z) / denominator_sin_cos
    cosθ1 = (D * p_x + C * p_z) / denominator_sin_cos

    # Calculate θ1
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)

    # θ3 is set to 0 as it doesn't affect position
    θ3 = 0.0

    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

This function computes the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 (set to zero) to reach the desired TCP position p.
