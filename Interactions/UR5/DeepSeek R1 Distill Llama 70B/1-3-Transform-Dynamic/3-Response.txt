To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll derive the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate the First Joint Angle (θ1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis, affecting the X and Z coordinates.
   - Use the arctangent of the X and Z positions of the TCP to find θ1.
   - θ1 = atan2(x, z)

2. **Calculate the Second Joint Angle (θ2):**
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis, affecting the Y and Z coordinates.
   - Consider the position relative to the first joint and use the arctangent of the Y and Z positions to find θ2.
   - θ2 = atan2(y, z)

3. **Calculate the Third Joint Angle (θ3):**
   - The third joint rotates around the Y-axis, primarily affecting the orientation.
   - Use the desired orientation to determine θ3. Since the orientation is [0, 1, 0], which is a 90-degree rotation around the Y-axis, θ3 should be set to π/2 radians.

By following these steps, we can determine the joint angles needed to reach the desired TCP position and orientation.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the first joint angle using arctangent of x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the second joint angle using arctangent of y and z
    theta2 = math.atan2(y, z)
    
    # The third joint angle is determined by the desired orientation
    # For orientation [0, 1, 0], set theta3 to pi/2 radians
    theta3 = math.pi / 2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
