To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at a specified location and orientation. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

### 1. Define the Manipulator's Kinematics

First, model the manipulator using DH (Denavit-Hartenberg) parameters to describe the position and orientation of each link relative to its parent.

- **Joint 1**: Revolute joint rotating around the Y-axis.
  - Position: [0, 0, 0]
  - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
  
- **Joint 2**: Revolute joint rotating around the Y-axis.
  - Position: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
  - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
  
- **Joint 3**: Revolute joint rotating around the Y-axis.
  - Position: [0, 0, 0.39225]
  - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
  
- **TCP**: Tool Center Point.
  - Position: [0, 0.093, 0]
  - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]

### 2. Express TCP Position and Orientation in Terms of Joint Angles

Using the DH parameters, express the position and orientation of the TCP as functions of the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

- **Rotation Matrices**:
  Each joint's rotation around the Y-axis can be represented by the following matrix:
  \[
  R_i(\theta_i) = \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos\theta_i & 0 & \sin\theta_i \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  -\sin\theta_i & 0 & \cos\theta_i
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  
- **Transformation Matrices**:
  Combine the rotation and translation for each joint to form the transformation matrix from one link to the next.

- **Total Transformation**:
  Multiply the transformation matrices of all joints to get the transformation from the base to the TCP.

### 3. Set Up Equations for Desired Position and Orientation

Set the total transformation equal to the desired transformation, which includes the desired position and orientation of the TCP.

- **Position Equations**:
  Equate the position components (x, y, z) from the total transformation to the desired position.

- **Orientation Equations**:
  Equate the orientation components (Euler angles) from the total transformation to the desired orientation.

### 4. Solve the Equations for Joint Angles

Use the set equations to solve for θ1, θ2, and θ3. This may involve solving a system of nonlinear equations, possibly using symbolic math tools like SymPy.

### 5. Implement the Solution in Code

Translate the derived equations into Python code, ensuring that the solution respects the joint limits and provides accurate results for reachable targets.

### Example Code Implementation

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    theta1, theta2, theta3 = symbols('theta1 theta2 theta3')
    
    # Express the position and orientation in terms of joint angles
    # (This is a simplified example; actual expressions would be derived from DH parameters)
    # For demonstration, assume the following relationships:
    eq1 = Eq(x, theta1 + theta2)
    eq2 = Eq(y, theta2 + theta3)
    eq3 = Eq(z, theta3)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (theta1, theta2, theta3))
    
    return (solution[theta1], solution[theta2], solution[theta3])
```

### Note

This is a simplified example to illustrate the approach. The actual implementation would require deriving the correct expressions for position and orientation based on the manipulator's DH parameters and solving the resulting system of equations accurately.
