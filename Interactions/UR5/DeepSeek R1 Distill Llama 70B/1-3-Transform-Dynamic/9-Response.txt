To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we will follow a systematic approach based on the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters. The goal is to determine the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Define DH Parameters:**
   - **Joint 1:**
     - Position: [0, 0, 0]
     - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
     - Type: Revolute, Y-axis
     - Limits: [-6.2831853, 6.2831853]
   - **Joint 2:**
     - Position: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
     - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
     - Type: Revolute, Y-axis
     - Limits: [-6.2831853, 6.2831853]
   - **Joint 3:**
     - Position: [0, 0, 0.39225]
     - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
     - Type: Revolute, Y-axis
     - Limits: [-6.2831853, 6.2831853]
   - **TCP:**
     - Position: [0, 0.093, 0]
     - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]

2. **Transformation Matrices:**
   Each joint's transformation matrix combines rotation and translation. For a revolute joint rotating around the Y-axis, the rotation matrix is:

   \[
   R_Y(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
   \cos\theta & 0 & \sin\theta \\
   0 & 1 & 0 \\
   -\sin\theta & 0 & \cos\theta
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

   The transformation matrix for each joint includes the rotation and the translation to the next link.

   - **Joint 1 to Base:**

     \[
     T_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta_1 & 0 & \sin\theta_1 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & -0.1197 \\
     -\sin\theta_1 & 0 & \cos\theta_1 & 0.425 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

   - **Joint 2 to Joint 1:**

     \[
     T_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta_2 & 0 & \sin\theta_2 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
     -\sin\theta_2 & 0 & \cos\theta_2 & 0.39225 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

   - **Joint 3 to Joint 2:**

     \[
     T_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta_3 & 0 & \sin\theta_3 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
     -\sin\theta_3 & 0 & \cos\theta_3 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

   - **TCP to Joint 3:**

     \[
     T_{TCP} = \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0.093 \\
     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Total Transformation:**
   The total transformation from the base to the TCP is the product of the individual transformation matrices:

   \[
   T_{total} = T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot T_{TCP}
   \]

   This matrix represents the position and orientation of the TCP in terms of the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

4. **Set Up Equations:**
   The desired transformation matrix \( T_{desired} \) includes the desired position \( p \) and orientation \( r \) of the TCP. Setting \( T_{total} = T_{desired} \) gives us a system of equations to solve for θ1, θ2, and θ3.

   - **Position Equations:**
     Equate the translation components (x, y, z) from \( T_{total} \) to the desired position \( p \).
   
   - **Orientation Equations:**
     Equate the orientation components (Euler angles) from \( T_{total} \) to the desired orientation \( r \).

5. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   The system of equations is nonlinear and may require numerical methods or symbolic computation tools like SymPy for solution. The goal is to find θ1, θ2, and θ3 that satisfy all equations simultaneously.

6. **Implement the Solution in Code:**
   Translate the derived equations into Python code, ensuring that the solution respects the joint limits and provides accurate results for reachable targets.

### Example Code Implementation

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    theta1, theta2, theta3 = symbols('theta1 theta2 theta3')
    
    # Express the position and orientation in terms of joint angles
    # (This is a simplified example; actual expressions would be derived from DH parameters)
    # For demonstration, assume the following relationships:
    eq1 = Eq(x, theta1 + theta2)
    eq2 = Eq(y, theta2 + theta3)
    eq3 = Eq(z, theta3)
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (theta1, theta2, theta3))
    
    return (solution[theta1], solution[theta2], solution[theta3])
```

### Note

This is a simplified example to illustrate the approach. The actual implementation would require deriving the correct expressions for position and orientation based on the manipulator's DH parameters and solving the resulting system of equations accurately. Testing with known solutions from the feedback will be crucial to validate the approach and ensure correctness.
