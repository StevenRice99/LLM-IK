To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 that will move the TCP to the desired position and orientation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

### Approach
1. **Model the Robot**: Represent each joint's transformation using rotation matrices and translation vectors. Since all joints are revolute and rotate about the Y-axis, the rotation matrices will be about the Y-axis.
2. **Express Position and Orientation**: Derive the equations for the TCP's position and orientation in terms of the joint angles. The position equations are derived from the cumulative transformations, while the orientation is determined by the sum of the joint angles.
3. **Solve for Joint Angles**: Set up the equations based on the target position and orientation, and solve for the joint angles using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    
    # Extract target position
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Constants
    A = 0.39225  # Sum of the third link's translation and TCP offset in Z
    B = 0.425    # Second link's translation in Z
    
    # Calculate C
    C = (px**2 + pz**2 + B**2 - A**2) / (2 * B)
    
    # Calculate R
    R = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    
    # Calculate alpha
    alpha = math.atan2(pz, px)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.asin(C / R) - alpha
    theta1_alt = math.pi - math.asin(C / R) - alpha
    
    # Choose the appropriate theta1 based on the target position
    # For simplicity, we'll choose the first solution
    theta1 = theta1
    
    # Calculate phi from equation (1)
    sin_phi = (px - B * math.sin(theta1)) / A
    cos_phi = (pz - B * math.cos(theta1)) / A
    
    # Ensure sin^2 + cos^2 = 1 to avoid invalid values
    magnitude = math.sqrt(sin_phi**2 + cos_phi**2)
    if magnitude > 1:
        sin_phi /= magnitude
        cos_phi /= magnitude
    
    phi = math.atan2(sin_phi, cos_phi)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = phi - theta1
    
    # Calculate theta3 based on the desired orientation
    theta3 = r[1] - theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Position Equations**: The TCP's position is derived from the cumulative transformations of the joints. The x and y positions are functions of the sum of the joint angles, while the z position is fixed.
2. **Orientation Equation**: The orientation is determined by the sum of the joint angles, as all rotations are about the Y-axis.
3. **Solving for Joint Angles**: Using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulation, we solve for the joint angles. The solution involves calculating intermediate variables to isolate each joint angle step by step, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation.

This approach provides a closed-form analytical solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the given 3-DOF robot arm.
