To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a step-by-step approach, building upon the existing solutions for subsets of the problem. Here's how we can extend the solution to include all four joints:

1. **Solve for θ1 (Joint 1):** Use the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane to find θ1.
2. **Adjust the Target:** Subtract the contribution of Joint 1 and the offset of Joint 2.
3. **Solve for θ2 and θ3 (Joints 2 and 3):** Use the adjusted target to find θ2 and θ3 together.
4. **Adjust the Target Again:** Subtract the contribution of Joint 3 and the offset of Joint 4.
5. **Solve for θ4 (Joint 4):** Use the final adjusted target to find θ4, considering the Z-axis rotation.

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the projection onto X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the target by subtracting the contribution of Joint 1 and Joint 2's offset
    adjusted_x = x - 0.1197 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z + 0.425 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 together
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Adjust the target again by subtracting the contribution of Joint 3 and Joint 4's offset
    adjusted_x_2 = adjusted_x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta2)
    adjusted_z_2 = adjusted_z + 0.093 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_x_2, adjusted_z_2)
    
    # Finally, solve for theta4 considering the Z-axis rotation
    theta4 = math.atan2(y, 0.09465)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates each joint angle step by step, adjusting the target position at each stage to account for the contributions of the previously solved joints. The solution assumes the target is reachable and uses basic trigonometric functions to find each angle.
