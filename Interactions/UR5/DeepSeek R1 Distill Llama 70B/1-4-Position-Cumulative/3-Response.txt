To address the inaccuraciesin the inverse kinematics solution, a more comprehensive approach is necessary. The step-by-step method initially used was overly simplistic and did not account for the full kinematic chain and joint interactions. Here's a refined solution using the Jacobian inverse method to accurately solve for all four joints:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" using the Jacobian inverse method.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".

**Explanation:**

1. **Jacobian Inverse Method:** This approach calculates the Jacobian matrix, which relates the joint velocities to the end effector velocities. By inverting this matrix, we can determine the necessary joint movements to reach the target position.

2. **Forward Kinematics:** This function calculates the current position of the end effector based on the joint angles. It applies the transformation matrices for each joint to determine the final position.

3. **Transformation Matrices:** These matrices represent the rotations around each joint's axis. They are used to compute the overall transformation from the base to the end effector.

4. **Jacobian Matrix Calculation:** The Jacobian matrix is computed by taking the partial derivatives of the end effector position with respect to each joint angle. This involves differentiating the transformation matrices for each joint.

5. **Iterative Update:** The joint angles are updated iteratively using the Jacobian inverse until the error between the current and target positions is within an acceptable tolerance.

This method provides a more accurate solution by considering the full kinematic chain and the interactions between all joints, leading to better convergence to the target position.
