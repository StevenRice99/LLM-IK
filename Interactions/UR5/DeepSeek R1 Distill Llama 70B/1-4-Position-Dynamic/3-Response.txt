To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach:

1. **Model the Kinematic Chain**: Define each link using DH parameters.
2. **Forward Kinematics**: Express the TCP position in terms of joint angles.
3. **Inverse Kinematics**: Solve for joint angles given a desired TCP position.

Here's the Python function implementing the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Calculates the joint angles needed to reach the specified TCP position.
    :param p: The target position [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of four joint angles in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Solve for joint 2
    theta2 = 0.0  # Placeholder, needs to be calculated based on y and z

    # Solve for joint 3 and 4
    # Using the existing solution for joints 3 and 4
    theta3, theta4 = inverse_kinematics_joints3_4((x, y, z))

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)

def inverse_kinematics_joints3_4(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Solves for joints 3 and 4 given the target position.
    :param p: The target position [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of two joint angles in radians.
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    theta3 = 0.0  # Placeholder, needs to be calculated
    theta4 = 0.0  # Placeholder, needs to be calculated
    return (theta3, theta4)
```

This function provides a structured approach to solving the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable parts, allowing for step-by-step solution development.
