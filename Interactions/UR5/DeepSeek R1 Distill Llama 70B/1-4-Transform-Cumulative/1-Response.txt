To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach using the provided existing solutions as a foundation and extend them to handle all four joints. The goal is to determine the joint angles that achieve the desired TCP position and orientation.

### Approach
1. **Model Forward Kinematics:** Represent each joint's transformation matrix, considering their rotational axes and link positions. This allows us to express the TCP's position and orientation in terms of the joint angles.
2. **Set Up Equations:** Equate the forward kinematics expressions to the desired position and orientation, resulting in a system of equations.
3. **Solve the System:** Use algebraic methods to solve for the joint angles. This involves solving for each joint sequentially, using the solutions from previous joints to adjust subsequent calculations.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    
    # Solve for joint 1 using the existing solution
    q1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
    
    # Adjust the position for joint 2
    x = p[0] - 0.093 * math.cos(q1)
    z = p[2] + 0.093 * math.sin(q1)
    q2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the position for joint 3
    x = x - 0.425 * math.cos(q2)
    z = z + 0.425 * math.sin(q2)
    q3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint 4 using the existing solution
    q4 = math.atan2(r[1], r[0])
    
    return (q1, q2, q3, q4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint 1 (q1):** Using the existing solution, we determine q1 by calculating the angle needed to align the base joint with the target position in the x-z plane.
2. **Joint 2 (q2):** After adjusting the target position based on q1, we solve for q2 to align the second joint.
3. **Joint 3 (q3):** Further adjusting the target position based on q2, we solve for q3 to align the third joint.
4. **Joint 4 (q4):** Finally, using the existing solution for the fourth joint, we solve for q4 to achieve the desired orientation.

This approach sequentially solves for each joint, considering the contributions of previous joints, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired pose.
