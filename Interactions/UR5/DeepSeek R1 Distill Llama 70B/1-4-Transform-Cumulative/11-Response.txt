To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we will follow a systematic approach, solving for each joint angle sequentially while adjusting the target position and orientation accordingly. Here's the detailed solution:

### Approach
1. **Solve for Joint 1 (q1):** Use the existing solution to determine the angle for the first joint based on the target position's x and z coordinates. This aligns the base joint with the target position in the x-z plane.

2. **Adjust the Target for Joint 2:** After determining q1, adjust the target position by subtracting the displacement caused by Joint 1. This gives the effective target position for Joint 2.

3. **Solve for Joint 2 (q2):** Using the adjusted target position, determine the angle for Joint 2 similarly by taking the arctangent of the adjusted x and z coordinates.

4. **Adjust the Target for Joint 3:** Subtract the contributions of Joints 1 and 2 from the target position to get the effective target position for Joint 3.

5. **Solve for Joint 3 (q3):** Use the adjusted target position to determine the angle for Joint 3.

6. **Adjust the Target for Joint 4:** Subtract the contributions of Joints 1, 2, and 3 from the target orientation to get the effective target orientation for Joint 4.

7. **Solve for Joint 4 (q4):** Use the existing solution to determine the angle for Joint 4 based on the remaining orientation.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    
    # Solve for joint 1 using the existing solution
    q1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
    
    # Adjust the position for joint 2
    x = p[0] - 0.093 * math.cos(q1)
    z = p[2] + 0.093 * math.sin(q1)
    q2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the position for joint 3
    x = x - 0.425 * math.cos(q2)
    z = z + 0.425 * math.sin(q2)
    q3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint 4 using the existing solution
    q4 = math.atan2(r[1], r[0])
    
    return (q1, q2, q3, q4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint 1 (q1):** The angle for the first joint is determined using the arctangent of the target position's x and z coordinates. This aligns the base joint with the target position in the x-z plane.

2. **Adjusting for Joint 2:** After determining q1, the target position is adjusted by subtracting the displacement caused by Joint 1. This gives the effective target position for Joint 2.

3. **Joint 2 (q2):** Using the adjusted target position, the angle for Joint 2 is found similarly by taking the arctangent of the adjusted x and z coordinates.

4. **Adjusting for Joint 3:** The target position is further adjusted by subtracting the displacement caused by Joint 2, providing the effective target position for Joint 3.

5. **Joint 3 (q3):** The angle for Joint 3 is determined using the adjusted target position, ensuring the third joint aligns correctly.

6. **Adjusting for Joint 4:** The remaining orientation is used to solve for Joint 4, ensuring the TCP achieves the desired orientation.

This sequential approach ensures that each joint's contribution is accounted for, leading to the correct joint angles that achieve the desired TCP pose.
