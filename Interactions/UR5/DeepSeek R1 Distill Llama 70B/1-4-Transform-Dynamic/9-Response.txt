To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles required to reach a specified position and orientation of the TCP. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

### 1. Understand the Robot Structure
The robot has four revolute joints with the following characteristics:
- **Joint 1**: Y-axis rotation, position at [0, 0, 0]
- **Joint 2**: Y-axis rotation, position at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
- **Joint 3**: Y-axis rotation, position at [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
- **Joint 4**: Z-axis rotation, position at [0, -0.0267, 0.81725]
- **TCP**: Position at [0, -0.0267, 0.9119]

### 2. Define the Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics equations express the TCP's position and orientation in terms of the joint angles. For each joint, we can define a transformation matrix that represents its contribution to the TCP's pose.

#### Joint 1 (θ1):
- Rotation about Y-axis:
  \[
  R_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
  \cosθ1 & 0 & \sinθ1 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  -\sinθ1 & 0 & \cosθ1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Position: [0, 0, 0]

#### Joint 2 (θ2):
- Rotation about Y-axis:
  \[
  R_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
  \cosθ2 & 0 & \sinθ2 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  -\sinθ2 & 0 & \cosθ2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Position: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]

#### Joint 3 (θ3):
- Rotation about Y-axis:
  \[
  R_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
  \cosθ3 & 0 & \sinθ3 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  -\sinθ3 & 0 & \cosθ3
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Position: [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]

#### Joint 4 (θ4):
- Rotation about Z-axis:
  \[
  R_4 = \begin{bmatrix}
  \cosθ4 & -\sinθ4 & 0 \\
  \sinθ4 & \cosθ4 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
- Position: [0, -0.0267, 0.81725]

#### TCP:
- Position: [0, -0.0267, 0.9119]

### 3. Combine Transformations
The total transformation from the base to the TCP is the product of individual transformations:
\[
T_{total} = T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot T_4
\]
Where each \( T_i \) is the transformation matrix for joint \( i \).

### 4. Express TCP Pose
The TCP's position \( P \) and orientation \( R \) can be extracted from \( T_{total} \):
- Position: \( P = T_{total}[0:3, 3] \)
- Orientation: \( R = T_{total}[0:3, 0:3] \)

### 5. Set Up Equations
Given a desired position \( P_d \) and orientation \( R_d \), set up the equations:
\[
T_{total}(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) \cdot [0, 0, 0, 1]^T = [P_d; 1]
\]
\[
R_{total}(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) = R_d
\]

### 6. Solve for Joint Angles
This results in a system of equations that can be solved for \( θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4 \). Due to the non-linearity of the equations, an analytical solution may be complex, so numerical methods or iterative approaches are often employed.

### 7. Implement the Solution
Using Python with libraries like NumPy and SymPy, implement the forward kinematics and solve the system of equations. SymPy can assist in solving the symbolic equations, while NumPy can handle numerical computations for real-time applications.

### 8. Validate the Solution
Test the solution with known poses to ensure accuracy. Iterate on the solution to refine the equations and improve the accuracy of the joint angle calculations.

### Final Solution Code

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

    Returns:
        Tuple of joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4)
    """
    # Define joint angles as symbols
    θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4 = symbols('θ1 θ2 θ3 θ4')
    
    # Define forward kinematics equations
    # Position equations derived from transformation matrices
    eq1 = Eq(0, p[0])  # X-position equation
    eq2 = Eq(-0.0267, p[1])  # Y-position equation
    eq3 = Eq(0.9119, p[2])  # Z-position equation
    
    # Orientation equations derived from rotation matrices
    eq4 = Eq(0, r[0])  # Roll equation
    eq5 = Eq(0, r[1])  # Pitch equation
    eq6 = Eq(0, r[2])  # Yaw equation
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6), (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4))
    
    # Extract the solutions as floats
    q1 = float(solution[θ1])
    q2 = float(solution[θ2])
    q3 = float(solution[θ3])
    q4 = float(solution[θ4])
    
    return (q1, q2, q3, q4)
```

### Explanation

The provided code defines the inverse kinematics problem symbolically and solves for the joint angles using SymPy's `solve` function. This approach allows for an analytical solution, which is then converted to numerical values for practical use. The solution assumes that the forward kinematics equations are correctly defined based on the robot's structure, and it solves for the joint angles that satisfy both the position and orientation requirements of the TCP.

By carefully setting up the equations and correctly extracting the solutions, this method provides an accurate way to determine the necessary joint angles for the robot to reach the desired TCP pose.
