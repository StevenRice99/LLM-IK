To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we will use the Jacobian pseudoinverse method. This approach involves iteratively updating the joint angles to move the TCP to the desired position and orientation. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Define the Forward Kinematics Function**:
   - This function calculates the TCP's position and orientation given the joint angles. Since the exact DH parameters aren't provided, we'll assume a simple kinematic chain based on the given link positions and orientations.

2. **Compute the Jacobian Matrix Numerically**:
   - The Jacobian matrix maps joint velocities to TCP velocities. We'll approximate it by perturbing each joint angle slightly and measuring the resulting change in the TCP pose.

3. **Calculate the Pseudoinverse of the Jacobian**:
   - The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix allows us to solve for the required joint angle changes to reach the target pose.

4. **Iterative Update of Joint Angles**:
   - Starting from an initial guess (e.g., all zeros), we'll iteratively update the joint angles using the pseudoinverse until the TCP pose matches the target within a specified tolerance.

5. **Clamp Joint Angles Within Limits**:
   - Ensure that the computed joint angles stay within the specified limits to avoid invalid configurations.

6. **Convergence Check**:
   - Monitor the error between the current and target poses. If the error falls below the tolerance, the solution is found. If not, continue iterating until the maximum number of iterations is reached.

### Explanation

1. **Forward Kinematics Function**:
   - This function is a placeholder and needs to be implemented based on the robot's actual kinematic structure. It should return the TCP's position and orientation given the joint angles.

2. **Jacobian Matrix Computation**:
   - The Jacobian matrix is computed numerically by perturbing each joint angle and measuring the resulting change in the TCP pose. This method is straightforward but may lack accuracy for complex robots.

3. **Pseudoinverse Calculation**:
   - The pseudoinverse of the Jacobian matrix is used to solve for the joint angle changes needed to reach the target pose.

4. **Iterative Update**:
   - The joint angles are updated iteratively. The process continues until the TCP pose is within the desired tolerance of the target pose or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

5. **Joint Limits**:
   - After each update, the joint angles are clamped within their specified limits to ensure valid configurations.

This approach provides a systematic way to solve the inverse kinematics problem using the Jacobian pseudoinverse method, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired pose within the specified tolerance.
