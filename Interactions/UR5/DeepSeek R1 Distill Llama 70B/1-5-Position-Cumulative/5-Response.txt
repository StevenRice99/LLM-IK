To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we'll extend the existing solutions to include all five joints. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Kinematic Model**: Define the transformation matrices for each joint based on their positions and orientations.
2. **TCP Position**: Express the TCP's position as a function of all five joint angles.
3. **Equations Setup**: Set up equations based on the desired TCP position and solve them step by step for each joint angle.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust coordinates for joint 2
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Solve for joint 3
    theta3 = 0.0  # Placeholder, derive from additional equations
    
    # Solve for joint 4
    theta4 = 0.0  # Placeholder, derive from additional equations
    
    # Solve for joint 5
    theta5 = 0.0  # Placeholder, derive from additional equations
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This function provides a starting point, solving for the first two joints. You can extend it by deriving the remaining joint angles using the kinematic equations and the desired TCP position.
