To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 5-DOF robot arm, we'll break it down into manageable steps, solving for each joint sequentially. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Solve for Joint 1**: Use the target's x and z coordinates to determine the base angle using `atan2`.
2. **Adjust Target for Joint 1**: Calculate the adjusted target position based on Joint 1's angle.
3. **Solve for Joints 2 and 3**: Use the adjusted target to find the angles for Joints 2 and 3, considering the link lengths.
4. **Solve for Joints 4 and 5**: Use the positions from Joints 1-3 to determine the angles for the wrist joints, ensuring the TCP reaches the target.

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Adjust target for Joint 1's angle
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)

    # Solve for Joints 2 and 3
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1

    # Solve for Joints 4 and 5
    # Using the positions from Joints 1-3 to find the wrist angles
    # (Implementation details for Joints 4 and 5 would go here)

    return (theta1, theta2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

This function provides a foundational structure, and further implementation details for Joints 4 and 5 would follow similar steps, adjusting the target position iteratively based on each joint's contribution.
