To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a structured approach:

1. **Model the Robot**: Use Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters to model each link and joint, defining the kinematic chain.

2. **Express TCP Pose**: Compute the transformation matrices from the base to the TCP, expressing its position and orientation in terms of joint angles.

3. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the computed TCP pose to the desired pose, resulting in a system of equations.

4. **Solve the System**: Use SymPy to solve the system of equations for the joint angles.

5. **Implement the Solution**: Translate the derived equations into the provided Python function.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import math
from typing import Tuple

def inverse_kinematics(p: Tuple[float, float, float], r: Tuple[float, float, float]) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Solves for the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation.
    
    Args:
        p: The desired position (x, y, z).
        r: The desired orientation as Euler angles (rx, ry, rz).
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of five joint angles in radians.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Solve for joint 1 using the existing solution
    x, y, z = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for joint 2 using the existing solution
    theta2 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 3: Solve for joint 3 using the existing solution
    px, py, pz = p
    theta3 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Step 4: Solve for joint 4 using the existing solution
    theta4 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 5: Solve for joint 5 using the existing solution
    theta5 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This function combines the existing solutions for each joint to compute all five joint angles required to reach the desired TCP pose. Each step uses the position and orientation to solve for the respective joint angle, ensuring the TCP reaches the target.
