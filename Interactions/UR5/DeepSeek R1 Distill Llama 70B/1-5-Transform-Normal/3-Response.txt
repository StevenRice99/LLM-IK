To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 5-DOF robot arm, we'll follow a systematic approach using Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters and transformation matrices. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Define DH Parameters

Based on the provided details, we define the DH parameters for each joint:

| Link | Joint | a (m) | α (rad) | d (m) | θ (rad) |
|------|-------|-------|---------|-------|---------|
| 1    | 1     | 0     | π/2     | 0     | q1      |
| 2    | 2     | 0.425 | 0       | -0.1197 | q2      |
| 3    | 3     | 0.39225 | 0       | 0     | q3      |
| 4    | 4     | 0     | π/2     | 0.093 | q4      |
| 5    | 5     | 0.09465 | 0       | 0     | q5      |

### Step 2: Construct Transformation Matrices

Each joint's transformation matrix \( T_i \) is constructed using the DH parameters:

\[
T_i = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta_i & -\sin\theta_i\cos\alpha_i & \sin\theta_i\sin\alpha_i & a_i\cos\theta_i \\
\sin\theta_i & \cos\theta_i\cos\alpha_i & -\cos\theta_i\sin\alpha_i & a_i\sin\theta_i \\
0 & \sin\alpha_i & \cos\alpha_i & d_i \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Compute Total Transformation

Multiply the transformation matrices from joint 1 to joint 5 to get the total transformation from the base to the TCP:

\[
T_{total} = T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot T_4 \cdot T_5
\]

### Step 4: Set Up Desired Transformation

The desired transformation \( T_{desired} \) is composed of the desired position \( p \) and orientation \( r \). The orientation can be represented as a rotation matrix \( R \), and the position as a translation vector.

\[
T_{desired} = \begin{bmatrix}
R & p \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Equate Transformations

Set \( T_{total} = T_{desired} \) and solve for the joint angles \( q1 \) to \( q5 \). This results in a system of equations that can be solved analytically or numerically.

### Step 6: Solve for Joint Angles

Using the equations derived from the transformation equality, solve for each joint angle. Ensure the solutions fall within the specified joint limits.

### Step 7: Implement the Solution

Implement the derived equations in the `inverse_kinematics` function to compute the joint angles for any given position and orientation.

### Final Answer

The inverse kinematics solution involves calculating the joint angles using the DH parameters and transformation matrices. By systematically equating the total transformation to the desired pose, we derive the necessary joint angles to reach the target position and orientation.

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    # Implement the inverse kinematics solution here
    # Using the steps above, calculate q1 to q5
    # Return the joint angles as a tuple
    pass
```
