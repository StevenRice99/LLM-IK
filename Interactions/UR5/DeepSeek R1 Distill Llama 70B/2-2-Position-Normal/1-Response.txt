To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the given 1-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle Î¸ that positions the TCP at the desired coordinates. The TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane with a radius of 0.39225 meters. Using trigonometric relationships, we can derive the joint angle using the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of x and z
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)
    return theta
```
