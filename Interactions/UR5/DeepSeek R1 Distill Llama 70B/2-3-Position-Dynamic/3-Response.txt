To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate theta1**: Use the arctangent of the target's x and z coordinates to determine the angle for the first joint.
2. **Adjust the target position**: Subtract the contribution of the first joint from the target position to isolate the second joint's contribution.
3. **Calculate theta_total**: Determine the combined angle for both joints using the adjusted target position.
4. **Calculate theta2**: Subtract theta1 from theta_total to find the angle for the second joint.

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctan2 of x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the target position by subtracting the contribution from joint1
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta_total using arctan2 of adjusted_x and adjusted_z
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Calculate theta2 by subtracting theta1 from theta_total
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function first determines the angle for the first joint using the arctangent of the target's x and z coordinates. It then adjusts the target position to account for the first joint's contribution and calculates the combined angle for both joints. Finally, it finds the second joint's angle by subtracting the first joint's angle from the combined angle. This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position accurately.
