To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we can break down the problem into solving for each joint angle using the given target position. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The first joint is at the origin, and the second joint is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]. The TCP is offset from the second joint by [0, 0.093, 0].

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - The position of the second joint in the world frame is determined by the first joint angle (θ1).
   - The TCP's position is influenced by both θ1 and the second joint angle (θ2).

3. **Solve for θ2**:
   - From the Y-component of the target position, solve for θ2 using the arccosine function.

4. **Solve for θ1**:
   - From the Z-component of the target position, solve for θ1 using the arcsine function.

5. **Verify Consistency**:
   - Ensure that the computed angles result in the correct X-component of the target position.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2 from the y-component
    cos_theta2 = y / 0.093
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 from the z-component
    sin_theta1 = z / 0.39225
    theta1 = math.asin(sin_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function computes the necessary joint angles to reach the specified target position, considering the geometric constraints of the manipulator.
