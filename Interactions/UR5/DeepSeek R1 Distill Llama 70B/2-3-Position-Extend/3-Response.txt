To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we focus on determining the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location. Given the structure, the second joint does not affect the TCP's position, so we only need to solve for the first joint angle.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Robot Structure:**
   - **Joint 1:** Revolute joint at the base, rotating around the Y-axis.
   - **Joint 2:** Revolute joint above Joint 1, also rotating around the Y-axis.
   - **TCP:** Located at a fixed offset from Joint 2, specifically [0, 0.093, 0].

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - The position of the TCP in the world frame is determined by the rotation of Joint 1 and the fixed offset from Joint 2.
   - The rotation matrix for Joint 1 (R(theta1)) transforms the TCP's position from Joint 2's frame to the world frame.

3. **TCP Position Equations:**
   - After applying the rotation matrix, the TCP's position in the world frame is:
     - x = -0.093 * sin(theta1)
     - y = 0.093 (fixed)
     - z = 0.39225 * cos(theta1)

4. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Given a desired position (x, y, z), we solve for theta1 using the x and z components.
   - Since y is fixed at 0.093, we don't need to solve for theta2, which can be set to zero.

5. **Implementation:**
   - Calculate theta1 using the arctangent of x and z.
   - Return theta1 and 0.0 for theta2.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Since y is fixed at 0.093, we only need to solve for theta1 using x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    # Theta2 can be set to 0 as it doesn't affect the TCP position
    theta2 = 0.0
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution effectively determines the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, considering the constraints and structure of the manipulator.
