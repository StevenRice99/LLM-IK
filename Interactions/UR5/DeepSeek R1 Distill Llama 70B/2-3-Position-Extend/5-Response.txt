To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Kinematic Structure:**
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis.
   - The first joint (q1) is at the base, and the second joint (q2) is attached to the first link.
   - The TCP is offset by 0.093 units along the Y-axis from the second joint.

2. **Formulate the Kinematic Equations:**
   - Using the law of cosines and sines, derive the equations for the TCP's position in terms of q1 and q2.

3. **Derive the Equations:**
   - Express the TCP's x and z coordinates in terms of q1 and q2.
   - Combine the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the sum of the angles (θ = q1 + q2).

4. **Solve for θ:**
   - Use trigonometric identities to solve for θ, considering the geometric constraints.

5. **Determine Individual Joint Angles:**
   - Once θ is known, solve for q1 using the derived equations and then find q2 as θ - q1.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link

    # Calculate the necessary terms for solving theta
    A = x**2 + z**2 - L1**2 - L2**2
    B = (L1**2 + L2**2 - x**2 - z**2) / (2 * L2)
    R = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    phi = math.atan2(z, x)

    # Calculate the two possible solutions for theta
    theta1 = math.asin(B / R) - phi
    theta2 = math.pi - math.asin(B / R) - phi

    solutions = []

    for theta in [theta1, theta2]:
        # Calculate sin and cos of q1
        sin_q1 = (x - L2 * math.sin(theta)) / L1
        cos_q1 = (z - L2 * math.cos(theta)) / L1

        # Check if the values are within valid range
        if abs(sin_q1**2 + cos_q1**2 - 1.0) > 1e-6:
            continue  # Skip invalid solution

        q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)
        q2 = theta - q1

        solutions.append((q1, q2))

    # Return the first valid solution
    if solutions:
        return solutions[0]
    else:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
```

This code calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates by solving the inverse kinematics equations. It considers both possible geometric solutions and returns the first valid pair of joint angles.
