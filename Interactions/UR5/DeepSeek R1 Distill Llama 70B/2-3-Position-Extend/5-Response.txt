To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that will position the TCP at the desired target position. The approach involves solving for θ1 and θ2 using the geometric relationships derived from the robot's structure.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The first joint is at the origin, and the second joint is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]. The TCP is offset from the second joint by [0, 0.093, 0].

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - The position of the second joint in the world frame is determined by the first joint angle (θ1).
   - The TCP's position is influenced by both θ1 and the second joint angle (θ2).

3. **Calculate θ1**:
   - Use the z-component of the target position to find cos(θ1).
   - Use the derived formula to find sin(θ1) based on the target position components.
   - Compute θ1 using the arctangent function.

4. **Calculate θ2**:
   - Use the y-component of the target position to find cos(θ2).
   - Compute θ2 using the arccosine function.

5. **Verify Consistency**:
   - Ensure that the computed angles result in the correct x-component of the target position.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.093    # Offset of the TCP from the second link
    
    # Calculate sin(theta1) using the derived formula
    numerator = (A**2 + x**2 + y**2 - B**2 - z**2)
    denominator = 2 * A * x
    if denominator == 0:
        # Handle division by zero if x is zero
        sin_theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        sin_theta1 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Calculate cos(theta1) from z
    cos_theta1 = z / A
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctan2 to get the correct quadrant
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2 from y
    cos_theta2 = y / B
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
The provided code calculates the necessary joint angles θ1 and θ2 to position the TCP at the target position [x, y, z]. It uses the geometric relationships and trigonometric identities to solve for the angles, ensuring that the solution is consistent with the robot's structure and movement constraints. This approach efficiently determines the joint angles without the need for optimization methods, providing an accurate solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
