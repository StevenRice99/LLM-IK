To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired coordinates. The approach involves setting up the kinematic equations based on the geometric configuration and solving them using trigonometric identities.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Kinematic Structure:**
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis.
   - The first joint (q1) moves the second joint in a circular path in the x-z plane.
   - The second joint (q2) moves the TCP in another circular path, also in the x-z plane, starting from the position of the second joint.

2. **Formulate the Kinematic Equations:**
   - Using the law of cosines and sines, derive the equations for the TCP's position in terms of q1 and q2.

3. **Derive the Equations:**
   - Express the TCP's x and z coordinates in terms of q1 and q2.
   - Combine the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the sum of the angles (θ = q1 + q2).

4. **Solve for θ:**
   - Use trigonometric identities to solve for θ, considering the geometric constraints.

5. **Determine Individual Joint Angles:**
   - Once θ is known, solve for q1 using the derived equations and then find q2 as θ - q1.

### Solution Code

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link

    # Calculate R and phi
    R = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    phi = math.atan2(z, x)

    # Calculate A
    A = (x**2 + z**2 + L2**2 - L1**2) / (2 * L2)

    # Check if A is within valid range
    if abs(A) > 1.0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)  # No solution

    # Calculate theta
    theta1 = phi + math.acos(A / R)
    theta2 = phi - math.acos(A / R)

    solutions = []

    for theta in [theta1, theta2]:
        # Calculate q1
        cos_q1 = (x - L2 * math.cos(theta)) / L1
        sin_q1 = (z - L2 * math.sin(theta)) / L1

        # Check if cos_q1 and sin_q1 are valid
        if abs(cos_q1**2 + sin_q1**2 - 1.0) > 1e-6:
            continue  # Skip invalid solution

        q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)
        q2 = theta - q1

        solutions.append((q1, q2))

    # Return the first valid solution
    if solutions:
        return solutions[0]
    else:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate R and Phi:**
   - `R` is the distance from the origin to the TCP position in the x-z plane.
   - `phi` is the angle from the x-axis to the TCP position.

2. **Calculate A:**
   - `A` is derived from the law of cosines and represents a term used to solve for θ.

3. **Solve for Theta:**
   - Two possible solutions for θ are calculated using the arccosine function.

4. **Calculate Joint Angles:**
   - For each θ, compute q1 using the arctangent of the ratio of the sine and cosine terms.
   - Compute q2 as the difference between θ and q1.

5. **Return the Solution:**
   - The first valid solution is returned. If no valid solution is found, default angles of (0.0, 0.0) are returned.

This approach ensures that the manipulator's joints are positioned to reach the desired TCP location accurately.
