To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at a desired location. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

### Approach
1. **Understand the Kinematic Structure:**
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis.
   - The first joint (q1) is at the base, and the second joint (q2) is attached to the end of the first link.
   - The TCP is offset by 0.093 units along the Y-axis from the second joint.

2. **Formulate the Kinematic Equations:**
   - Using the law of cosines and sines, derive the equations for the TCP's position in terms of q1 and q2.

3. **Derive the Equations:**
   - Express the TCP's x and z coordinates in terms of q1 and q2.
   - Combine the equations to eliminate one variable and solve for the sum of the angles (θ = q1 + q2).

4. **Solve for θ:**
   - Use trigonometric identities to solve for θ, considering the geometric constraints.

5. **Determine Individual Joint Angles:**
   - Once θ is known, solve for q1 using the derived equations and then find q2 as θ - q1.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link

    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the x-z plane
    R = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if R < abs(L1 - L2) or R > (L1 + L2):
        return (0.0, 0.0)  # Target is not reachable

    # Calculate A and c
    A = x**2 + z**2 + L1**2 - L2**2
    c = A / (2 * L1 * R)

    # Check if c is within valid range for cosine
    if abs(c) > 1.0:
        return (0.0, 0.0)  # No solution exists

    # Calculate phi
    phi = math.atan2(z, x)

    # Calculate theta1 and theta2
    theta1 = phi + math.acos(c)
    theta2 = phi - math.acos(c)

    solutions = []

    for theta in [theta1, theta2]:
        # Calculate q1
        cos_q1 = (x - L2 * math.cos(theta)) / L1
        sin_q1 = (z - L2 * math.sin(theta)) / L1

        # Check if cos_q1 and sin_q1 are valid
        if abs(cos_q1**2 + sin_q1**2 - 1.0) > 1e-6:
            continue  # Skip invalid solution

        q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)
        q2 = theta - q1

        solutions.append((q1, q2))

    # Return the first valid solution
    if solutions:
        return solutions[0]
    else:
        return (0.0, 0.0)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate the Distance (R):**
   - Compute the distance from the origin to the TCP in the x-z plane using the Pythagorean theorem.

2. **Check Reachability:**
   - Ensure the target position is within the manipulator's reachable range, defined by the sum and difference of the link lengths.

3. **Calculate A and c:**
   - Derive the terms needed to solve for the joint angles using the law of cosines.

4. **Solve for Theta:**
   - Use the arccosine function to find potential solutions for the angle θ, which is the sum of q1 and q2.

5. **Determine Joint Angles:**
   - For each potential θ, calculate q1 and q2, ensuring the solutions are valid and within the expected range.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by leveraging geometric relationships and trigonometric identities, ensuring accurate and valid joint angles for the manipulator.
