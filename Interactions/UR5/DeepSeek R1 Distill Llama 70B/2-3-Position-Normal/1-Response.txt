To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Extract the target position**: The target position `p` is given as a tuple `(x, y, z)`. Since the robot can only move in the X-Z plane, we focus on `x` and `z`.

2. **Define the link lengths**: The first link (L1) is 0.39225 meters, and the second link (L2) is 0.093 meters.

3. **Calculate `cos(q2)`**: Using the formula derived from the law of cosines, we find `cos(q2)`.

4. **Determine `sin(q2)`**: Using the Pythagorean identity, we find `sin(q2)`, assuming it's positive for simplicity.

5. **Compute intermediate terms**: Calculate `C` and `D` using `cos(q2)` and `sin(q2)`.

6. **Solve for `sin(q1)` and `cos(q1)`**: Using the derived equations, compute the sine and cosine of the first joint angle.

7. **Find `q1` and `q2`**: Use the `atan2` function to determine the joint angles from their sine and cosine values.

Here is the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.093    # Length of the second link

    # Calculate cos(q2)
    x_sq_plus_z_sq = x**2 + z**2
    numerator = x_sq_plus_z_sq - A**2 - B**2
    denominator = 2 * A * B
    cos_q2 = numerator / denominator

    # Clamp cos_q2 to the valid range to avoid numerical issues
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)
    sin_q2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_q2**2)  # Assuming positive sin_q2

    # Calculate C and D
    C = A + B * cos_q2
    D = B * sin_q2

    # Calculate sin(q1) and cos(q1)
    denominator_ud = C**2 + D**2
    if denominator_ud == 0:
        # This case should not occur as per the problem statement
        raise ValueError("Denominator is zero, which should not happen for a reachable target.")
    sin_q1 = (C * x - D * z) / denominator_ud
    cos_q1 = (D * x + C * z) / denominator_ud

    # Ensure sin_q1 and cos_q1 are valid (due to floating-point precision)
    sin_q1 = max(min(sin_q1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cos_q1 = max(min(cos_q1, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate q1 using atan2
    q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)

    # Calculate q2 using atan2
    q2 = math.atan2(sin_q2, cos_q2)

    return (q1, q2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles `q1` and `q2` to move the TCP to the desired position `p`. It uses geometric relationships and trigonometric identities to solve the inverse kinematics problem efficiently.
