To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Extract the target position**: The target position `p` is given as `(p_x, p_y, p_z)`. Since the TCP's Y position is fixed at 0.093, we only need to consider `p_x` and `p_z`.

2. **Define constants**: The lengths of the links are `A = 0.39225` and `B = 0.093`.

3. **Compute the magnitude and angle**: Calculate `M` as the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane and `phi` as the angle of the target position relative to the X-axis.

4. **Calculate intermediate terms**: Compute `K` using the given formula, which relates the target position to the link lengths.

5. **Solve for theta1**: Using the sine of the difference of angles, find `theta1` by adjusting `phi` with the computed angle.

6. **Determine theta2**: Using the values of `theta1`, compute `sin(theta2)` and `cos(theta2)` from the original equations and find `theta2` using `atan2` to ensure the correct quadrant.

Here is the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    p_x, _, p_z = p  # p_y is fixed at 0.093 and can be ignored
    A = 0.39225
    B = 0.093

    # Calculate the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane
    M = math.sqrt(p_x ** 2 + p_z ** 2)
    if M == 0:
        # If the target is at the origin in X-Z, handle separately
        theta1 = 0.0
        theta2 = 0.0
        return (theta1, theta2)

    # Calculate the angle phi from the target position
    phi = math.atan2(p_z, p_x)

    # Calculate K for the sine term
    K = (B ** 2 - p_x ** 2 - p_z ** 2 - A ** 2) / (2 * A)

    # Calculate sin(theta1 - phi)
    sin_theta1_minus_phi = K / M

    # Ensure the value is within the valid range for arcsin
    sin_theta1_minus_phi = max(min(sin_theta1_minus_phi, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1_minus_phi = math.asin(sin_theta1_minus_phi)
    theta1 = phi + theta1_minus_phi

    # Calculate sin(theta2) and cos(theta2) using the original equations
    sin_theta2 = (-p_x - A * math.sin(theta1)) / B
    cos_theta2 = (p_z - A * math.cos(theta1)) / B

    # Use atan2 to get theta2 in the correct quadrant
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` to position the TCP at the desired coordinates `p`. It uses geometric and trigonometric relationships to derive an analytical solution, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position accurately.
