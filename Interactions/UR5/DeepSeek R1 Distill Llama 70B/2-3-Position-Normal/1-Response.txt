To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) that position the TCP at the desired coordinates \( p = (x, y, z) \). Given the structure of the robot, the TCP's Y position is fixed at 0.093 meters, so we focus on the X and Z components.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis. The first link is 0.39225 meters, and the second link is 0.093 meters. The TCP is offset by 0.093 meters along the Y-axis from the second joint.

2. **Geometric Insight**: The TCP's position in the X-Z plane can be modeled using the law of cosines. The distance \( D \) from the origin to the TCP is calculated, and the angle \( \theta \) is determined using the arctangent of the TCP's position.

3. **Law of Cosines**: Using the distance \( D \), we solve for \( \cos(q_2) \) and subsequently \( q_2 \). The angle \( \theta \) is found using the arctangent of the TCP's X and Z coordinates.

4. **Joint Angles Calculation**: With \( \theta \) and \( q_2 \) known, \( q_1 \) is determined as \( \theta - q_2 \).

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane
    D_squared = x**2 + z**2
    D = math.sqrt(D_squared)

    # Compute cos(q2) using the law of cosines
    numerator = D_squared - L1**2 - L2**2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * L2
    cos_q2 = numerator / denominator
    # Ensure cos_q2 is within valid range to avoid math domain errors
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)
    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)

    # Calculate theta as the angle from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Compute q1
    q1 = theta - q2

    return (q1, q2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Distance Calculation**: The Euclidean distance \( D \) from the origin to the TCP is computed using the X and Z coordinates.
2. **Law of Cosines**: Using \( D \), \( L1 \), and \( L2 \), we solve for \( \cos(q_2) \) and then find \( q_2 \) using the arccosine function.
3. **Angle Calculation**: The angle \( \theta \) is determined using the arctangent of the TCP's X and Z coordinates.
4. **Joint Angle Determination**: The first joint angle \( q_1 \) is found by subtracting \( q_2 \) from \( \theta \).

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position within the robot's reachable workspace.
