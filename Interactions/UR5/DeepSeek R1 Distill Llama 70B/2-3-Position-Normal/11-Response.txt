To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps to compute the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that will position the TCP at the desired target position p.

### Approach
1. **Extract the Target Position**: Focus on the X and Z components of the target position since the Y component is fixed.
2. **Define Constants**: Use the lengths of the links from the URDF.
3. **Calculate the Magnitude M**: Compute the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane.
4. **Handle Special Cases**: If the target is at the origin in the X-Z plane, set both joint angles to zero.
5. **Compute the Angle phi**: Determine the angle of the target position relative to the X-axis using `atan2`.
6. **Calculate K Using the Law of Cosines**: This helps in finding the relationship between the link lengths and the target position.
7. **Find theta1_minus_phi**: Use `arccos` to find the angle difference between theta1 and phi.
8. **Determine theta1**: Add the angle difference to phi.
9. **Calculate sin(theta2) Using the Law of Sines**: Clamp the result to the range [-1, 1].
10. **Calculate cos(theta2)**: Use the Pythagorean identity and ensure the argument is non-negative.
11. **Determine theta2**: Use `atan2` to find theta2 in the correct quadrant.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    p_x, _, p_z = p  # p_y is fixed at 0.093 and can be ignored
    A = 0.39225
    B = 0.093

    # Calculate the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane
    M = math.sqrt(p_x ** 2 + p_z ** 2)
    if M == 0:
        # If the target is at the origin in X-Z, handle separately
        theta1 = 0.0
        theta2 = 0.0
        return (theta1, theta2)

    # Calculate the angle phi from the target position
    phi = math.atan2(p_z, p_x)

    # Calculate K using the law of cosines
    K = (A ** 2 + B ** 2 - M ** 2) / (2 * A * B)

    # Ensure K is within the valid range for arccos
    K = max(min(K, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1_minus_phi = math.acos(K)
    theta1 = phi + theta1_minus_phi

    # Calculate sin(theta2) using the law of sines
    sin_theta2 = (A * math.sin(theta1_minus_phi)) / B

    # Clamp sin_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid invalid values
    sin_theta2 = max(min(sin_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate cos(theta2) and ensure it's non-negative
    cos_theta2 = math.sqrt(max(0, 1 - sin_theta2 ** 2))

    # Use atan2 to get theta2 in the correct quadrant
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Extracting the Target Position**: We focus on the X and Z components since the Y component is fixed at 0.093.
- **Defining Constants**: A and B are the lengths of the links from the URDF.
- **Calculating Magnitude M**: This gives the distance from the origin to the target in the X-Z plane.
- **Handling Special Cases**: If the target is at the origin, both joint angles are set to zero.
- **Computing phi**: This angle helps in determining the direction to the target.
- **Calculating K**: This term relates the link lengths and the target position using the law of cosines.
- **Finding theta1_minus_phi**: This angle difference is crucial for determining theta1.
- **Determining theta1**: Adding the angle difference to phi gives the first joint angle.
- **Calculating sin(theta2)**: Using the law of sines and clamping ensures valid values.
- **Calculating cos(theta2)**: Using the Pythagorean identity avoids invalid square root arguments.
- **Determining theta2**: Using `atan2` ensures the angle is in the correct quadrant.

This approach ensures accurate computation of the joint angles, handling numerical precision issues gracefully and providing the correct positions for the TCP.
