To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (px, pz). Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

### Approach
1. **Calculate the Distance (L):** Compute the distance from the base to the TCP using the Pythagorean theorem in the X-Z plane.
2. **Law of Cosines:** Use the law of cosines to find the angle difference between θ1 and θ2.
3. **Trigonometric Solving:** Express θ1 in terms of θ2 and solve for θ2 using trigonometric identities.
4. **Determine θ1:** Once θ2 is known, calculate θ1 using the angle difference obtained from the law of cosines.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    A = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.093    # Length of the second link (TCP offset)
    p_x, p_y, p_z = p  # Extract the target position
    
    # Calculate the squared distance from the base to the target in the X-Z plane
    L_squared = p_x ** 2 + p_z ** 2
    
    # Compute the cosine of the angle difference between theta1 and theta2
    numerator = L_squared - A ** 2 - B ** 2
    denominator = 2 * A * B
    cos_C = numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else 0.0
    
    # Clamp the value to avoid numerical issues
    cos_C = max(min(cos_C, 1.0), -1.0)
    C = math.acos(cos_C)
    
    # Calculate coefficients for the equation D sin(theta1) - E cos(theta1) = p_x
    D = A + B * math.cos(C)
    E = B * math.sin(C)
    
    # Compute the magnitude of the coefficients
    magnitude = math.sqrt(D ** 2 + E ** 2)
    
    # Handle the case where magnitude is zero to avoid division by zero
    if magnitude < 1e-9:
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        # Calculate the angle delta
        delta = math.atan2(E, D)
        
        # Calculate the sine of the angle for theta1
        sin_theta = p_x / magnitude
        sin_theta = max(min(sin_theta, 1.0), -1.0)
        
        # Calculate theta1 considering the possible solutions
        theta1 = delta + math.asin(sin_theta)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the angle difference C
    theta2 = theta1 - C
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Distance Calculation:** Compute the squared distance from the base to the target in the X-Z plane.
2. **Law of Cosines:** Determine the cosine of the angle difference between θ1 and θ2 using the law of cosines.
3. **Trigonometric Solving:** Use trigonometric identities to express θ1 in terms of the target position and solve for θ1. Then, compute θ2 using the angle difference C.
4. **Handling Edge Cases:** Ensure numerical stability by clamping values and handling potential division by zero.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem, providing the necessary joint angles to reach the desired TCP position.
