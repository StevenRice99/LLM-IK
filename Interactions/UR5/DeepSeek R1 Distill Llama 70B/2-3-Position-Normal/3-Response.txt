To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The first joint is at the origin, and the second joint is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]. The TCP is offset by [0, 0.093, 0] from the second joint.

2. **Define Variables**:
   - \( L1 = 0.39225 \) meters (length from joint1 to joint2)
   - \( L2 = 0.093 \) meters (length from joint2 to TCP)
   - \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are the joint angles.

3. **Express TCP Position**:
   - The TCP position in the Y-Z plane can be described as:
     \[
     Y = L1 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + L2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     Z = L1 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) + L2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]

4. **Law of Cosines**:
   - Using the law of cosines to relate the distances:
     \[
     Y^2 + Z^2 = L1^2 + L2^2 - 2 \cdot L1 \cdot L2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
   - Solve for \( \cos(\theta_2) \):
     \[
     \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{L1^2 + L2^2 - (Y^2 + Z^2)}{2 \cdot L1 \cdot L2}
     \]

5. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Calculate \( \theta_2 \) using the arccosine function.

6. **Express \( \theta_1 \) in Terms of \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Define \( A = L1 + L2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2) \)
   - Define \( B = L2 \cdot \sin(\theta_2) \)
   - Solve the system of equations for \( \sin(\theta_1) \) and \( \cos(\theta_1) \):
     \[
     \sin(\theta_1) = \frac{A \cdot Y - B \cdot Z}{A^2 + B^2}
     \]
     \[
     \cos(\theta_1) = \frac{A \cdot Z + B \cdot Y}{A^2 + B^2}
     \]

7. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - Use the arctangent function to find \( \theta_1 \) from \( \sin(\theta_1) \) and \( \cos(\theta_1) \).

By following these steps, we can analytically determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) needed to position the TCP at the desired coordinates.
