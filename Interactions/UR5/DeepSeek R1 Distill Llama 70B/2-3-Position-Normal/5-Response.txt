To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem accurately, we need to correct the approach based on the law of cosines and properly compute the joint angles. Here's the corrected step-by-step solution:

1. **Extract the Target Position**: We consider the target position `p` in the form `[p_x, p_y, p_z]`. Since the TCP's Y position is fixed at 0.093, we focus on `p_x` and `p_z`.

2. **Define Constants**: 
   - `A = 0.39225` (length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2)
   - `B = 0.093` (length from Revolute 2 to TCP)

3. **Calculate the Magnitude `M`**: Compute the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane.
   \[
   M = \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_z^2}
   \]
   If `M` is zero, set both joint angles to zero.

4. **Compute the Angle `phi`**: Determine the angle of the target position relative to the X-axis using `atan2`.
   \[
   \phi = \text{atan2}(p_z, p_x)
   \]

5. **Calculate `K` Using the Law of Cosines**:
   \[
   K = \frac{A^2 + B^2 - M^2}{2AB}
   \]
   Ensure `K` is within the valid range for `arccos`.

6. **Find `theta1_minus_phi`**:
   \[
   \theta_1 - \phi = \text{arccos}(K)
   \]

7. **Determine `theta1`**:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \phi + (\theta_1 - \phi)
   \]

8. **Calculate `theta2` Using the Law of Sines**:
   \[
   \sin(\theta_2) = \frac{A \cdot \sin(\theta_1 - \phi)}{B}
   \]
   Use `atan2` to find `theta2` in the correct quadrant.

Here is the corrected Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    p_x, _, p_z = p  # p_y is fixed at 0.093 and can be ignored
    A = 0.39225
    B = 0.093

    # Calculate the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane
    M = math.sqrt(p_x ** 2 + p_z ** 2)
    if M == 0:
        # If the target is at the origin in X-Z, handle separately
        theta1 = 0.0
        theta2 = 0.0
        return (theta1, theta2)

    # Calculate the angle phi from the target position
    phi = math.atan2(p_z, p_x)

    # Calculate K using the law of cosines
    K = (A ** 2 + B ** 2 - M ** 2) / (2 * A * B)

    # Ensure K is within the valid range for arccos
    K = max(min(K, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1_minus_phi = math.acos(K)
    theta1 = phi + theta1_minus_phi

    # Calculate sin(theta2) using the law of sines
    sin_theta2 = (A * math.sin(theta1_minus_phi)) / B

    # Use atan2 to get theta2 in the correct quadrant
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, math.sqrt(1 - sin_theta2 ** 2))

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This corrected approach ensures that the joint angles are calculated accurately using the law of cosines and sines, providing the correct positions for the TCP.
