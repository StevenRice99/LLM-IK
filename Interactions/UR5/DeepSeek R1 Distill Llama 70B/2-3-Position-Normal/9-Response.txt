To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Extract the target position**: The target position `p` is given as a tuple `(x, y, z)`. Since the robot can only move in the X-Z plane, we focus on `x` and `z`.

2. **Define the link lengths**: The first link (L1) is 0.39225 meters, and the second link (L2) is 0.093 meters.

3. **Calculate the distance from the base to the target**: Using the Pythagorean theorem, compute the distance from the base of the robot to the target position.

4. **Apply the law of cosines to find q2**: Formulate the equation using the law of cosines to relate the joint angles to the target position.

5. **Solve for q2**: Use the derived equation to solve for q2 using the `atan2` function.

6. **Solve for q1**: Once q2 is known, solve for q1 using the remaining equations derived from the law of cosines.

7. **Handle multiple solutions**: Since trigonometric equations can have multiple solutions, ensure that the solution corresponds to the robot's joint limits.

8. **Implement the solution in code**: Translate the derived equations into a Python function that computes q1 and q2 given the target position.

Here is the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.093    # Length of the second link

    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target
    distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    # Apply the law of cosines to find q2
    cos_q2 = (A**2 + B**2 - distance**2) / (2 * A * B)
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    sin_q2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_q2**2)  # Assuming positive sin_q2

    # Solve for q2 using atan2
    q2 = math.atan2(sin_q2, cos_q2)

    # Solve for q1 using the law of cosines
    cos_q1 = (A**2 + distance**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * distance)
    cos_q1 = max(min(cos_q1, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    sin_q1 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_q1**2)  # Assuming positive sin_q1

    q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)

    return (q1, q2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles `q1` and `q2` to move the TCP to the desired position `p`. It uses geometric relationships and trigonometric identities to solve the inverse kinematics problem efficiently.
