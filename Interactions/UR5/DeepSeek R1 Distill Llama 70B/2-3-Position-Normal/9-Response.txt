To address the inaccuraciesin the inverse kinematics solution, we need to refine the approach to ensure accurate joint angle calculations. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the corrected method:

1. **Extract the Target Position**: Focus on the X and Z components of the target position since the Y component is fixed.

2. **Define Constants**: Use the lengths of the links, A and B, as given.

3. **Calculate the Magnitude M**: Compute the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane.

4. **Handle Special Cases**: If M is zero, set both joint angles to zero.

5. **Compute the Angle phi**: Use `atan2` to find the angle of the target position relative to the X-axis.

6. **Calculate K Using the Law of Cosines**: Ensure K is within the valid range for `arccos`.

7. **Find theta1_minus_phi**: Use `arccos` to find the angle difference.

8. **Determine theta1**: Add the angle difference to phi.

9. **Calculate sin_theta2 Using the Law of Sines**: Clamp `sin_theta2` to the range [-1, 1] to avoid invalid values.

10. **Calculate cos_theta2**: Use the Pythagorean identity, ensuring the argument is non-negative.

11. **Determine theta2**: Use `atan2` to find the correct quadrant for theta2.

Here is the corrected Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    p_x, _, p_z = p  # p_y is fixed at 0.093 and can be ignored
    A = 0.39225
    B = 0.093

    # Calculate the magnitude of the target position in the X-Z plane
    M = math.sqrt(p_x ** 2 + p_z ** 2)
    if M == 0:
        # If the target is at the origin in X-Z, handle separately
        theta1 = 0.0
        theta2 = 0.0
        return (theta1, theta2)

    # Calculate the angle phi from the target position
    phi = math.atan2(p_z, p_x)

    # Calculate K using the law of cosines
    K = (A ** 2 + B ** 2 - M ** 2) / (2 * A * B)

    # Ensure K is within the valid range for arccos
    K = max(min(K, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1_minus_phi = math.acos(K)
    theta1 = phi + theta1_minus_phi

    # Calculate sin(theta2) using the law of sines
    sin_theta2 = (A * math.sin(theta1_minus_phi)) / B

    # Clamp sin_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid invalid values
    sin_theta2 = max(min(sin_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Calculate cos(theta2) and ensure it's non-negative
    cos_theta2 = math.sqrt(max(0, 1 - sin_theta2 ** 2))

    # Use atan2 to get theta2 in the correct quadrant
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clamping `sin_theta2`:** Ensures that the value does not exceed the valid range for the sine function, preventing invalid arguments in subsequent calculations.

2. **Handling `cos_theta2`:** Uses the Pythagorean identity to calculate the cosine, ensuring the argument inside the square root is non-negative to avoid math domain errors.

3. **Using `atan2` for `theta2`:** Ensures that the angle `theta2` is determined in the correct quadrant based on the signs of `sin_theta2` and `cos_theta2`.

These adjustments improve the accuracy of the joint angle calculations and handle numerical precision issues gracefully, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position accurately.
