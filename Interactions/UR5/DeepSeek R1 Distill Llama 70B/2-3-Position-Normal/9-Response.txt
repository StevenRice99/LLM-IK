To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, y, z). The solution involves solving the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The first joint is at the origin, and the second joint is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]. The TCP is located at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations**:
   - The position of the TCP in the world frame is given by:
     \[
     P_{tcp} = R_Y(\theta_1) \times [0, 0, 0.39225] + R_Y(\theta_2) \times [0, 0.093, 0]
     \]
     where \( R_Y(\theta) \) is the rotation matrix around the Y-axis for angle θ.

3. **Derive Equations**:
   - From the Y-component: \( 0.093 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = y \)
   - From the Z-component: \( 0.39225 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = z \)
   - From the X-component: \( 0.093 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = x \)

4. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 + \theta_2 \) using the X and Y components.
   - Use the Z component to verify the solution.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Offset of the TCP from the second joint

    # Calculate the angle alpha which is the sum of theta1 and theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, y)

    # Solve for theta2 using the y-component equation
    sin_theta2 = y / L2
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using the x-component equation
    cos_theta1 = x / L1
    theta1 = math.acos(cos_theta1)

    # Verify theta1 using the z-component equation
    z_calculated = L1 * math.cos(theta1) + L2 * math.sin(theta2)
    if not math.isclose(z, z_calculated, rel_tol=1e-9):
        # If not, try the supplementary angle for theta1
        theta1 = -theta1
        z_calculated = L1 * math.cos(theta1) + L2 * math.sin(theta2)
        if not math.isclose(z, z_calculated, rel_tol=1e-9):
            # If still not matching, raise an error (should not happen as per problem statement)
            pass

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate Alpha**: The angle alpha is determined using the arctangent of x over y, which gives the direction to the target position.
2. **Solve for Theta2**: Using the Y-component equation, we find theta2 by taking the arcsin of (y / 0.093).
3. **Solve for Theta1**: Using the X-component equation, we find theta1 by taking the arccos of (x / 0.39225).
4. **Verify Theta1**: Using the Z-component equation, we verify the correctness of theta1 by checking if the calculated z matches the desired z. If not, we adjust theta1 by considering the supplementary angle.

This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position by solving the joint angles accurately.
