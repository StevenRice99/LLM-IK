To address the issues in theinverse kinematics function, we need to develop a more accurate analytical model of the robot's kinematics. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. **Model the Robot Kinematics**: Represent the robot's links and joints using homogeneous transformation matrices or Denavit-Hartenberg parameters to capture the spatial relationships accurately.

2. **Express TCP Position**: Derive the forward kinematics equations to express the TCP position in terms of the joint angles \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \).

3. **Set Up Equations**: Set the derived TCP position equal to the target position \( p \) and solve for \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \).

4. **Solve for Joint Angles**: Use algebraic manipulation or geometric insights to solve the system of equations for the joint angles.

5. **Implement the Solution**: Update the inverse kinematics function with the new analytical solution to compute the correct joint angles.

By following these steps, we ensure that the joint angles calculated will accurately position the TCP at the desired target position.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane
    D_squared = x**2 + z**2
    D = math.sqrt(D_squared)

    # Compute cos(q2) using the law of cosines
    numerator = D_squared - L1**2 - L2**2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * L2
    cos_q2 = numerator / denominator
    # Ensure cos_q2 is within valid range to avoid math domain errors
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)
    q2 = math.acos(cos_q2)

    # Calculate theta as the angle from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Compute q1
    q1 = theta - q2

    return (q1, q2)
