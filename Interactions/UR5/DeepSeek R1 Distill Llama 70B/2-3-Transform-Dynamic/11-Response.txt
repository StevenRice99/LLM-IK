To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired target position and orientation. Here's a step-by-step solution:

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP is offset by 0.093 units in the Y-axis from the second joint.
2. **Position and Orientation Equations**: Using the rotation matrices, derive the TCP's position and orientation in the base frame:
   - \( x = 0.39225 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + 0.18805 \cdot \sin(\theta_2) \)
   - \( z = 0.39225 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) + 0.18805 \cdot \cos(\theta_2) \)
   - The orientation around the Y-axis is \( \theta_1 + \theta_2 \).
3. **Express θ2 in Terms of θ1**: Using the orientation equation, \( \theta_2 = \text{ry} - \theta_1 \).
4. **Substitute θ2 into Position Equations**: Substitute \( \theta_2 \) into the position equations and solve for \( \theta_1 \) using trigonometric identities and matrix inversion.
5. **Calculate θ1 and θ2**: Use the derived equations to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Define the lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.18805
    
    # Calculate coefficients
    A = L1 - L2 * math.cos(ry)
    B = L2 * math.sin(ry)
    C = L1 + L2 * math.cos(ry)
    D = L2 * math.sin(ry)
    
    # Calculate determinant
    det = A * C - B * D
    
    # Solve for sinθ1 and cosθ1
    sin_theta1 = (C * px - B * pz) / det
    cos_theta1 = (-D * px + A * pz) / det
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Ensure theta1 is within the valid range
    if theta1 < -math.pi:
        theta1 += 2 * math.pi
    elif theta1 > math.pi:
        theta1 -= 2 * math.pi
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Position and Orientation Equations**: The equations are derived using rotation matrices to express the TCP's position and orientation in terms of the joint angles.
- **Matrix Inversion**: The system of equations is solved using matrix inversion to find \( \sin(\theta_1) \) and \( \cos(\theta_1) \).
- **Quadrant Adjustment**: The arctangent function is adjusted to ensure \( \theta_1 \) is within the valid range.
- **Joint Angle Calculation**: \( \theta_2 \) is derived from \( \theta_1 \) and the desired orientation.

This approach provides a comprehensive solution to position and orient the TCP accurately, leveraging both position and orientation information.
