To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired target position (px, pz). The orientation is not explicitly required beyond the position, so we focus on achieving the target position.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Robot Geometry**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The first joint is at the base, and the second joint is attached to the first. The TCP is located at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to the second link.

2. **Position Equations**: Using the rotation matrices for revolute joints, the position of the TCP in the base frame is given by:
   - x = 0.39225 * sin(θ1 + θ2)
   - z = 0.39225 * cos(θ1 + θ2)

3. **Solving for Joint Angles**: Given the target position (px, pz), we compute the total rotation angle φ = θ1 + θ2 using φ = atan2(px, pz). To simplify, we set θ2 to 0 and solve for θ1 as φ.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    # Since the y position is fixed at 0.093, we can ignore it for position calculation
    # Calculate the total rotation angle from the position
    phi = math.atan2(px, pz)
    # Set joint2 to 0 and joint1 to phi
    theta1 = phi
    theta2 = 0.0
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Position Calculation**: The TCP's position is determined by the combined rotation of both joints. By setting θ2 to 0, we simplify the problem, allowing θ1 to be the primary contributor to reaching the target position.
- **Orientation**: Since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the orientation around Y is controlled by the sum of the joint angles. However, without additional constraints, we assume the orientation is either fixed or not required beyond the position.

This approach provides a straightforward solution to position the TCP at the desired location, leveraging the geometric constraints of the robot arm.
