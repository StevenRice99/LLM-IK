To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired target position (px, pz) and orientation (rx, ry, rz). The orientation is crucial for accurately reaching the target, so we must incorporate it into our solution.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Robot Geometry**: The robot has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The first joint is at the base, and the second joint is attached to the first. The TCP is located at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to the second link.

2. **Position Equations**: Using the rotation matrices for revolute joints, the position of the TCP in the base frame is given by:
   - x = 0.39225 * sin(θ1 + θ2)
   - z = 0.39225 * cos(θ1 + θ2)

3. **Orientation Consideration**: The orientation is given as Euler angles (rx, ry, rz). Since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the total rotation around Y is θ1 + θ2. We can set ry = θ1 + θ2 to align the orientation with the joint rotations.

4. **Solving for Joint Angles**: Using the position and orientation equations, we can solve for θ1 and θ2:
   - θ1 + θ2 = ry
   - 0.39225 * sin(ry) = px
   - 0.39225 * cos(ry) = pz

5. **Implementation**: Using the above equations, we can compute θ1 and θ2 to achieve both the desired position and orientation.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate the total rotation angle from the orientation
    total_rotation = ry  # Assuming ry is the rotation around Y-axis
    
    # Calculate the total rotation angle from the position
    phi = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Set joint1 and joint2 to achieve both position and orientation
    theta1 = phi
    theta2 = total_rotation - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Position Calculation**: The TCP's position is determined by the combined rotation of both joints. By setting θ1 based on the position and adjusting θ2 to match the orientation, we ensure both the position and orientation are achieved.
- **Orientation Alignment**: By aligning the total rotation of the joints with the desired orientation around the Y-axis, we ensure the TCP reaches the correct orientation.

This approach provides a comprehensive solution to position and orient the TCP accurately, leveraging both position and orientation information.
