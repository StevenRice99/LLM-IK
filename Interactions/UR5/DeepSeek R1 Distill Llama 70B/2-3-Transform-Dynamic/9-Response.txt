To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired target position and orientation. Here's a step-by-step solution:

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP is offset by 0.093 units in the Y-axis from the second joint.
2. **Position Equations**: Using the rotation matrices, derive the TCP's position in the base frame:
   - \( x = 0.39225 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + 0.093 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \)
   - \( z = 0.39225 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) + 0.093 \cdot \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \)
3. **Orientation Equation**: The orientation around the Y-axis is given by \( \theta_1 + \theta_2 = \text{ry} \).
4. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - Express \( \theta_2 \) in terms of \( \theta_1 \): \( \theta_2 = \text{ry} - \theta_1 \).
   - Substitute \( \theta_2 \) into the position equations and solve for \( \theta_1 \) using trigonometric identities.
   - Use the arctangent function to find \( \theta_1 \) and adjust for the correct quadrant.
   - Calculate \( \theta_2 \) using \( \theta_2 = \text{ry} - \theta_1 \).

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Define the lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate the adjusted position based on orientation
    px_adj = px - L2 * math.sin(ry)
    pz_adj = pz - L2 * math.cos(ry)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent, considering the correct quadrant
    theta1 = math.atan2(px_adj, pz_adj)
    
    # Ensure theta1 is in the correct quadrant
    if px_adj < 0 and pz_adj > 0:
        theta1 += math.pi
    elif px_adj < 0 and pz_adj < 0:
        theta1 -= math.pi
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Position Adjustment**: The TCP's position is adjusted by subtracting the contribution of the second link's orientation, allowing us to solve for the first joint angle.
- **Quadrant Adjustment**: The arctangent function is adjusted to ensure the angle is in the correct quadrant based on the signs of the adjusted position coordinates.
- **Joint Angle Calculation**: The second joint angle is derived from the orientation requirement, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired orientation.

This approach provides a comprehensive solution to position and orient the TCP accurately, leveraging both position and orientation information.
