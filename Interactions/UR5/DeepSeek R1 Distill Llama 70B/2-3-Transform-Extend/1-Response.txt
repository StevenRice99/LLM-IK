To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles that will move the TCP to the desired position and orientation. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Extract Joint 1 Angle (q1):**
   - Using the desired position (x, z), compute q1 using the arctangent of x over z. This gives the angle for the first joint.

2. **Compute Desired Rotation Matrix (R):**
   - Convert the desired Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) into a rotation matrix using the standard Euler angle convention (Rz * Ry * Rx).

3. **Determine Equivalent Y Rotation Angle (theta_y):**
   - Extract the equivalent rotation angle around the Y-axis from the rotation matrix R. This is done using the arctangent of the (0,2) element over the (0,0) element of R.

4. **Calculate Joint 2 Angle (q2):**
   - Subtract q1 from theta_y to find q2, ensuring the TCP's orientation matches the desired Euler angles.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Calculate the first joint angle q1 from the position
    q1 = np.arctan2(x, z)

    # Create the rotation matrices for each Euler angle
    # Rotation around x (roll)
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, np.cos(rx), -np.sin(rx)],
        [0, np.sin(rx), np.cos(rx)]
    ])
    # Rotation around y (pitch)
    Ry = np.array([
        [np.cos(ry), 0, np.sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-np.sin(ry), 0, np.cos(ry)]
    ])
    # Rotation around z (yaw)
    Rz = np.array([
        [np.cos(rz), -np.sin(rz), 0],
        [np.sin(rz), np.cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])

    # Compute the combined rotation matrix R = Rz * Ry * Rx
    R = np.dot(Rz, np.dot(Ry, Rx))

    # Calculate the equivalent rotation angle around Y (theta_y)
    theta_y = np.arctan2(R[0, 2], R[0, 0])

    # Calculate the second joint angle q2
    q2 = theta_y - q1

    return (q1, q2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation, considering both the geometric constraints and the rotational requirements of the robot arm.
