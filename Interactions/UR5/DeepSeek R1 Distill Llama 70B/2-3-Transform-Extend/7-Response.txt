To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. The approach involves calculating the joint angles based on the desired position and orientation, considering the robot's link lengths and joint axes.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - Calculate the first joint angle `q1` using the arctangent of the x and z coordinates of the desired position, adjusted for the second link's contribution.
   
2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - Determine the second joint angle `q2` by subtracting `q1` from the desired yaw angle `rz`, adjusted for the correct direction of rotation.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Define the lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link (offset to TCP)

    # Adjust the yaw angle to account for the direction of rotation
    rz = -rz

    # Calculate cos(q1) and sin(q1)
    cos_q1 = (x - L2 * math.cos(rz)) / L1
    sin_q1 = (z - L2 * math.sin(rz)) / L1

    # Calculate q1 using atan2
    q1 = math.atan2(sin_q1, cos_q1)

    # Calculate q2
    q2 = rz - q1

    return (q1, q2)
```

### Explanation
- **Position Calculation**: The x and z coordinates of the desired position are used to compute the first joint angle `q1` using `math.atan2`, which gives the angle whose tangent is the ratio of the adjusted z to the adjusted x.
- **Orientation Calculation**: The desired yaw angle `rz` from the orientation tuple is adjusted for direction and used to compute the second joint angle `q2` by subtracting `q1` from `rz`, ensuring the TCP achieves the correct orientation.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, leveraging basic trigonometric functions and the properties of revolute joints.
