To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we can use geometric analysis based on the robot's structure. The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis, and the goal is to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired location with the specified orientation.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The first joint (θ1) is at the origin, and the second joint (θ2) is positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225]. The TCP is located at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to the second joint.
2. **Forward Kinematics Equations**: Express the TCP's position in terms of θ1 and θ2. The position of the TCP relative to the base is given by:
   - x = L1 * cos(θ1) + L2 * cos(θ1 + θ2)
   - z = L1 * sin(θ1) + L2 * sin(θ1 + θ2)
3. **Orientation Consideration**: The orientation around the Y-axis (ry) is the sum of θ1 and θ2, i.e., ry = θ1 + θ2.
4. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - Adjust the desired position by subtracting the contribution from the second link.
   - Use trigonometric functions to solve for θ1.
   - Calculate θ2 using the orientation constraint.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link

    # Calculate adjusted x and z by removing the contribution from the second link
    x_adj = x - L2 * math.cos(ry)
    z_adj = z - L2 * math.sin(ry)

    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent of adjusted z and x
    theta1 = math.atan2(z_adj, x_adj)

    # Calculate theta2 based on the desired orientation around Y
    theta2 = ry - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Desired Position**: Subtract the contribution of the second link from the desired position to isolate the contribution from the first link.
2. **Calculate θ1**: Use the arctangent function to find θ1 based on the adjusted x and z coordinates.
3. **Determine θ2**: Use the orientation constraint to find θ2 as the difference between the desired orientation and θ1.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem using basic trigonometric relationships, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired pose.
