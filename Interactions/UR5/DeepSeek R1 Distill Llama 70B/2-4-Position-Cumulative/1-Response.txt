To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. First, we solve for the first two joints using the target's x and z coordinates, treating them as a 2-link arm in the x-z plane. Then, we use the target's y coordinate to solve for the third joint.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Solve for Theta1 and Theta2:**
   - Treat the first two joints as a 2-link arm in the x-z plane.
   - Use the law of cosines to find Theta2.
   - Use atan2 to find Theta1 based on the target's x and z coordinates.

2. **Solve for Theta3:**
   - Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the x-z plane (a).
   - Use the target's x, y, and a to compute cos(theta3) and sin(theta3).
   - Use atan2 to find Theta3.

Here's the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_t, y_t, z_t = p

    # Link lengths
    A = 0.39225  # Length of first link
    B = 0.093    # Length of second link
    C = 0.09465  # Length of TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 and theta2 using x_t and z_t
    # Calculate the target distance in the x-z plane
    target_distance = math.sqrt(x_t**2 + z_t**2)

    # Apply the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (A**2 + B**2 - target_distance**2) / (2 * A * B)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Use atan2 to find theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z_t, x_t)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta3 using x_t, y_t, and the known target_distance
    a = target_distance
    b = C

    # Calculate cos(theta3) and sin(theta3)
    cos_theta3 = (x_t * a + b * y_t) / (a**2 + b**2)
    sin_theta3 = (a * y_t - b * x_t) / (a**2 + b**2)

    # Find theta3 using atan2
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function first solves for the first two joints using the x and z components of the target position. It then uses the y component to adjust the third joint, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position in 3D space.
