To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a structured approach to determine the joint angles needed to reach a specified target position. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot's Geometry:**
   - **Link 1:** Length \( A = 0.39225 \) meters, rotating about the Y-axis.
   - **Link 2:** Length \( B = 0.093 \) meters, rotating about the Y-axis.
   - **Link 3:** Length \( C = 0.09465 \) meters, rotating about the Z-axis.
   - **TCP:** Located at the end of Link 3.

2. **Projection onto the X-Z Plane:**
   - Project the target position onto the X-Z plane to solve for the first two joints.
   - Use the law of cosines to find the angle for the second joint.
   - Use the arctangent function to find the angle for the first joint based on the target's X and Z coordinates.

3. **Adjust for the Y Position:**
   - Use the Y coordinate to adjust the third joint angle to ensure the TCP reaches the correct position in 3D space.

4. **Numerical Stability:**
   - Clamp values passed to trigonometric functions to prevent domain errors.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_t, y_t, z_t = p

    # Link lengths
    A = 0.39225  # Length of first link
    B = 0.093    # Length of second link
    C = 0.09465  # Length of TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 and theta2 using x_t and z_t
    # Calculate the target distance in the x-z plane
    target_distance = math.sqrt(x_t**2 + z_t**2)

    # Apply the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (A**2 + B**2 - target_distance**2) / (2 * A * B)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to prevent domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Use atan2 to find theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z_t, x_t)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta3 using y_t
    # Calculate the required adjustment for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_t, target_distance)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Projection onto the X-Z Plane:**
   - The target position is projected onto the X-Z plane to simplify the calculation of the first two joint angles.
   - The law of cosines is used to find the angle for the second joint, ensuring the calculation is within valid bounds.

2. **Adjustment for Y Position:**
   - The third joint angle is calculated using the arctangent of the Y position relative to the projected distance in the X-Z plane, ensuring the TCP reaches the correct height.

3. **Numerical Stability:**
   - The `cos_theta2` value is clamped between -1 and 1 to prevent domain errors when using the `math.acos()` function.

This approach efficiently calculates the joint angles needed to reach the target position, ensuring accuracy and numerical stability.
