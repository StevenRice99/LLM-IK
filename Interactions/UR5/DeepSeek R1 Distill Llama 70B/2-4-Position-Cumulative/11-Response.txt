To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll calculate the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 step by step. Here's the approach:

1. **Calculate θ1 (Joint 1):** Use the arctangent of the target's x and z coordinates to determine the base rotation around the Y-axis.
2. **Adjust the target position:** Subtract the contribution of Joint 1 to get the adjusted x and z coordinates relative to Joint 2.
3. **Calculate θ2 (Joint 2):** Use the adjusted x and z to find the rotation around the Y-axis for Joint 2.
4. **Adjust for Joint 2's contribution:** Subtract the effect of Joint 2 to isolate the remaining target position for Joint 3.
5. **Calculate θ3 (Joint 3):** Use the remaining y-coordinate to determine the rotation around the Z-axis for Joint 3.

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent of x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust x and z by subtracting the contribution from joint1
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the adjusted x and z
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Adjust for joint2's contribution
    final_y = y - 0.093  # Subtract the offset from joint3's position
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the remaining y coordinate
    theta3 = math.atan2(final_y, adjusted_x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function computes the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering each joint's contribution step by step.
