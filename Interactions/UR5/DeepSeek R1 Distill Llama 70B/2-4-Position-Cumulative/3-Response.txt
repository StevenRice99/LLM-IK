To resolve the `ValueError: math domain error` in the inverse kinematics function, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.acos()` is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by clamping the value of `cos_theta2` before using it in the `acos` function.

Here's the modified code with the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_t, y_t, z_t = p

    # Link lengths
    A = 0.39225  # Length of first link
    B = 0.093    # Length of second link
    C = 0.09465  # Length of TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 and theta2 using x_t and z_t
    # Calculate the target distance in the x-z plane
    target_distance = math.sqrt(x_t**2 + z_t**2)

    # Apply the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (A**2 + B**2 - target_distance**2) / (2 * A * B)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to prevent domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Use atan2 to find theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z_t, x_t)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta3 using x_t, y_t, and the known target_distance
    a = target_distance
    b = C

    # Calculate cos(theta3) and sin(theta3)
    cos_theta3 = (x_t * a + b * y_t) / (a**2 + b**2)
    sin_theta3 = (a * y_t - b * x_t) / (a**2 + b**2)

    # Find theta3 using atan2
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`:**
   - Added a line to clamp `cos_theta2` between -1 and 1 using `max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)`. This ensures that the argument passed to `math.acos()` is always within the valid domain, preventing the `ValueError`.

2. **Maintaining the Rest of the Logic:**
   - The rest of the calculations for `theta1` and `theta3` remain unchanged as they were correctly implemented.

This modification addresses the domain error by ensuring numerical stability in the calculation of `theta2`, making the function robust against minor numerical inaccuracies that could push `cos_theta2` slightly out of the valid range.
