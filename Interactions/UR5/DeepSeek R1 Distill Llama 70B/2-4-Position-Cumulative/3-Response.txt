To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we'll break it down into steps, solving for each joint angle sequentially.

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**  
   - This joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can find the angle θ1 using the x and z coordinates of the target position.  
   - Using `math.atan2(x, z)`, we determine θ1.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**  
   - This joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We calculate θ2 using the y-coordinate.  
   - Using trigonometric relationships, we find θ2 based on the target's y position.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**  
   - This joint rotates around the Z-axis. We calculate θ3 using the remaining components after accounting for the first two joints.  
   - Using `math.atan2` again with adjusted coordinates, we find θ3.

Here's the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint 2
    theta2 = math.acos(y / 0.093)  # 0.093 is the length from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Solve for joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(0.09465, 0.093)  # Using known link lengths
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This approach sequentially solves for each joint, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.
