To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach to determine the joint angles that position the tool center point (TCP) at the desired target position. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Robot Geometry

The robot consists of three revolute joints and a TCP. The links have the following properties:

- **Joint 1:** Rotates around the Y-axis, with a position of [0, 0, 0].
- **Joint 2:** Rotates around the Y-axis, positioned at [0, 0, 0.39225].
- **Joint 3:** Rotates around the Z-axis, positioned at [0, 0.093, 0].
- **TCP:** Positioned at [0, 0.093, 0.09465].

### Step 2: Define the Forward Kinematics

Using homogeneous transformation matrices (HTMs), we can express the position and orientation of each link relative to the base frame.

1. **Joint 1 (θ1):**
   - Rotation around Y-axis: 
     \[
     T_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta_1 & 0 & \sin\theta_1 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
     -\sin\theta_1 & 0 & \cos\theta_1 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Translation along Z-axis by 0.39225:
     \[
     T_{1}^{trans} = \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 1 & 0.39225 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

2. **Joint 2 (θ2):**
   - Rotation around Y-axis:
     \[
     T_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta_2 & 0 & \sin\theta_2 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
     -\sin\theta_2 & 0 & \cos\theta_2 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - Translation along Y-axis by 0.093:
     \[
     T_{2}^{trans} = \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 1 & 0 & 0.093 \\
     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

3. **Joint 3 (θ3):**
   - Rotation around Z-axis:
     \[
     T_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos\theta_3 & -\sin\theta_3 & 0 & 0 \\
     \sin\theta_3 & \cos\theta_3 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 1 & 0.09465 \\
     0 & 0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

The overall transformation from the base to the TCP is:
\[
T_{TCP} = T_1 \cdot T_{1}^{trans} \cdot T_2 \cdot T_{2}^{trans} \cdot T_3
\]

### Step 3: Set Up the Inverse Kinematics Problem

Given a target position \( p = [x, y, z] \), we need to find the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) such that the TCP reaches \( p \).

1. **Express the TCP Position:**
   Using the HTMs, the TCP position is derived from the product of the transformation matrices. This results in equations relating \( x, y, z \) to \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \).

2. **Solve for Joint Angles:**
   - **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)):** Solve using the x and z components.
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
     \]
   - **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)):** Solve using the y component and the known link lengths.
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{y - 0.093}{0.09465}\right)
     \]
   - **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \)):** Solve using the remaining components after accounting for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
     \[
     \theta_3 = \arctan2\left(x', y'\right)
     \]
     where \( x' \) and \( y' \) are the adjusted coordinates after applying \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Step 4: Implement the Solution in Python

Here's the Python function implementing the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 using x and z components
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust y component for joint 2 calculation
    adjusted_y = y - 0.093  # Account for the offset from joint 2 to TCP
    link_length = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Solve for joint 2 using the adjusted y component
    theta2 = math.acos(adjusted_y / link_length)
    
    # Adjust x and y for joint 3 calculation
    adjusted_x = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_y = y * math.cos(theta1) - z * math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Solve for joint 3 using the adjusted x and y components
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, adjusted_x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Step 5: Verify the Solution

To ensure the solution is correct, test the function with known target positions and verify that the calculated joint angles result in the TCP reaching the desired position. This can be done by plugging the joint angles back into the forward kinematics equations and checking if the resulting TCP position matches the target.

### Conclusion

By systematically breaking down the problem and using geometric transformations, we've derived a closed-form solution for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF serial manipulator. This approach ensures that each joint's contribution is accurately accounted for, leading to precise control of the TCP's position.
