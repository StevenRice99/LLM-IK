To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that position the tool center point (TCP) at a given target position. Given the robot's geometry and constraints, we can derive a closed-form solution.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: The robot has three revolute joints with specific link lengths and offsets. The TCP is offset from the third joint by known distances in the Y and Z directions.
2. **Forward Kinematics**: Using homogeneous transformation matrices, we express the TCP's position in terms of the joint angles.
3. **Inverse Kinematics**: Given a target position, we solve for the joint angles that achieve this position. Since the Y position is fixed, we only need to solve for the angles affecting the X and Z positions.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Check if the target y position is reachable (should be 0.093)
    if not (y == 0.093):
        raise ValueError("Target y position is not reachable. It must be 0.093.")
    
    # Calculate theta1 using x and z components
    link_length = 0.09465  # Distance from Joint 3 to TCP in the X-Z plane
    z_offset = 0.39225    # Distance from Joint 1 to Joint 2 along Z
    
    # Adjust z by the offset
    adjusted_z = z - z_offset
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent of adjusted x and z
    theta1 = math.atan2(x * link_length, adjusted_z * link_length)
    
    # Set theta2 and theta3 to zero since they don't affect the position
    theta2 = 0.0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Check Reachability**: The function first checks if the target Y position is 0.093, as this is the only reachable Y position for the TCP.
2. **Adjust Z Position**: The Z position is adjusted by subtracting the offset from Joint 1 to Joint 2.
3. **Calculate Theta1**: Using the arctangent function, Theta1 is determined from the adjusted X and Z positions, scaled by the link length.
4. **Set Theta2 and Theta3**: Since Theta2 and Theta3 do not affect the TCP's position in this configuration, they are set to zero.

This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the desired X and Z positions while maintaining the fixed Y position, providing an accurate solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
