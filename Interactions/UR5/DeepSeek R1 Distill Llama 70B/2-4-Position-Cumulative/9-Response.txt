To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator accurately, we need to consider all three joint angles and their contributions to the TCP's position in 3D space. Here's a structured approach:

1. **Understand the Robot's Geometry:**
   - **Link 1:** Length \( A = 0.39225 \) meters, rotating about the Y-axis.
   - **Link 2:** Length \( B = 0.093 \) meters, rotating about the Y-axis.
   - **Link 3:** Length \( C = 0.09465 \) meters, rotating about the Z-axis.
   - **TCP:** Located at the end of Link 3.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   - The position of the TCP in the global coordinate system can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = A \cos(\theta_1) + B \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + C \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3)
     \]
     \[
     y = A \sin(\theta_1) + B \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + C \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3)
     \]
     \[
     z = 0 + 0 + 0
     \]
   - Note: Since all joints are revolute and the problem is planar, \( z \) remains constant.

3. **Inverse Kinematics Approach:**
   - **Step 1:** Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the x and y coordinates.
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
     \]
   - **Step 2:** Solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the remaining distance in the x-y plane.
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{x^2 + y^2 - A^2 - B^2}{2AB}\right)
     \]
   - **Step 3:** Solve for \( \theta_3 \) to adjust the TCP's position in the z-direction.
     \[
     \theta_3 = \arctan\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right)
     \]

4. **Implementation:**
   - Use the above equations to compute each joint angle iteratively.
   - Ensure to handle edge cases and singularities, such as when the target is out of reach or when intermediate calculations result in invalid values.

5. **Code Implementation:**
   - Implement the equations in a function that takes the target position as input and returns the joint angles.

By systematically addressing each joint's contribution and incorporating all three dimensions, the inverse kinematics solution becomes more accurate and robust.
