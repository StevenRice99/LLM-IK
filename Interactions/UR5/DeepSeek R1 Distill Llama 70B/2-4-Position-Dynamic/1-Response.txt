To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll extend the existing solution for two joints to include the third joint. The approach involves setting up the forward kinematics equations and solving them symbolically using SymPy.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Define the Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   Express the TCP's position (x, y, z) in terms of the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

2. **Set Up the System of Equations:**
   Equate the desired position (px, py, pz) to the forward kinematics equations.

3. **Solve the System Symbolically:**
   Use SymPy to solve the system of nonlinear equations for θ1, θ2, and θ3.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   Translate the symbolic solution into numerical code within the inverse_kinematics function.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sin, cos

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    θ1, θ2, θ3 = symbols('θ1 θ2 θ3')
    
    # Forward kinematics equations
    eq1 = Eq(x, 0.093 * sin(θ2) * cos(θ3) + 0.09465 * sin(θ3) * cos(θ1))
    eq2 = Eq(y, 0.093 * cos(θ2) * cos(θ3) + 0.09465 * sin(θ3) * sin(θ1))
    eq3 = Eq(z, 0 + 0.093 * sin(θ2) * sin(θ3) + 0.09465 * cos(θ3))
    
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (θ1, θ2, θ3))
    
    # Extract the solution (assuming a single real solution exists as per problem statement)
    θ1_val = float(solution[0][0])
    θ2_val = float(solution[0][1])
    θ3_val = float(solution[0][2])
    
    return (θ1_val, θ2_val, θ3_val)
```

This solution uses SymPy to symbolically solve the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics. The function returns the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location.
