To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-joint serial manipulator, we derive the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 based on the desired TCP position. Here's a step-by-step explanation and solution:

### Step-by-Step Explanation and Solution

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**:
   - The robot has three revolute joints: two rotating about the Y-axis (θ1 and θ2) and one about the Z-axis (θ3).
   - The TCP's position is determined by the cumulative transformations of these joints.

2. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - Each joint's transformation includes a rotation followed by a translation.
   - The total transformation from the base to the TCP is the product of these individual transformations.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Given the desired TCP position (x, y, z), we need to solve for the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

4. **Simplifying Assumptions**:
   - To simplify the problem, assume θ1 = 0. This reduces the problem to solving for θ2 and θ3.

5. **Derive Equations**:
   - From the z-coordinate:
     \[
     z = 0.39225 \cdot \cos\theta_2 + 0.09465
     \]
     Solve for \(\cos\theta_2\) and \(\sin\theta_2\):
     \[
     \cos\theta_2 = \frac{z - 0.09465}{0.39225}
     \]
     \[
     \sin\theta_2 = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\theta_2}
     \]

   - From the x and y coordinates:
     \[
     x = 0.39225 \cdot \sin\theta_2 \cdot \cos\theta_3 - 0.186 \cdot \sin\theta_3
     \]
     \[
     y = 0.39225 \cdot \sin\theta_2 \cdot \sin\theta_3 + 0.186 \cdot \cos\theta_3
     \]

6. **Solve for θ3**:
   - Express the equations in terms of \(\cos\theta_3\) and \(\sin\theta_3\):
     \[
     x = A \cdot \cos\theta_3 - B \cdot \sin\theta_3
     \]
     \[
     y = A \cdot \sin\theta_3 + B \cdot \cos\theta_3
     \]
     where \(A = 0.39225 \cdot \sin\theta_2\) and \(B = 0.186\).

   - Solve for \(\cos\theta_3\) and \(\sin\theta_3\):
     \[
     \cos\theta_3 = \frac{A \cdot x + B \cdot y}{A^2 + B^2}
     \]
     \[
     \sin\theta_3 = \frac{-B \cdot x + A \cdot y}{A^2 + B^2}
     \]

   - Compute \(\theta_3\) using:
     \[
     \theta_3 = \arctan2\left(\sin\theta_3, \cos\theta_3\right)
     \]

7. **Compute θ2**:
   - Using \(\cos\theta_2\) and \(\sin\theta_2\):
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arctan2\left(\sin\theta_2, \cos\theta_2\right)
     \]

8. **Set θ1**:
   - As per the simplifying assumption, set \(\theta_1 = 0\).

### Final Solution Code

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2
    cos_theta2 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.39225
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    
    # Calculate A and B
    A = 0.39225 * sin_theta2
    B = 0.186
    
    # Calculate cos_theta3 and sin_theta3
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    if denominator == 0:
        # Handle division by zero, though this should not occur for valid targets
        return (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
    cos_theta3 = (A * x + B * y) / denominator
    sin_theta3 = (-B * x + A * y) / denominator
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    # Set theta1 to 0 as per simplifying assumption
    theta1 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Extract the desired position coordinates (x, y, z).
- **Step 2**: Calculate \(\cos\theta_2\) and \(\sin\theta_2\) using the z-coordinate. Clamp \(\cos\theta_2\) to the range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors.
- **Step 3**: Compute intermediate values A and B based on \(\sin\theta_2\).
- **Step 4**: Solve for \(\cos\theta_3\) and \(\sin\theta_3\) using the x and y coordinates. Handle potential division by zero.
- **Step 5**: Determine \(\theta_3\) using the arctangent function.
- **Step 6**: Calculate \(\theta_2\) using the arctangent function.
- **Step 7**: Set \(\theta_1\) to 0 as per the simplifying assumption.

This approach provides a closed-form solution for the joint angles, allowing the TCP to reach the desired position. The code includes safeguards against numerical issues to ensure robustness.
