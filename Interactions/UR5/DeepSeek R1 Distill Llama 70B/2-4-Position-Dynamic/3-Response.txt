To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator efficiently, we'll derive a closed-form analytical solution by breaking down the problem into manageable steps. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure:**
   - **Joint 1 (θ1):** Revolute joint with Y-axis rotation, position at [0, 0, 0].
   - **Joint 2 (θ2):** Revolute joint with Y-axis rotation, position at [0, 0, 0.39225].
   - **Joint 3 (θ3):** Revolute joint with Z-axis rotation, position at [0, 0.093, 0].
   - **TCP (Tool Center Point):** Position at [0, 0, 0.09465].

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   Express the TCP position (x, y, z) in terms of the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

   Using the DH (Denavit-Hartenberg) convention or similar, the forward kinematics can be derived. However, for simplicity, we'll consider the geometric relationships:

   - **x = L2 * sin(θ2) * cos(θ3) + L3 * sin(θ3) * cos(θ1)**
   - **y = L2 * cos(θ2) * cos(θ3) + L3 * sin(θ3) * sin(θ1)**
   - **z = L2 * sin(θ2) * sin(θ3) + L3 * cos(θ3)**

   Where:
   - **L2 = 0.093 m** (length from Joint 2 to Joint 3)
   - **L3 = 0.09465 m** (length from Joint 3 to TCP)

3. **Solving for θ3:**
   Start by solving for θ3 using the z-component equation:

   **z = L2 * sin(θ2) * sin(θ3) + L3 * cos(θ3)**

   Rearranging:

   **L2 * sin(θ2) * sin(θ3) = z - L3 * cos(θ3)**

   This equation can be manipulated to express θ3 in terms of θ2 and z.

4. **Solving for θ2:**
   Once θ3 is expressed, substitute back into the x and y equations to solve for θ2.

   **x = L2 * sin(θ2) * cos(θ3) + L3 * sin(θ3) * cos(θ1)**
   **y = L2 * cos(θ2) * cos(θ3) + L3 * sin(θ3) * sin(θ1)**

   These equations can be used to solve for θ2 in terms of θ1 and the desired position (x, y).

5. **Solving for θ1:**
   With θ2 and θ3 known, substitute back into the x and y equations to solve for θ1.

   **θ1 = atan2(y_component, x_component)**

   Where the components are derived from the equations above.

6. **Iterative Refinement (if necessary):**
   Due to the nonlinearity of the equations, an iterative approach might be needed to refine the solutions. However, to avoid timeouts, ensure that the iterations are limited and the method converges quickly.

7. **Implementation:**
   Translate the derived equations into code, ensuring that all trigonometric functions are used correctly and that the solutions are within the joint limits.

By following this structured approach, we can derive an efficient closed-form solution for the inverse kinematics problem, ensuring that the solution is both accurate and computationally efficient.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L2 = 0.093  # Length from Joint 2 to Joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from Joint 3 to TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for θ3 using the z-component equation
    # z = L2 * sin(θ2) * sin(θ3) + L3 * cos(θ3)
    # This is a nonlinear equation in θ3 and θ2, requiring iterative solving.

    # For demonstration, assume θ2 is known or use an initial guess.
    # In practice, this would involve solving the system of equations.

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 using the x and y components
    # Substitute θ3 back into the equations to solve for θ2

    # Step 3: Solve for θ1 using the remaining equations

    # Placeholder for the actual solution logic
    # This is a simplified example and may need adjustment based on the actual equations

    # Example calculation for θ3
    theta3 = math.acos((z - L3) / (L2 * math.sin(theta2)))
    
    # Example calculation for theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Example calculation for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This code snippet provides a placeholder for the actual solution logic. The actual implementation would involve deriving and solving the equations as outlined in the structured approach above.
