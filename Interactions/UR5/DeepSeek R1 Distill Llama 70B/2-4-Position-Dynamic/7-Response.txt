To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll use an iterative approach with the Newton-Raphson method. This method allows us to approximate the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location efficiently.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Define the Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   Express the TCP's position (x, y, z) in terms of the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

2. **Set Up the System of Equations:**
   Equate the desired position (px, py, pz) to the forward kinematics equations.

3. **Apply the Newton-Raphson Method:**
   Use this iterative method to refine the joint angles until the TCP reaches the desired position.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   Translate the method into code, ensuring efficiency and convergence.

### Explanation:

1. **Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   These equations relate the joint angles to the TCP's position. They are derived based on the geometric configuration of the robot.

2. **Newton-Raphson Method:**
   This iterative method is used to find the roots of a system of nonlinear equations. In this case, it helps adjust the joint angles until the TCP reaches the desired position.

3. **Jacobian Matrix:**
   The Jacobian matrix relates the joint rates to the TCP's velocity. Its inverse is used to update the joint angles iteratively.

4. **Convergence Criteria:**
   The loop continues until the error between the current and desired positions is below a specified tolerance, ensuring the solution is sufficiently accurate.

5. **Joint Limits:**
   Although not explicitly checked in this code, the joint angles should be within the specified limits to ensure physical feasibility.

By implementing this approach, we efficiently solve the inverse kinematics problem, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position accurately and within a reasonable time frame.
