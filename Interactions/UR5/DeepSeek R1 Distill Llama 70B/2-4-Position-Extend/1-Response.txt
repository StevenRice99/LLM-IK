To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, y, z). The approach involves breaking down the problem into manageable steps, leveraging geometric transformations and trigonometric identities.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: The robot has three revolute joints. The first two joints rotate around the Y-axis, and the third joint rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is offset from the third joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics Insight**: By understanding how each joint's rotation affects the TCP's position, we can derive the necessary equations to solve for the joint angles in reverse.

3. **Simplify the Problem**: By setting θ2 to 0, we reduce the problem to finding θ1 and θ3, with θ1 being the difference between the first two joints (φ = θ1 - θ2).

4. **Calculate φ**: Using the z-coordinate, compute φ as the angle whose cosine is derived from the desired z-position adjusted by the TCP's offset.

5. **Determine θ3**: Using the x and y coordinates, solve for θ3 using trigonometric identities and the derived equations.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    B = 0.093    # Offset of link 3 in y-direction
    C = 0.09465  # Offset of TCP in z-direction

    # Calculate phi (theta1 - theta2), assuming theta2 = 0
    cos_phi = (z - C) / A
    # Ensure cos_phi is within valid range to avoid NaN
    cos_phi = max(min(cos_phi, 1.0), -1.0)
    phi = math.acos(cos_phi)

    # Calculate D = A * sin(phi)
    D = A * math.sqrt(1 - cos_phi ** 2)

    # Calculate theta3 using the derived equations
    denominator = D ** 2 + B ** 2
    if denominator == 0:
        theta3 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta3 = (x * D + y * B) / denominator
        sin_theta3 = (y * D - x * B) / denominator
        theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Set theta2 to 0, so theta1 = phi
    theta1 = phi
    theta2 = 0.0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate φ**: Using the z-coordinate, compute φ as the arccosine of the adjusted z-position. This gives the angle needed to position the TCP correctly along the z-axis.

2. **Compute θ3**: Using the x and y coordinates, solve for θ3 by forming a system of equations based on the robot's geometry. This involves calculating the cosine and sine components of θ3 and using the arctangent function to find the angle.

3. **Set θ2 to 0**: For simplicity, we assume θ2 is 0, which simplifies the problem and allows us to focus on θ1 and θ3.

This approach efficiently breaks down the problem, ensuring that each joint's contribution to the TCP's position is accurately calculated, leading to a precise solution for the inverse kinematics.
