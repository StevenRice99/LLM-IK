To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we extend the existing solution for the first two joints to include the third joint. The third joint's angle is set to zero since the problem specifies only the position of the TCP, and the orientation is not constrained.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Adjust the Target Position**: Subtract the TCP's offset (0.09465) from the desired z-coordinate to get the target position for the third joint.
2. **Solve for First Two Joints**: Use the existing function to solve for theta1 and theta2 using the adjusted target position.
3. **Set Third Joint Angle**: Set theta3 to zero as the orientation is not specified.

The code implementation is as follows:

```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Adjust z by the TCP offset
    adjusted_z = z - 0.09465
    # Use the existing solution for the first two joints
    theta1, theta2 = inverse_kinematics_subchain((x, y, adjusted_z))
    # Set theta3 to zero
    theta3 = 0.0
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

To implement this, we need to define the `inverse_kinematics_subchain` function as provided in the existing code.

```python
def inverse_kinematics_subchain(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" for the first two joints.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the first two joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.39225
    B = 0.093
    numerator = A ** 2 + x ** 2 + y ** 2 - B ** 2 - z ** 2
    denominator = 2 * A * x
    if denominator == 0:
        sin_theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        sin_theta1 = numerator / denominator
    cos_theta1 = z / A
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    cos_theta2 = y / B
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position by adjusting the first two joints and setting the third joint to zero, simplifying the solution without considering orientation.
