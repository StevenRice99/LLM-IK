To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (x, y, z). The approach involves breaking down the problem into manageable steps, leveraging geometric transformations and trigonometric identities.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: The robot has three revolute joints. The first two joints rotate around the Y-axis, and the third joint rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is offset from the third joint by 0.09465 meters in the Z-direction.

2. **Forward Kinematics Insight**: By understanding how each joint's rotation affects the TCP's position, we can derive the necessary equations to solve for the joint angles in reverse.

3. **Simplify the Problem**: To simplify, we can first solve for θ1 and θ2 as before, then adjust θ3 to fine-tune the TCP's position.

4. **Calculate θ1 and θ2**: Using the existing solution for the first two joints, we calculate θ1 and θ2 based on the desired position.

5. **Calculate θ3**: Using the remaining displacement after accounting for θ1 and θ2, solve for θ3 to position the TCP accurately.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    B = 0.093    # Offset of link 3 in y-direction
    C = 0.09465  # Offset of TCP in z-direction

    # Calculate theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution for the first two links
    # Assuming theta2 = 0, calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z - C)
    theta2 = 0.0

    # Now, calculate theta3 to adjust for the remaining position
    # Calculate the position after moving the first two links
    link2_x = A * math.cos(theta1)
    link2_z = A * math.sin(theta1) + C

    # The remaining position to reach the target from link2's position
    remaining_x = x - link2_x
    remaining_y = y - B
    remaining_z = z - link2_z

    # Calculate theta3 using the remaining position
    # Using the arctangent of the remaining y and x
    theta3 = math.atan2(remaining_y, remaining_x)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate θ1 and θ2**: Using the existing solution, θ1 is calculated based on the desired x and z coordinates, assuming θ2 is 0. This positions the first two links appropriately.

2. **Calculate θ3**: After determining the position of the second link, the remaining displacement to the target is calculated. Using the remaining x and y coordinates, θ3 is determined to adjust the third joint and accurately position the TCP.

This approach efficiently breaks down the problem, ensuring that each joint's contribution to the TCP's position is accurately calculated, leading to a precise solution for the inverse kinematics.
