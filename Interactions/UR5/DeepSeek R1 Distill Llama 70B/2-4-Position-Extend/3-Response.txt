To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 that position the TCP at a given target position p = (x, y, z). The approach involves extending the existing solution for the first two joints to include the third joint.

### Approach
1. **Existing Solution for θ1 and θ2**: Use the provided solution to calculate θ1 and θ2 by adjusting the target position based on the second link's length.
2. **Adjust Target Position for TCP Offset**: Subtract the TCP's offset in the Z-direction (0.09465 meters) from the target position to account for the third link's contribution.
3. **Calculate Position of Third Link's Origin**: Using θ1 and θ2, compute the position of the third link's origin.
4. **Solve for θ3**: Adjust the target position by subtracting the position of the third link's origin and solve for θ3 using the remaining X and Y components.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust the target position by subtracting the TCP offset in Z
    z_adj = z - 0.09465
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z_adj)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z_adj - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - theta1
    
    # Calculate the position of the third link's origin
    x2 = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    y2 = 0.093 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Adjust the target position by subtracting the third link's origin
    dx = x - x2
    dy = y - y2
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(dx, dy)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Target Position**: The target position is adjusted by subtracting the TCP's Z-offset to focus on the position reachable by the third link's origin.
2. **Solve for θ1 and θ2**: Using the existing solution, θ1 and θ2 are calculated based on the adjusted target position.
3. **Calculate Third Link's Origin**: With θ1 and θ2 known, the position of the third link's origin is determined.
4. **Solve for θ3**: The remaining X and Y errors are used to solve for θ3, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.

This approach extends the existing solution to include the third joint, allowing the manipulator to reach the desired TCP position accurately.
