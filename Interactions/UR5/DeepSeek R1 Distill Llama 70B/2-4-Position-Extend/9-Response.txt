To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that position the TCP at the desired target position. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**:
   - **Link 1**: Origin at [0, 0, 0], no offset, rotates around the Y-axis.
   - **Link 2**: Origin at [0, 0, 0.39225], rotates around the Y-axis.
   - **Link 3**: Origin at [0, 0.093, 0], rotates around the Z-axis.
   - **TCP**: Offset from Link 3 by [0, 0, 0.09465].

2. **Existing Solution for First Two Joints**:
   - Use the provided solution to calculate θ1 and θ2, assuming θ2 = 0.
   - θ1 is determined using `math.atan2(x, z - C)`, where C is the TCP offset.

3. **Calculate θ3**:
   - After determining θ1 and θ2, compute the position of Link 2.
   - Calculate the remaining displacement from Link 2's position to the target.
   - Use trigonometry to find θ3 based on the remaining x and y coordinates.

4. **Final Joint Angles**:
   - θ1 and θ2 are obtained from the existing solution.
   - θ3 is calculated to adjust the TCP to the exact target position.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    B = 0.093    # Offset of link 3 in y-direction
    C = 0.09465  # Offset of TCP in z-direction

    # Calculate theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution for the first two links
    # Assuming theta2 = 0, calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z - C)
    theta2 = 0.0

    # Now, calculate theta3 to adjust for the remaining position
    # Calculate the position after moving the first two links
    link2_x = A * math.cos(theta1)
    link2_z = A * math.sin(theta1) + C

    # The remaining position to reach the target from link2's position
    remaining_x = x - link2_x
    remaining_y = y - B
    remaining_z = z - link2_z

    # Calculate theta3 using the remaining position
    # Using the arctangent of the remaining y and x
    theta3 = math.atan2(remaining_y, remaining_x)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Calculate θ1 and θ2**:
   - θ1 is determined using the arctangent of the target's x and adjusted z coordinates.
   - θ2 is set to 0, simplifying the calculation for the first two joints.

2. **Calculate θ3**:
   - After moving the first two joints, compute the remaining displacement to the target.
   - Use the remaining x and y coordinates to find θ3, ensuring the TCP reaches the exact target position.

This approach efficiently breaks down the problem, ensuring each joint's contribution to the TCP's position is accurately calculated, leading to a precise solution for the inverse kinematics.
