To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll use the Jacobian pseudo-inverse method. This approach iteratively adjusts the joint angles to move the TCP towards the target position while respecting the robot's physical constraints.

### Approach
1. **Jacobian Matrix Calculation**: Compute the Jacobian matrix, which relates the joint velocities to the TCP velocities. This matrix is derived from the partial derivatives of the TCP position with respect to each joint angle.

2. **Error Calculation**: Determine the error vector between the target position and the current TCP position.

3. **Joint Angle Update**: Use the Jacobian pseudo-inverse to compute the necessary change in joint angles (Î”q) to reduce the error. This is done by multiplying the Jacobian pseudo-inverse with the error vector.

4. **Iteration and Convergence**: Repeat the process until the error is below a specified tolerance or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.

5. **Joint Limits Enforcement**: Ensure that the computed joint angles stay within the physical limits of the robot to avoid invalid configurations.

6. **Numerical Stability**: Use Tikhonov regularization to improve the conditioning of the Jacobian matrix, avoiding singularities and enhancing numerical stability.

### Explanation
1. **Jacobian Matrix**: The Jacobian matrix is computed by taking the partial derivatives of the TCP position with respect to each joint angle. This matrix is crucial as it maps joint velocities to TCP velocities.

2. **Error Calculation**: The error vector is the difference between the target position and the current TCP position. This drives the update in joint angles.

3. **Joint Angle Update**: Using the Jacobian pseudo-inverse, we compute the necessary change in joint angles to reduce the error. Tikhonov regularization is applied to handle singularities and improve numerical stability.

4. **Dynamic Learning Rate**: The learning rate is adjusted dynamically based on whether the error is decreasing or increasing. This helps in achieving faster convergence without oscillations.

5. **Joint Limits**: After each update, the joint angles are clamped within their physical limits to ensure valid configurations.

This approach ensures that the TCP moves accurately towards the target position while respecting the robot's constraints, providing a robust solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
