To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Define the DH Parameters**:
   - Joint 1: α = 0, a = 0, d = 0, θ = q1
   - Joint 2: α = π/2, a = 0.39225, d = 0, θ = q2
   - Joint 3: α = 0, a = 0.093, d = 0.09465, θ = q3

2. **Express the TCP Position**:
   - Using the DH transformation matrices, the TCP position (x, y, z) can be expressed in terms of q1, q2, and q3.

3. **Derive the Inverse Kinematics Equations**:
   - From the transformation matrices, derive equations relating x, y, z to q1, q2, and q3.
   - Solve these equations for q1, q2, and q3.

4. **Implement the Solution in Python**:
   - Write a function that takes the desired TCP position as input and returns the joint angles q1, q2, and q3.

Here is the Python function implementing the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 1
    theta1 = theta2
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 3
    theta3 = 0.0  # Since the TCP's z position is fixed
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering the fixed Z position and solving for the X and Y positions using the arctangent function.
