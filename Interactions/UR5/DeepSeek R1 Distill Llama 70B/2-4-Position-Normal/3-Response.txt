To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, we can derive the joint angles based on the desired position of the TCP. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Understand the Kinematic Structure:**
   - The robot has three revolute joints, each contributing to the position and orientation of the TCP.
   - The TCP's position is determined by the sum of the joint angles, considering the link lengths and offsets.

2. **Derive the Position Equations:**
   - The TCP's position in the X-Y plane is given by:
     - \( x = 0.093 \cdot \sin(q_2 - q_1) \)
     - \( y = 0.093 \cdot \cos(q_2 - q_1) \)
     - \( z = 0.4869 \) (fixed)
   - From these, we can solve for \( q_2 - q_1 \) using the arctangent function.

3. **Solve for Joint Angles:**
   - Let \( \theta = q_2 - q_1 = \arctan2(x, y) \).
   - To simplify, set \( q_1 = 0 \), then \( q_2 = \theta \).
   - \( q_3 \) can be set to 0 as it doesn't affect the TCP's position in this configuration.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Use the derived equations to compute the joint angles based on the desired TCP position.

Here is the Python function implementing the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # The z position is fixed at 0.4869 meters
    theta = math.atan2(x, y)
    return (0.0, theta, 0.0)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering the fixed Z position and solving for the X and Y positions using the arctangent function.
