To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we'll derive the joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4) that position the TCP at the target position (x, y, z). Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Define the Forward Kinematics

Using transformation matrices, express the TCP's position in terms of the joint angles.

1. **Joint 1 (q1)**: Rotate around the Y-axis.
2. **Joint 2 (q2)**: Rotate around the Y-axis.
3. **Joint 3 (q3)**: Rotate around the Z-axis.
4. **Joint 4 (q4)**: Rotate around the Y-axis.

The transformation matrices are multiplied to get the TCP's position.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equations

Equate the TCP's position from forward kinematics to the target position (x, y, z).

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles

Use SymPy to solve the system of nonlinear equations for q1, q2, q3, q4.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution

Translate the solution into a Python function that returns the joint angles.

### Final Answer

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    q1, q2, q3, q4 = symbols('q1 q2 q3 q4')
    
    # Model the forward kinematics equations
    # These equations are derived from the transformation matrices
    eq1 = Eq(x, q1 + q2)  # Example equation for x
    eq2 = Eq(y, q3 + q4)  # Example equation for y
    eq3 = Eq(z, q2 + q3)  # Example equation for z
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (q1, q2, q3, q4))
    
    # Extract the solutions
    q1_val = solution[q1]
    q2_val = solution[q2]
    q3_val = solution[q3]
    q4_val = solution[q4]
    
    return (float(q1_val), float(q2_val), float(q3_val), float(q4_val))
```

This function models the forward kinematics, sets up the equations, solves for the joint angles, and returns them as a tuple. Note that the actual implementation would require the correct forward kinematics equations based on the robot's specific geometry and joint configurations.
