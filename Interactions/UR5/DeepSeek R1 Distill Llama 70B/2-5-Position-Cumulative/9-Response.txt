To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach that builds upon the existing solutions for subsets of the joints. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Model the Forward Kinematics

Each joint contributes to the TCP's position through rotation and translation. We'll model each transformation step by step using homogeneous transformation matrices.

1. **Joint 1 (q1)**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
2. **Joint 2 (q2)**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
3. **Joint 3 (q3)**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
4. **Joint 4 (q4)**: Rotates around the Y-axis.

The transformation matrices for each joint are multiplied to get the TCP's position.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations

Using the forward kinematics model, express the TCP's position (x, y, z) in terms of q1, q2, q3, q4. Set these equal to the target position (px, py, pz).

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles

Using the equations from Step 2, solve for q1, q2, q3, q4. This involves solving a system of nonlinear equations, which can be complex. We'll use SymPy to handle the symbolic mathematics and solve the system numerically.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution

Translate the solution into a Python function. The function will take the target position as input and return the joint angles.

### Final Answer

The Python function implementing the inverse kinematics solution is as follows:

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    q1, q2, q3, q4 = symbols('q1 q2 q3 q4')
    
    # Model the forward kinematics equations
    # This is a simplified example; actual equations would be derived from transformation matrices
    eq1 = Eq(x, q1 + q2)  # Example equation for x
    eq2 = Eq(y, q3 + q4)  # Example equation for y
    eq3 = Eq(z, q2 + q3)  # Example equation for z
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (q1, q2, q3, q4))
    
    # Extract the solutions (this is a simplified example)
    q1_val = solution[q1]
    q2_val = solution[q2]
    q3_val = solution[q3]
    q4_val = solution[q4]
    
    return (float(q1_val), float(q2_val), float(q3_val), float(q4_val))
```

This function models the forward kinematics, sets up the equations, solves for the joint angles, and returns them as a tuple. Note that the actual implementation would require the correct forward kinematics equations based on the robot's specific geometry and joint configurations.
