To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we can break the problem into two parts: solving for the first two joints and then solving for the last two joints based on the remaining position. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Solve for the first two joints (theta1 and theta2):**
   - Use the existing solution for the first two joints to find theta1 and theta2 based on the target position.

2. **Calculate the position relative to the third joint:**
   - Using theta1 and theta2, compute the position of the third joint.

3. **Solve for the last two joints (theta3 and theta4):**
   - Use the existing solution for the last two joints, adjusting for the current robot's structure to find theta3 and theta4 based on the remaining position.

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Solve for the first two joints using the existing solution
    theta1, theta2 = inverse_kinematics_joints_1_2(p)
    
    # Calculate the position relative to joint 3
    x, y, z = p
    # Adjust for joint 2's position
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for the last two joints
    theta3, theta4 = inverse_kinematics_joints_3_4((adjusted_x, y, adjusted_z))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)

def inverse_kinematics_joints_1_2(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    return (theta1, theta2)

def inverse_kinematics_joints_3_4(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    theta3 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    theta4 = 0.0
    return (theta3, theta4)
```

This approach leverages existing solutions for sub-chains to simplify the problem, ensuring each part is manageable and the overall solution is accurate.
