To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we follow a systematic approach:

1. **Define DH Parameters**: Assign Denavit-Hartenberg parameters to each joint based on the robot's structure.

2. **Write Forward Kinematics Equations**: Use the DH parameters to express the position of the TCP in terms of the joint angles.

3. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the computed TCP position to the desired position `p`.

4. **Solve for Joint Angles**: Manipulate the equations to solve for the joint angles θ1, θ2, θ3, and θ4.

5. **Implement the Solution**: Translate the derived equations into the `inverse_kinematics` function.

**Step 1: Define DH Parameters**

| Joint | α (°) | a (m) | d (m) | θ   |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| 1     | 90    | 0     | 0.39225 | θ1 |
| 2     | 90    | 0.093 | 0     | θ2 |
| 3     | 0     | 0     | 0.09465 | θ3 |
| 4     | 90    | 0     | 0     | θ4 |

---

**Step 2: Write Forward Kinematics Equations**

Using the DH parameters, the transformation matrices from the base to each joint and the TCP can be written. The position of the TCP is obtained by multiplying these matrices.

---

**Step 3: Set Up Equations**

Set the computed TCP position equal to the desired position `p = [x, y, z]`.

---

**Step 4: Solve for Joint Angles**

Given the complexity of the equations, we'll use SymPy to solve the system of nonlinear equations for θ1, θ2, θ3, and θ4.

---

**Step 5: Implement the Solution**

Translate the derived equations into the `inverse_kinematics` function to compute the joint angles for a given position `p`.

---

By following these steps, we can derive the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, thus solving the inverse kinematics problem for the 4-DOF manipulator.
