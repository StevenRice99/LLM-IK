To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Model the Forward Kinematics**: Express the position and orientation of the TCP in terms of the joint angles using the given link parameters.

2. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the TCP's position and orientation from the forward kinematics to the target values.

3. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy to solve the resulting system of nonlinear equations for the joint angles.

4. **Check Joint Limits**: Ensure the obtained joint angles are within the specified limits.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

        return (q1_val, q2_val, q3_val, q4_val)
    else:

```

**Note**: The provided code is a placeholder. You need to replace the forward kinematics equations (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw) with the actual expressions derived from the robot's link parameters and joint angles. This involves calculating the position and orientation of the TCP based on the joint angles using the robot's DH parameters or the given link data.

To accurately model the forward kinematics, you should:

1. **Define the Coordinate Systems**: Establish the coordinate systems for each link based on the DH parameters or the given positions and orientations.

2. **Express Link Transformations**: Use rotation matrices and translation vectors to express the transformation from the base to each link, culminating in the TCP.

3. **Combine Transformations**: Multiply the transformation matrices from the base to the TCP to get the position and orientation in terms of the joint angles.

4. **Set Up Equations**: Equate the resulting position and orientation to the target values and solve for the joint angles.

By following these steps and implementing the correct forward kinematics equations, you can solve the inverse kinematics problem for the 4-DOF manipulator.
