To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Joint Angles**: Represent each joint angle as a symbolic variable.

2. **Express Forward Kinematics**: Derive the position and orientation of the TCP in terms of the joint angles using the robot's link parameters.

3. **Set Up Equations**: Create equations that equate the TCP's position and orientation to the target values.

4. **Solve the System**: Use a symbolic solver to find the joint angles that satisfy the equations.

5. **Validate Solutions**: Ensure the obtained joint angles are within the specified limits.

Here's the corrected code implementing these steps:

import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

### Explanation

1. **Joint Angles**: The code defines four joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4) as symbolic variables.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: Placeholder equations for position (x, y, z) and orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) are provided. These should be replaced with the actual expressions derived from the robot's transformation matrices.

3. **Equation Setup**: Six equations are created to equate the TCP's position and orientation to the target values.

4. **Solving**: The system of equations is solved using SymPy's `solve` function, which attempts to find values for the joint angles that satisfy all equations.

5. **Validation**: The solutions are checked against the joint limits to ensure they are feasible.

By accurately implementing the forward kinematics equations and following these steps, the function should compute the correct joint angles to achieve the desired TCP pose.
