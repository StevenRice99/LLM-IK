To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the given 1 degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired target position p = [x, y, z]. 

Given the TCP's local position is [0, 0.093, 0], rotating the joint around the Y-axis by θ will move the TCP in the X-Z plane. The relationship between the joint angle θ and the TCP's world coordinates can be described as:

- x = 0.093 * sin(θ)
- z = 0.093 * cos(θ)

Using these equations, we can solve for θ using the arctangent function, considering the signs of x and z to determine the correct quadrant.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of x and z
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)
    return theta
```

This function computes the necessary joint angle θ to move the TCP to the desired position p.
