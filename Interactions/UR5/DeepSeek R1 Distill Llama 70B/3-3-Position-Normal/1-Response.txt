To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1 degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the target position p = [x, y, z]. 

Given that the TCP's local position is [0, 0.093, 0], rotating the joint around the Y-axis by angle θ will move the TCP in the X-Z plane. The global position of the TCP can be expressed as:
- x = 0.093 * cosθ
- z = 0.093 * sinθ

The y-coordinate of the TCP remains constant at 0.093. Therefore, given a target position [x, y, z], we can solve for θ using the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant.

Here is the implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of z/x
    theta = math.atan2(z, x)
    return theta
```
