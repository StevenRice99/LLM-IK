To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the target position p = [x, y, z]. 

Given the TCP's local position [0, 0.093, 0] and its rotation around the Y-axis, the global position of the TCP can be expressed as:
- x = 0.093 * sin(θ)
- z = 0.093 * cos(θ)

Using these equations, we can solve for θ using the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant with atan2.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)
    return theta
```
