To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate theta1** using the z-coordinate of the target position.
2. **Determine sin(theta1)** once theta1 is known.
3. **Compute intermediate values C and D** based on the target's x and y coordinates.
4. **Solve for cos(theta2) and sin(theta2)** using the derived equations.
5. **Calculate theta2** using the arctangent function.

Here is the Python function implementing these steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate theta1 from z
    theta1 = math.acos(z / 0.00165)
    S = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Calculate C and D
    A = 0.093
    B = 0.09465
    C = (x - S * B) / A
    D = (y - B) / A
    
    # Calculate cos(theta2) and sin(theta2)
    denominator = S**2 + 1
    cos_theta2 = (D + S * C) / denominator
    sin_theta2 = (S * D - C) / denominator
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function computes the necessary joint angles to reach the desired TCP position using analytical methods without optimization.
