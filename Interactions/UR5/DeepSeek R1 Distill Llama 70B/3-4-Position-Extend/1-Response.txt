To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired coordinates. The approach involves deriving the joint angles using trigonometric identities and solving a system of equations.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The manipulator has two revolute joints. The first joint rotates around the Y-axis, and the second around the Z-axis. The TCP's position is determined by the angles of these joints.
2. **Forward Kinematics**: Express the TCP's position in terms of the joint angles using rotation matrices.
3. **System of Equations**: Derive two equations based on the TCP's x and y coordinates.
4. **Trigonometric Identities**: Use the law of cosines and trigonometric identities to solve for the joint angles.
5. **Implementation**: Translate the derived equations into code to compute the joint angles.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    A = 0.093  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.09465  # Length of the second link including TCP

    # Calculate intermediate terms
    C = A**2 - B**2 - px**2 - py**2
    D = C / (2 * B)
    E = math.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)
    
    # Handle the case where E is zero to avoid division by zero
    if E == 0:
        alpha = 0.0
    else:
        alpha = math.atan2(py, px)
    
    sin_theta = D / E
    # Ensure sin_theta is within valid range
    sin_theta = max(min(sin_theta, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta2 = alpha + math.asin(sin_theta)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the equations derived
    sin_theta1 = (px + B * math.sin(theta2)) / A
    cos_theta1 = (py - B * math.cos(theta2)) / A
    
    # Ensure the values are within valid range for atan2
    sin_theta1 = max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cos_theta1 = max(min(cos_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Extract Position**: The desired position `p` is split into `px`, `py`, and `pz`.
2. **Constants**: Define the lengths of the links `A` and `B`.
3. **Intermediate Calculations**: Compute terms `C`, `D`, and `E` to simplify the equations.
4. **Angle Calculation**: Use `atan2` to find the initial angle `alpha` and solve for `theta2` using the arcsine function.
5. **Joint Angles**: Calculate `theta1` using the derived trigonometric equations and ensure the values are within valid ranges.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem using analytical methods, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.
