To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired location p. 

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (θ2) rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is located at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics Analysis**: By analyzing the transformation matrices, we find that the position of the TCP in the base frame is determined by θ1, while θ2 does not affect the position but influences the orientation. The TCP's position in the base frame is given by:
   - x = 0.09465 * sin(θ1)
   - y = 0.093
   - z = 0.09465 * cos(θ1)

3. **Inverse Kinematics Solution**: Given a desired position p = [px, py, pz], we solve for θ1 using the x and z components. Since θ2 does not affect the position, it can be set to any value, typically 0.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    # Calculate theta1 using the arctangent of x and z components
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    # Theta2 can be set to any value since it doesn't affect the position
    theta2 = 0.0
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **θ1 Calculation**: Using `atan2(px, pz)`, we determine θ1 to position the TCP correctly in the X-Z plane.
- **θ2**: Since θ2 does not affect the TCP's position, it's set to 0.0. This could be adjusted if orientation is considered, but for position-only inverse kinematics, it's unnecessary.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by focusing on the necessary joint movements to reach the desired TCP position.
