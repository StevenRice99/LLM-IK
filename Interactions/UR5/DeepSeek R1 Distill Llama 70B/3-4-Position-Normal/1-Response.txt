To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates [x, y, z]. The solution involves deriving the joint angles from the given position using geometric and trigonometric relationships.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (θ2) rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is located at a fixed height above the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: The position of the TCP in the base frame is determined by the transformations applied by each joint. The TCP's position is derived using rotation matrices and translation vectors.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**: Given the desired TCP position, we derive the joint angles by solving the equations obtained from the forward kinematics. The steps are:
   - Compute θ1 using the z-coordinate.
   - Use θ1 to compute the necessary terms for solving θ2.
   - Solve for θ2 using the x and y coordinates.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    z0 = 0.09465  # Fixed height of the TCP

    # Calculate theta1 using the z-coordinate
    cos_theta1 = z / z0
    theta1 = math.acos(cos_theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta1 ** 2)

    # Calculate coefficients A and B
    A = z0 * sin_theta1
    B = 0.093  # Distance from joint1 to joint2 along Y

    # Compute the denominator to avoid division by zero
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    if denominator == 0:
        raise ValueError("Denominator is zero, which is unexpected.")

    # Calculate cos(theta2) and sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = (A * x + B * y) / denominator
    sin_theta2 = (A * y - B * x) / denominator

    # Calculate theta2 using arctangent
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Compute θ1**: Using the z-coordinate of the desired position, we determine θ1 by taking the arccosine of the ratio of z to the fixed TCP height (z0). This gives the angle needed to rotate the first joint to achieve the desired height.

2. **Compute A and B**: These coefficients represent the contributions of θ1 and the fixed distance between the joints, respectively. They are used to form the equations for the x and y coordinates.

3. **Solve for θ2**: Using the derived coefficients and the desired x and y coordinates, we set up equations to solve for cos(θ2) and sin(θ2). Using the arctangent function, we determine θ2, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable geometric and trigonometric steps, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position accurately.
