To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates p = [x, y, z]. 

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second (θ2) around the Z-axis. The TCP is fixed at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the second link.

2. **Forward Kinematics Insight**: 
   - The position of the second link in the global frame after rotating θ1 around Y is [0.093*sinθ1, 0.093, 0.093*cosθ1].
   - The TCP's global position is this position plus the effect of rotating the TCP's relative position by θ2 around Z. However, since the TCP is along the Z-axis, rotating it around Z doesn't change its position. Thus, θ2 can be set to 0 as it doesn't affect the TCP's position.

3. **Formulate Equations**:
   - From the x-coordinate: x = 0.093*sinθ1 → sinθ1 = x / 0.093
   - From the z-coordinate: z = 0.093*cosθ1 + 0.09465 → cosθ1 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.093

4. **Determine θ1**:
   - Use arcsin to find θ1 from sinθ1.
   - Adjust θ1 to the correct quadrant based on the sign of cosθ1.

5. **Set θ2**: Since θ2 doesn't affect the TCP's position, set it to 0.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate sin(theta1) and cos(theta1) based on the desired position
    sin_theta1 = x / 0.093
    cos_theta1 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.093
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arcsin and adjust to the correct quadrant
    theta1 = math.asin(sin_theta1)
    if cos_theta1 < 0:
        theta1 = math.pi - theta1
    
    # Theta2 can be set to any value as it doesn't affect the TCP position
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **sin_theta1 and cos_theta1**: These are derived from the x and z components of the target position, considering the known link lengths and TCP offset.
- **Quadrant Adjustment**: Ensures θ1 is in the correct quadrant by checking the sign of cos_theta1.
- **Theta2**: Set to 0 as it doesn't influence the TCP's position.

This approach efficiently computes the necessary joint angles to reach any reachable target position, leveraging geometric relationships and trigonometric functions.
