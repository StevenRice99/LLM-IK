To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (p_x, p_y, p_z). The solution involves solving a system of nonlinear equations derived from the forward kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Extract the Desired Position**: Unpack the target position (p_x, p_y, p_z).
2. **Calculate θ2**: Use the y-component of the position to find θ2 using the arccosine function.
3. **Compute Sin(θ2)**: Determine the sine of θ2 from the cosine value.
4. **Normalize Coordinates**: Normalize the x and z coordinates by dividing by the length of the second link.
5. **Solve for Sin(θ1) and Cos(θ1)**: Use the normalized coordinates and sin(θ2) to solve for sin(θ1) and cos(θ1).
6. **Determine θ1**: Use the arctangent function to find θ1 from sin(θ1) and cos(θ1).

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    p_x, p_y, p_z = p

    # Constants
    A = 0.09465  # Length of the second link
    L = 0.093    # Length of the first link

    # Calculate theta2 using p_y
    cos_theta2 = (p_y - L) / A
    # Clamp to avoid numerical issues
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)

    # Normalize x and z by A
    x = p_x / A
    z = p_z / A

    # Calculate sin(theta1) and cos(theta1)
    denominator = 1 + sin_theta2 ** 2
    sin_theta1 = (x + sin_theta2 * z) / denominator
    cos_theta1 = (z - sin_theta2 * x) / denominator

    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Extract Position**: The target position (p_x, p_y, p_z) is extracted from the input tuple.
2. **Compute θ2**: Using the y-component of the target position, we calculate θ2 by solving for the arccosine of ((p_y - L) / A), where L is the length of the first link and A is the length of the second link.
3. **Determine Sin(θ2)**: The sine of θ2 is derived from the cosine value to maintain the correct quadrant.
4. **Normalize Coordinates**: The x and z coordinates are normalized by dividing by the length of the second link to simplify the equations.
5. **Solve for Sin(θ1) and Cos(θ1)**: Using the normalized coordinates and sin(θ2), we solve for sin(θ1) and cos(θ1) by rearranging the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics.
6. **Calculate θ1**: The arctangent function is used to find θ1 from the computed sine and cosine values, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, ensuring accuracy and correctness for all reachable target positions.
