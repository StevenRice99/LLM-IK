To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (p_x, p_y, p_z). The solution involves solving a system of nonlinear equations derived from the forward kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Extract the Desired Position**: Unpack the target position (p_x, p_y, p_z).
2. **Calculate θ2**: Use the z-component of the target position to find θ2 using the arccosine function.
3. **Compute C and D**: Calculate C as the sum of the first link length and the product of the second link length and the cosine of θ2. Calculate D as the product of the second link length and the sine of θ2.
4. **Solve for sin(θ1) and cos(θ1)**: Use the derived formulas to compute the sine and cosine of θ1.
5. **Calculate θ1**: Use the arctangent function to find θ1 from the computed sine and cosine values, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    p_x, p_y, p_z = p

    # Constants
    L1 = 0.093    # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of the second link

    # Calculate theta2 using p_z
    cos_theta2 = (p_z - L1) / L2
    # Clamp to avoid numerical issues
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)

    # Compute C and D
    C = L1 + L2 * cos_theta2
    D = L2 * sin_theta2

    # Compute sin(theta1) and cos(theta1)
    if C == 0 or D == 0:
        raise ValueError("C or D is zero; unable to compute theta1.")
    
    sin_theta1 = (p_x + p_y) / (2 * C)
    cos_theta1 = (p_x - p_y) / (2 * D)

    # Ensure sin^2(theta1) + cos^2(theta1) = 1
    norm = math.sqrt(sin_theta1 ** 2 + cos_theta1 ** 2)
    if norm != 0:
        sin_theta1 /= norm
        cos_theta1 /= norm

    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Extract Position**: The target position (p_x, p_y, p_z) is extracted from the input tuple.
2. **Compute θ2**: Using the z-component of the target position, θ2 is calculated using the arccosine function, ensuring the value is within the valid range.
3. **Calculate C and D**: These values are derived from the link lengths and the computed θ2, representing intermediate terms used in solving for θ1.
4. **Solve for sin(θ1) and cos(θ1)**: Using the derived formulas, the sine and cosine of θ1 are computed, ensuring the solution is within the valid range.
5. **Calculate θ1**: The arctangent function is used to find θ1 from the computed sine and cosine values, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, ensuring accuracy and correctness for all reachable target positions.
