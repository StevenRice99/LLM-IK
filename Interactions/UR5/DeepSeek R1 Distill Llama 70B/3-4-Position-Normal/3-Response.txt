To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem accurately, we need to correctly derive the joint angles θ1 and θ2 based on the desired TCP position. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (θ2) rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is located at a fixed height above the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: The position of the TCP in the base frame is determined by the transformations applied by each joint. The TCP's position is derived using rotation matrices and translation vectors.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**: Given the desired TCP position, we derive the joint angles by solving the equations obtained from the forward kinematics. The steps are:
   - Compute θ1 using the z-coordinate.
   - Use θ1 to compute the necessary terms for solving θ2.
   - Solve for θ2 using the x and y coordinates.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.093  # Distance from joint1 to joint2
    L2 = 0.09465  # Fixed height of the TCP

    # Calculate theta1 using the z-coordinate
    theta1 = math.asin(z / L2)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the X-Y plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r - L1) / L2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Compute θ1**: Using the z-coordinate of the desired position, we determine θ1 by taking the arcsine of the ratio of z to the fixed TCP height (L2). This gives the angle needed to rotate the first joint to achieve the desired height.

2. **Compute Distance in X-Y Plane**: Calculate the radial distance from the origin to the desired TCP position in the X-Y plane using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Solve for θ2**: Using the radial distance and the known lengths of the links, compute the cosine of θ2. Then, use the arccosine function to find θ2, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable geometric and trigonometric steps, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position accurately.
