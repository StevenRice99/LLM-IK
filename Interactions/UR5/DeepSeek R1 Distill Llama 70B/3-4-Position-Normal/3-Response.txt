To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robotic arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at a specified target position (x, y, z). The robot's structure allows us to derive the joint angles analytically.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (θ2) rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is fixed at a height of 0.09465 units above the second joint.

2. **Express TCP Position**: The position of the TCP can be expressed in terms of the joint angles:
   - **x** = -0.093 * sin(θ2) * cos(θ1)
   - **y** = 0.093 * cos(θ2) * cos(θ1)
   - **z** = 0.093 * sin(θ1) + 0.09465

3. **Solve for θ1**: Using the z-coordinate of the target position, solve for θ1:
   \[
   \sin(\theta1) = \frac{z - 0.09465}{0.093}
   \]
   \[
   \theta1 = \arcsin\left(\frac{z - 0.09465}{0.093}\right)
   \]

4. **Solve for θ2**: Using the x and y coordinates, solve for θ2:
   \[
   \theta2 = \arctan2(-x, y)
   \]

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 from the z-coordinate
    sin_theta1 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.093
    theta1 = math.asin(sin_theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2 from x and y coordinates
    theta2 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **θ1 Calculation**: The angle θ1 is determined by the vertical position (z-coordinate). The sine of θ1 is derived from the difference between the target z and the fixed TCP height, scaled by the length of the first joint.
- **θ2 Calculation**: The angle θ2 is determined by the horizontal position (x and y coordinates). Using the arctangent function with the negative x and positive y values gives the correct angle in the appropriate quadrant.

This approach efficiently computes the required joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, considering the robot's structure and constraints.
