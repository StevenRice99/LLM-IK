To resolve the "math domainerror" when calling `math.asin()`, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.asin()` is within the valid range of `[-1, 1]`. This error occurs when `sin_theta1` exceeds these bounds, which can happen if the target position is not reachable or if there are rounding errors in the calculations.

Here's the modified code with a check to clamp `sin_theta1` within the valid range:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate sin(theta1) and cos(theta1) based on the desired position
    sin_theta1 = x / 0.093
    cos_theta1 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.093
    
    # Clamp sin_theta1 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain error
    sin_theta1 = max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arcsin and adjust to the correct quadrant
    theta1 = math.asin(sin_theta1)
    if cos_theta1 < 0:
        theta1 = math.pi - theta1
    
    # Theta2 can be set to any value as it doesn't affect the TCP position
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Clamping `sin_theta1`**: Before calling `math.asin()`, we ensure `sin_theta1` is within `[-1, 1]` using `max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)`. This prevents the "math domain error" by guaranteeing valid input to `math.asin()`.
2. **Quadrant Adjustment**: The adjustment based on the sign of `cos_theta1` remains to ensure `theta1` is in the correct quadrant.
3. **Theta2**: As before, `theta2` is set to `0.0` since it does not affect the TCP's position.

This modification ensures the function handles edge cases gracefully while maintaining the integrity of the inverse kinematics solution.
