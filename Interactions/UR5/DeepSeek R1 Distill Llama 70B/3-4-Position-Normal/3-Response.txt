To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (p_x, p_y, p_z). The solution involves solving a system of nonlinear equations derived from the forward kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Extract the Desired Position**: Unpack the target position (p_x, p_y, p_z).
2. **Calculate θ1**: Use the z-component of the target position to find θ1 using the arccosine function.
3. **Compute A and B**: Calculate A as the product of L2 and the sine of θ1, and B as the length of the first link.
4. **Handle Special Cases**: If the target is near the Y-axis (x ≈ 0), set θ2 to 0 to handle this special case.
5. **Solve for θ2**: Use the arctangent function to find θ2 from the computed values of A, B, x, and y.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    p_x, p_y, p_z = p

    # Constants
    L1 = 0.093    # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of the second link

    # Calculate theta1 using z-component
    cos_theta1 = p_z / L2
    # Ensure cos_theta1 is within valid range
    cos_theta1 = max(min(cos_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1 = math.acos(cos_theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta1 ** 2)

    A = L2 * sin_theta1
    B = L1

    # Handle the special case where the target is near the Y-axis
    epsilon = 0.001
    if abs(p_x) < epsilon:
        theta2 = 0.0
    else:
        # Calculate theta2 using the arctangent of (A y - B x) / (A x + B y)
        numerator = A * p_y - B * p_x
        denominator = A * p_x + B * p_y
        theta2 = math.atan2(numerator, denominator)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Extract Position**: The target position (p_x, p_y, p_z) is extracted from the input tuple.
2. **Compute θ1**: Using the z-component of the target position, θ1 is calculated using the arccosine function, ensuring the value is within the valid range.
3. **Calculate A and B**: A is derived from the length of the second link and the sine of θ1, while B is the length of the first link.
4. **Special Case Handling**: If the target's x-component is near zero, θ2 is set to 0 to handle targets along the Y-axis.
5. **Solve for θ2**: Using the arctangent function, θ2 is determined from the computed numerator and denominator, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, ensuring accuracy and correctness for all reachable target positions.
