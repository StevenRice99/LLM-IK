To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates [x, y, z]. The solution involves deriving the joint angles from the given position using geometric and trigonometric relationships.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (θ2) rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is located at a fixed height above the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: The position of the TCP in the base frame is determined by the transformations applied by each joint. The TCP's position is derived using rotation matrices and translation vectors.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**: Given the desired TCP position, we derive the joint angles by solving the equations obtained from the forward kinematics. The steps are:
   - Compute θ1 using the z-coordinate.
   - Use θ1 to compute the necessary terms for solving θ2.
   - Solve for θ2 using the x and y coordinates.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.093   # Distance from joint1 to joint2 along Y-axis
    L2 = 0.09465 # Fixed height of the TCP

    # Calculate theta1 using the z-coordinate
    theta1 = math.asin(z / L1)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the x-coordinate
    theta2 = math.asin(-x / L2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Compute θ1**: Using the z-coordinate of the desired position, we determine θ1 by taking the arcsine of the ratio of z to the fixed TCP height (L1). This gives the angle needed to rotate the first joint to achieve the desired height.

2. **Compute θ2**: Using the x-coordinate of the desired position, we determine θ2 by taking the arcsine of the negative ratio of x to the fixed TCP height (L2). This gives the angle needed to rotate the second joint to achieve the desired position in the X-Y plane.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by breaking it down into manageable geometric and trigonometric steps, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position accurately.
