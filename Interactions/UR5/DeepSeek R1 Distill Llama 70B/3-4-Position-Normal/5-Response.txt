To resolve the "math domainerror" when using `math.asin()`, we need to ensure that the input to the function is within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by clamping the calculated `sin_theta1` value before passing it to `math.asin()`. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 from the z-coordinate, clamping the value to prevent domain errors
    sin_theta1 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.093
    sin_theta1 = max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)  # Ensure sin_theta1 is within [-1, 1]
    theta1 = math.asin(sin_theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2 from x and y coordinates
    theta2 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

1. **Clamping `sin_theta1`:**
   - Added a line to clamp `sin_theta1` between -1.0 and 1.0 using `max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)`.
   - This ensures that the input to `math.asin()` is always within the valid domain, preventing the ValueError.

2. **Maintaining the Original Logic:**
   - The calculation for `theta2` remains unchanged as it correctly determines the angle using `math.atan2(-x, y)`.

This modification ensures that the inverse kinematics function handles all valid target positions without encountering domain errors, providing a robust solution for the given robotic arm setup.
