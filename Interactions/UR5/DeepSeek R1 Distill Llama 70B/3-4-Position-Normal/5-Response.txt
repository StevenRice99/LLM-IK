To resolve the inaccuraciesin the inverse kinematics solution, we'll reformulate the approach using the arctangent function to better handle the quadrants and geometric relationships.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second (θ2) around the Z-axis. The TCP is fixed at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the second link.

2. **Forward Kinematics Insight**: 
   - The position of the second link in the global frame after rotating θ1 around Y is [0.093*sinθ1, 0.093, 0.093*cosθ1].
   - The TCP's global position is this position plus the effect of rotating the TCP's relative position by θ2 around Z. However, since the TCP is along the Z-axis, rotating it around Z doesn't change its position. Thus, θ2 can be set to 0 as it doesn't affect the TCP's position.

3. **Formulate Equations**:
   - From the x and z coordinates: θ1 = arctan(x / (z + 0.09465))
   - This approach uses arctangent to handle all quadrants correctly.

4. **Determine θ1**:
   - Use arctangent to find θ1, ensuring the angle is in the correct quadrant based on the signs of x and z.

5. **Set θ2**: Since θ2 doesn't affect the TCP's position, set it to 0.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent to handle all quadrants
    theta1 = math.atan(x / (z + 0.09465))
    
    # Theta2 can be set to any value as it doesn't affect the TCP position
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Arctangent Calculation**: By using `math.atan(x / (z + 0.09465))`, we correctly determine θ1 in the appropriate quadrant based on the signs of x and z, ensuring accurate joint angle calculation.
- **Quadrant Handling**: The arctangent function inherently handles the correct quadrant, eliminating the need for additional adjustments based on the cosine value.
- **Theta2**: As before, θ2 is set to 0.0 since it doesn't influence the TCP's position.

This revised approach should provide more accurate joint angles, aligning with the correct solutions and ensuring the TCP reaches the desired positions effectively.
