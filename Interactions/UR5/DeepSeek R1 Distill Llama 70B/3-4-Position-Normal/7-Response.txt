To resolve the inaccuraciesin the inverse kinematics solution, we'll reformulate the approach by correctly calculating the joint angles using both sine and cosine values, ensuring the angles are in the correct quadrants.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second (θ2) around the Z-axis. The TCP is fixed at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the second link.

2. **Formulate Equations**:
   - From the x-coordinate: \( x = 0.093 \cdot \sin\theta1 \)
   - From the z-coordinate: \( z = 0.093 \cdot \cos\theta1 + 0.09465 \)

3. **Calculate θ1**:
   - Compute \( \sin\theta1 = \frac{x}{0.093} \)
   - Compute \( \cos\theta1 = \frac{z - 0.09465}{0.093} \)
   - Clamp these values to the range `[-1, 1]` to avoid math domain errors.
   - Use `math.atan2` to find θ1, ensuring the correct quadrant based on the signs of x and z.

4. **Set θ2**: Since θ2 doesn't affect the TCP's position, set it to 0.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate sin(theta1) and cos(theta1) based on the desired position
    sin_theta1 = x / 0.093
    cos_theta1 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.093
    
    # Clamp sin_theta1 and cos_theta1 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    sin_theta1 = max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cos_theta1 = max(min(cos_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using atan2 to handle all quadrants correctly
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Theta2 can be set to any value as it doesn't affect the TCP position
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Clamping Values**: `sin_theta1` and `cos_theta1` are clamped to `[-1, 1]` to prevent domain errors in trigonometric functions.
- **Using atan2**: The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to correctly determine the quadrant of θ1 based on the signs of `sin_theta1` and `cos_theta1`.
- **Theta2**: As before, θ2 is set to 0 since it doesn't influence the TCP's position.

This revised approach ensures accurate calculation of θ1, considering the correct quadrant and handling edge cases gracefully.
