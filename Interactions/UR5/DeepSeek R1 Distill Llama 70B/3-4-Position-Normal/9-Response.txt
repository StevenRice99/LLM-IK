To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robotic arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at a specified target position (x, y, z). The robot's structure allows us to derive the joint angles analytically.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (θ1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (θ2) rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is fixed at a height of 0.09465 units above the second joint.

2. **Express TCP Position**: The position of the TCP can be expressed in terms of the joint angles:
   - **x** = 0.093 * cos(θ1) + 0.09465 * cos(θ1 + θ2)
   - **y** = 0.093 * sin(θ1) + 0.09465 * sin(θ1 + θ2)
   - **z** = 0.09465 (fixed)

3. **Solve for θ1 and θ2**:
   - Rearrange the equations to express cos(θ1 + θ2) and sin(θ1 + θ2) in terms of x, y, and θ1.
   - Use the identity cos²(θ1 + θ2) + sin²(θ1 + θ2) = 1 to form a single equation in terms of θ1.
   - Solve for θ1 using the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant.
   - Substitute θ1 back into the equations to solve for θ2.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Given the fixed height of the TCP, we can ignore z as it's always 0.09465
    # We focus on solving for x and y
    
    # Define constants
    l1 = 0.093       # Length of the first link
    l2 = 0.09465     # Length of the second link (TCP)
    
    # Calculate the effective lengths ratio
    ratio = l1 / l2
    
    # Calculate the target position relative to the second joint
    x_relative = x / l2
    y_relative = y / l2
    
    # Use the arctangent to find theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_relative, y_relative)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the arctangent of the remaining component
    theta2 = math.atan2((x - l1 * math.sin(theta1)), (y - l1 * math.cos(theta1)))
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Understanding the Robot Structure**: The robot's structure is defined by two revolute joints and a fixed TCP height. This allows us to express the TCP's position in terms of the joint angles.
- **Expressing TCP Position**: The TCP's x and y coordinates are functions of both θ1 and θ2, while the z-coordinate is fixed.
- **Solving for θ1 and θ2**: By rearranging the equations and using trigonometric identities, we can solve for θ1 and θ2. The use of `math.atan2` ensures that the correct quadrant is considered for both angles, providing accurate solutions.

This approach efficiently computes the required joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, considering the robot's structure and constraints.
