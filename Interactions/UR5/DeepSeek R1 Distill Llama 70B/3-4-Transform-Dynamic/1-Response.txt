To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired position and orientation. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Compute θ1 from the Position:**
   - The position of the TCP is given by (x, y, z). Since the robot can only reach positions where y=0, we focus on x and z.
   - Using the geometry of the robot, θ1 is calculated using the arctangent of (z - L2) over x, where L1 and L2 are the lengths of the links.

2. **Compute the Desired Rotation Matrix:**
   - Convert the desired Euler angles (rx, ry, rz) into a rotation matrix using the ZYX convention.

3. **Determine θ2 from the Orientation:**
   - Using the rotation matrix calculated from the Euler angles, adjust for the rotation around the first joint (θ1) to isolate the rotation around the second joint (θ2).
   - Extract θ2 from the adjusted rotation matrix.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [rx, ry, rz].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    L1 = 0.093  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.09465  # Offset of the TCP from the second joint

    # Calculate theta1 from the position
    theta1 = math.atan2(z - L2, x)

    # Create the desired rotation matrix from Euler angles (ZYX convention)
    # Compute individual rotation matrices
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, math.cos(rx), -math.sin(rx)],
        [0, math.sin(rx), math.cos(rx)]
    ])
    Ry = np.array([
        [math.cos(ry), 0, math.sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(ry), 0, math.cos(ry)]
    ])
    Rz = np.array([
        [math.cos(rz), -math.sin(rz), 0],
        [math.sin(rz), math.cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    R_desired = np.dot(Rz, np.dot(Ry, Rx))

    # Compute the transpose of Ry(theta1) which is Ry(-theta1)
    Ry_T = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta1), 0, math.sin(theta1)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(theta1), 0, math.cos(theta1)]
    ])

    # Calculate Rz(theta2) = Ry_T * R_desired
    Rz_theta2 = np.dot(Ry_T, R_desired)

    # Extract theta2 from the second row of Rz(theta2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(Rz_theta2[1, 0], Rz_theta2[1, 1])

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function first calculates θ1 based on the desired position and then determines θ2 by adjusting the desired orientation for the rotation introduced by θ1, ensuring both the position and orientation are achieved.
