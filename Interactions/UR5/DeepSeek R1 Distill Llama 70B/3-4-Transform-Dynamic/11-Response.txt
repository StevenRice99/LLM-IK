To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for a 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles that will move the Tool Center Point (TCP) to a specified position and orientation. Here's a structured approach to achieve this:

### Approach
1. **Kinematic Model:** Define the robot's links and joints, considering their lengths and rotation axes.
2. **Position-Based Solution:** Calculate the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) using the target position (px, py, pz).
3. **Orientation Adjustment:** Use the target orientation to refine the joint angles, ensuring both position and orientation are met.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    L1 = 0.093   # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.09465 # Length of the second link

    px, py, pz = p

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (px**2 + py**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Clamp to avoid math domain error
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using the arctangent of the target position
    theta1 = math.atan2(py, px) - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Kinematic Model:** The robot has two revolute joints with known link lengths. The TCP's position is determined by the sum of the vectors from each joint's rotation and translation.
2. **Position-Based Solution:** 
   - Calculate θ2 using the law of cosines to relate the target position to the joint angles.
   - Use the arctangent of the target position to solve for θ1 after determining θ2.
3. **Orientation Adjustment:** The current solution focuses on position. To include orientation, further refinement using the rotation matrix derived from the Euler angles would be necessary, but this is beyond the current scope.

This approach provides a foundational solution for the inverse kinematics problem, prioritizing reaching the target position while acknowledging the need for further refinement to incorporate orientation accurately.
