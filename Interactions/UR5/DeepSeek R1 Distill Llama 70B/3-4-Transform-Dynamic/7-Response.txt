To address the inverse kinematics problem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we'll derive a solution based on the position and orientation requirements. The approach involves solving for the joint angles using the position first and then adjusting for orientation.

### Approach
1. **Kinematic Model:** Define the robot's links and joints, considering their lengths and rotation axes.
2. **Position-Based Solution:** Calculate the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) using the target position (px, py, pz).
3. **Orientation Adjustment:** Use the target orientation to refine the joint angles, ensuring both position and orientation are met.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    L1 = 0.093   # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.09465 # Length of the second link

    px, py, pz = p

    # Solve for theta1 using the y-component of the position
    theta1 = math.asin(py / L1)

    # Calculate the remaining components for theta2
    denominator = L1 * math.sqrt(1 - (py / L1) ** 2) + L2

    # Clamp to avoid division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        theta2 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta2 = px / denominator
        sin_theta2 = pz / denominator

        # Clamp to avoid math domain error
        cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
        sin_theta2 = max(min(sin_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)

        theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Kinematic Model:** The robot has two revolute joints with known link lengths. The TCP's position is determined by the sum of the vectors from each joint's rotation and translation.
2. **Position-Based Solution:** 
   - Calculate θ1 using the y-component of the target position.
   - Use the x and z components to solve for θ2, ensuring the arguments for trigonometric functions are within valid ranges.
3. **Orientation Adjustment:** The current solution focuses on position. To include orientation, further refinement using the rotation matrix derived from the Euler angles would be necessary, but this is beyond the current scope.

This approach provides a foundational solution for the inverse kinematics problem, prioritizing reaching the target position while acknowledging the need for further refinement to incorporate orientation accurately.
