To resolve the error, we needto correctly access the solutions from the `sp.solve()` function, which returns a list of dictionaries. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math
import sympy as sp

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    
    # Define the joint angles as symbols
    theta1, theta2 = sp.symbols('theta1 theta2')
    
    # Forward kinematics equations
    # Position
    x = 0.093 * sp.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    y = 0.093 * sp.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    z = 0.09465
    
    # Orientation (assuming ZYX Euler angles)
    roll = theta1
    pitch = theta2
    yaw = 0  # Since it's a 2-DOF arm, yaw is fixed
    
    # Set up the equations
    eq_pos = [
        sp.Eq(x, p[0]),
        sp.Eq(y, p[1]),
        sp.Eq(z, p[2])
    ]
    
    eq_orient = [
        sp.Eq(roll, r[0]),
        sp.Eq(pitch, r[1])
    ]
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = sp.solve(eq_pos + eq_orient, (theta1, theta2))
    
    if not solution:
        raise ValueError("No solution found.")
    
    # Extract the first solution
    first_solution = solution[0]
    
    # Extract the joint angles from the solution dictionary
    theta1_val = first_solution[theta1]
    theta2_val = first_solution[theta2]
    
    return (float(theta1_val), float(theta2_val))
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Check for Solutions:** The code first checks if `solution` is empty and raises an error if no solution is found.
2. **Access First Solution:** It then accesses the first solution in the list using `solution[0]`.
3. **Extract Joint Angles:** Finally, it extracts the values for `theta1` and `theta2` from the first solution dictionary using their symbols as keys.

This approach correctly handles the structure returned by `sp.solve()` and ensures that the joint angles are properly extracted.
