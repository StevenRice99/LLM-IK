To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for both position and orientation, we'll extend the existing solution by incorporating orientation equations. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Forward Kinematics for Position and Orientation**:
   - **Position**: The existing code calculates the end effector's position based on joint angles θ1 and θ2.
   - **Orientation**: The orientation of the TCP is determined by the product of the rotation matrices of the two joints. For joint1 (Y-axis), the rotation matrix is R1, and for joint2 (Z-axis), it's R2. The total orientation is R_total = R2 * R1.

2. **Setting Up Equations**:
   - The desired position (p) and orientation (r) are given. We equate the forward kinematics equations to these desired values.
   - This results in a system of equations: three for position and three for orientation.

3. **Solving the System of Equations**:
   - Using SymPy, we can solve these equations symbolically for θ1 and θ2.
   - The solution will provide the joint angles needed to reach the desired pose.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import math
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, sin, cos

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:

    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    eq2 = Eq(R_total[0][1], R_desired[0][1])
    eq3 = Eq(R_total[0][2], R_desired[0][2])
    
    # Solve the system of equations
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (θ1, θ2))

This function uses SymPy to solve the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics for both position and orientation, providing the necessary joint angles to reach the desired pose.
