To resolve the math domainerrors encountered when using `math.acos` and `math.asin`, we need to ensure that the arguments passed to these functions are within the valid range of [-1, 1]. This can be achieved by clamping the calculated values before using them in the trigonometric functions.

### Approach
1. **Clamp Values**: Before passing the calculated values to `math.acos` and `math.asin`, ensure they are within the range [-1, 1]. This prevents domain errors due to minor numerical inaccuracies.
2. **Calculate Joint Angles**: Use the clamped values to compute the joint angles theta2 and theta3.
3. **Compute Theta1**: Calculate theta1 using the arctangent function as before.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the difference between z and y, with clamping
    cos_theta2 = (z - y) / 0.00165
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp between -1 and 1
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using y and theta2, with clamping
    sin_theta3 = (y - 0.093 * math.cos(theta2)) / 0.0823
    sin_theta3 = max(min(sin_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp between -1 and 1
    theta3 = math.asin(sin_theta3)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using x and the contributions from theta2 and theta3
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
- **Clamping Values**: By clamping `cos_theta2` and `sin_theta3` between -1 and 1, we ensure that the inputs to `math.acos` and `math.asin` are always valid, preventing domain errors.
- **Theta2 Calculation**: The clamped `cos_theta2` is used to find theta2, which adjusts the second joint to position the TCP correctly along the Z and Y axes.
- **Theta3 Calculation**: Using the clamped `sin_theta3`, theta3 is determined to fine-tune the TCP's position along the Y axis.
- **Theta1 Calculation**: Theta1 is calculated to align the TCP along the X and Z axes, completing the positioning.

This approach ensures that the inverse kinematics solution is robust against minor numerical inaccuracies, providing reliable joint angle calculations for reachable target positions.
