To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that position the tool center point (TCP) at a specified target position. The approach involves setting up a system of equations based on the robot's geometry and solving for each joint angle sequentially, ensuring numerical stability.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: Each joint contributes to the TCP's position in 3D space. The first joint (theta1) affects the X and Z coordinates, the second joint (theta2) affects the Y and Z coordinates, and the third joint (theta3) affects all three coordinates.

2. **Set Up Equations**: Express the TCP's position in terms of the joint angles using rotation matrices and the given link lengths and offsets.

3. **Solve Sequentially**:
   - **Theta2**: Solve for theta2 using the difference between the Z and Y coordinates.
   - **Theta3**: Use the Y coordinate and the previously found theta2 to solve for theta3.
   - **Theta1**: Use the X and Z coordinates, considering the contributions from theta2 and theta3, to solve for theta1.

4. **Clamp Values**: Ensure that the arguments passed to trigonometric functions like `math.acos` and `math.asin` are within the valid range of [-1, 1] to prevent domain errors.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the difference between z and y, with clamping
    cos_theta2 = (z - y) / 0.00165
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp between -1 and 1
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using y and theta2, with clamping
    sin_theta3 = (y - 0.093 * math.cos(theta2)) / 0.0823
    sin_theta3 = max(min(sin_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp between -1 and 1
    theta3 = math.asin(sin_theta3)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using x and the contributions from theta2 and theta3
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta2 Calculation**: By subtracting the Y coordinate from the Z coordinate, we isolate the effect of theta2. Using the small difference (0.00165), we find the cosine of theta2 and then compute theta2 using the arccosine function after clamping the value.

2. **Theta3 Calculation**: With theta2 known, we substitute back into the equation for the Y coordinate to solve for the sine of theta3, then use the arcsine function to find theta3 after clamping.

3. **Theta1 Calculation**: Finally, using the X and Z coordinates, we compute theta1 as the arctangent of X over Z, which gives the necessary rotation around the Y-axis to align the TCP with the target position.

This approach ensures that the inverse kinematics solution is robust against minor numerical inaccuracies, providing reliable joint angle calculations for reachable target positions.
