To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach based on the robot's geometry and existing solutions for sub-chains. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**:
   - **Joint 1 (theta1)**: Affects the X and Z coordinates.
   - **Joint 2 (theta2)**: Affects the Y and Z coordinates.
   - **Joint 3 (theta3)**: Affects all three coordinates (X, Y, Z).

2. **Express the TCP Position**:
   Using the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, the TCP's position in terms of joint angles is:
   ```
   x = 0.093 * cos(theta1) * cos(theta2) + 0.0823 * cos(theta1) * cos(theta2 + theta3)
   y = 0.093 * sin(theta1) * cos(theta2) + 0.0823 * sin(theta1) * cos(theta2 + theta3)
   z = 0.09465 + 0.0823 * sin(theta2 + theta3)
   ```

3. **Solve for theta3**:
   From the z-equation:
   ```
   sin(theta2 + theta3) = (z - 0.09465) / 0.0823
   theta2 + theta3 = arcsin((z - 0.09465) / 0.0823)
   ```

4. **Solve for theta2**:
   Using the x and y equations, express theta1 in terms of x and y:
   ```
   theta1 = atan2(y, x)
   ```

5. **Solve for theta3**:
   Substitute theta2 from the previous step into the equation from step 3 to find theta3.

6. **Clamp Values**:
   Ensure that the arguments passed to trigonometric functions like `math.asin` are within the valid range of [-1, 1] to prevent domain errors.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the difference between z and y, with clamping
    cos_theta2 = (z - y) / 0.00165
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp between -1 and 1
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using y and theta2, with clamping
    sin_theta3 = (y - 0.093 * math.cos(theta2)) / 0.0823
    sin_theta3 = max(min(sin_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp between -1 and 1
    theta3 = math.asin(sin_theta3)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using x and the contributions from theta2 and theta3
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Theta2 Calculation**:
   - By subtracting the Y coordinate from the Z coordinate, we isolate the effect of theta2.
   - Using the small difference (0.00165), we find the cosine of theta2 and then compute theta2 using the arccosine function after clamping the value.

2. **Theta3 Calculation**:
   - With theta2 known, we substitute back into the equation for the Y coordinate to solve for the sine of theta3.
   - Use the arcsine function to find theta3 after clamping the value.

3. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - Using the X and Z coordinates, we compute theta1 as the arctangent of X over Z, which gives the necessary rotation around the Y-axis to align the TCP with the target position.

This approach ensures that the inverse kinematics solution is robust against minor numerical inaccuracies, providing reliable joint angle calculations for reachable target positions.
