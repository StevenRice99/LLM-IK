To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we can build upon the existing solution for two joints and extend it to include the third joint. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Use Existing Solution for First Two Joints**: We start by using the provided function that solves for the first two joints (theta1 and theta2) by considering the projection of the target position onto the x-y plane.

2. **Solve for the Third Joint (theta3)**: With theta1 and theta2 determined, we use the z-component of the target position to solve for theta3. This involves isolating theta3 in the equation derived from the z-coordinate.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p for a 3-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    :param p: The target position (x, y, z) for the TCP.
    :return: A tuple of three floats representing the joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3 in radians.
    """
    # First, solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution for the first two joints
    px, py, pz = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, py)
    theta2 = 0.0  # As per the existing solution, theta2 is set to 0
    
    # Now, solve for theta3 using the z-component equation
    # From the z equation: pz = 0.0823 * sin(theta1 + theta3) + 0.09465 * cos(theta1)
    # Rearranged to solve for theta3:
    numerator = pz - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta1)
    denominator = 0.0823
    if abs(numerator / denominator) > 1:
        # Handle cases where the value exceeds the domain of arcsin, but problem states all targets are reachable
        pass
    theta3 = math.asin(numerator / denominator) - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This approach leverages the existing solution for the first two joints and extends it by solving for the third joint using the z-component of the target position. The solution assumes that the target is reachable, as specified in the problem statement.
