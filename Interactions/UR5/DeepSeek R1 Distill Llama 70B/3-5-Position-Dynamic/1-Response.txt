To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Compute φ (θ1 + θ2)** using the desired y-position.
2. **Solve for θ3** using the desired x and z positions.
3. **Set θ1 and θ2** such that their sum equals φ, with θ1 set to 0 for simplicity.

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the desired TCP position [x, y, z].
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of three floats representing the joint angles θ1, θ2, θ3 in radians.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Calculate phi = theta1 + theta2 from the y-component
    cos_phi = (y_d - 0.0823) / 0.093
    phi = math.acos(cos_phi)
    sin_phi = math.sin(phi)

    # Solve for theta3 using the x and z components
    a = 0.093 * sin_phi
    b = 0.09465
    c = -0.093 * sin_phi
    d = 0.09465

    determinant = a * c - b * d

    cos_theta3 = (a * x_d - b * z_d) / determinant
    sin_theta3 = (d * x_d + a * z_d) / determinant

    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Set theta1 and theta2 such that theta1 + theta2 = phi
    # For simplicity, set theta1 = 0 and theta2 = phi
    theta1 = 0.0
    theta2 = phi

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to reach the desired TCP position by breaking down the problem into manageable steps, ensuring the solution is both efficient and correct.
