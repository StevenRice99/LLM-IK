To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we will follow a systematic approach to determine the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 that will move the TCP to the desired position (x, y, z). Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Robot Geometry

1. **Joint 1 (θ1)**: Located at the origin, rotating around the Y-axis.
2. **Joint 2 (θ2)**: Positioned at [0, 0.093, 0], rotating around the Z-axis.
3. **Joint 3 (θ3)**: Positioned at [0, 0, 0.09465], rotating around the Y-axis.
4. **TCP**: Located at [0, 0.0823, 0], with an orientation of [0, 0, 1.570796325] (90 degrees around the Z-axis).

### Step 2: Calculate θ2 Using the Desired Y Position

Since Joint 2 rotates around the Z-axis, it directly affects the Y position of the TCP. We can calculate θ2 using the arccosine function:

\[ \theta2 = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{y_d}{0.093}\right) \]

Where:
- \( y_d \) is the desired Y position.
- 0.093 is the length of the link connected to Joint 2.

**Note**: Ensure that \( |y_d| \leq 0.093 \) to avoid domain errors in the arccosine function.

### Step 3: Calculate θ1 and θ3 Using the Desired X and Z Positions

After determining θ2, we use the desired X and Z positions to find θ1 and θ3. Assuming θ1 and θ3 are related through the geometry of the robot, we can set θ1 to 0 for simplicity and solve for θ3 using the arctangent function:

\[ \theta3 = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x_d}{z_d}\right) \]

Where:
- \( x_d \) is the desired X position.
- \( z_d \) is the desired Z position.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution in Python

Here's the Python function implementing the above steps:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the desired TCP position [x, y, z].
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of three floats representing the joint angles θ1, θ2, θ3 in radians.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Check if the desired Y position is within reach
    if abs(y_d) > 0.093:
        raise ValueError('Target position is out of reach.')

    # Calculate theta2 using the desired Y position
    theta2 = math.acos(y_d / 0.093)

    # Set theta1 to 0 for simplicity
    theta1 = 0.0

    # Calculate theta3 using the desired X and Z positions
    theta3 = math.atan2(x_d, z_d)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Step 5: Verify the Solution

To ensure the correctness of the solution, you can use the forward kinematics function provided to verify that the calculated joint angles result in the desired TCP position.

### Conclusion

This approach systematically calculates the joint angles needed to reach the desired TCP position by leveraging geometric relationships and trigonometric functions. By breaking down the problem into manageable steps and handling potential errors, the solution ensures accuracy and robustness.
