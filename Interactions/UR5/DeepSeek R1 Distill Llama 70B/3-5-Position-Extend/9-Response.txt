To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 3-degree-of-freedom robot arm, we extend the existing solution for a 2-link system to include the third joint. The approach involves solving for the first two joint angles using the position equations and setting the third joint angle to zero, as it does not affect the position.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 such that the TCP reaches a specified position [x, y, z].

2. **Model the Robot:**
   - The robot has three revolute joints with given link parameters and a TCP at the end.

3. **Derive Position Equations:**
   - Express the TCP position in terms of the joint angles using rotation matrices and translations.

4. **Solve for θ2:**
   - Use the y-coordinate equation to solve for θ2.

5. **Solve for θ1:**
   - Use the x and z coordinates to set up a system of equations and solve for θ1.

6. **Set θ3:**
   - Since θ3 does not affect the position, set it to zero.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.09465  # From link 3's z-position
    B = 0.0823    # From link 2's y-position
    
    # Solve for θ2 using the y-coordinate equation
    cosθ2 = (y - 0.093) / 0.0823
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    sinθ2 = math.sin(θ2)
    
    # Set up the matrix M for the x and z equations
    M = [
        [A, -B * sinθ2],
        [B * sinθ2, A]
    ]
    det_M = M[0][0] * M[1][1] - M[0][1] * M[1][0]
    
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [
        [inv_det_M * M[1][1], -inv_det_M * M[0][1]],
        [-inv_det_M * M[1][0], inv_det_M * M[0][0]]
    ]
    
    # Calculate sinθ1 and cosθ1
    sinθ1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z
    cosθ1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z
    
    # Clamp values to avoid numerical issues
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)
    θ3 = 0.0  # θ3 is set to zero as it doesn't affect position
    
    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

This solution extends the existing 2-link inverse kinematics to a 3-link system by solving for θ1 and θ2 using the position equations and setting θ3 to zero, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.
