To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has three revolute joints with given positions, orientations, and axes. The goal is to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at a specified target.

2. **Derive the Forward Kinematics**: Using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, we express the position and orientation of the TCP in terms of the joint angles. This involves calculating the transformation matrices for each joint and combining them.

3. **Set Up Equations for Inverse Kinematics**: Given the target position (x, y, z), we derive equations relating the joint angles to the TCP's position. This involves solving for the angles that satisfy the transformation equations.

4. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - Compute the combined angle φ = θ1 + θ2.
   - Use trigonometric identities to solve for φ using the y and z components.
   - Determine θ3 using the x and z components.
   - Assume θ1 = 0 for simplicity, then solve for θ2 as θ2 = φ - θ1.

5. **Implement the Solution in Code**: Translate the derived equations into a function that computes the joint angles given the target position.

Here is the Python function implementing the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate phi (theta1 + theta2)
    numerator_y = (y - 0.0823)
    denominator = 0.093
    sin_phi = numerator_y / denominator

    A = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    cos_phi = (A - 0.09465) / 0.093

    phi = math.atan2(sin_phi, cos_phi)

    # Calculate theta3
    cos_theta3 = x / A
    sin_theta3 = -z / A
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Set theta1 to 0, calculate theta2
    theta1 = 0.0
    theta2 = phi - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the target coordinates, assuming the target is within the reachable workspace.
