To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow a systematic approach using the provided details and existing solutions as a foundation. Here's how we can extend the solution:

1. **Define the Transformation Matrices:**
   - For each joint, define the transformation matrix that represents the rotation and translation. Use homogeneous coordinates for simplicity.

2. **Compute the Forward Kinematics:**
   - Multiply the transformation matrices to get the end-effector's position and orientation in terms of the joint angles.

3. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Equate the computed position and orientation from the forward kinematics to the desired position `p` and orientation `r`.

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Use SymPy to solve the system of equations for the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Solves for the joint angles θ1, θ2, θ3 to reach the desired position p and orientation r.
    :param p: The desired position [x, y, z].
    :param r: The desired orientation [roll, pitch, yaw] in radians.
    :return: A tuple of joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3).

This implementation defines the transformation matrices for each joint, computes the total transformation, and sets up equations to solve for the joint angles that achieve the desired pose. The solution uses SymPy to handle the symbolic mathematics and solve the system of equations. The `extract_orientation` function converts the rotation matrix to Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) for comparison with the desired orientation.

You can call this function with a desired position and orientation to get the corresponding joint angles.
