To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Model Each Joint's Transformation**: Represent each revolute joint using transformation matrices that include both rotation and translation.

2. **Construct the Total Transformation**: Multiply the individual transformation matrices to get the total transformation from the base to the TCP.

3. **Set Up the Desired Transformation**: Construct the desired transformation matrix from the given position and orientation.

4. **Equate and Solve for Joint Angles**: Set the total transformation equal to the desired transformation and solve the resulting system of equations for the joint angles using SymPy.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation
import sympy as sp

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:

This function uses SymPy to symbolically solve the system of equations derived from equating the total transformation matrix to the desired transformation matrix. The solution provides the joint angles needed to reach the desired TCP pose.
