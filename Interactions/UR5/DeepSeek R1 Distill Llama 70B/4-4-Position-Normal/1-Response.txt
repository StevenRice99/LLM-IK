To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired coordinates [x, y, z]. 

Given the setup:
- The revolute joint rotates around the Z-axis.
- The TCP is positioned at [0, 0, 0.09465] in the local frame of the revolute joint.

The forward kinematics equations are:
- x = 0.09465 * cosθ
- y = 0.09465 * sinθ
- z = 0.09465

To find θ, we use the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant:

θ = atan2(y, x)

Here's the implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of y and x
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return theta
```
