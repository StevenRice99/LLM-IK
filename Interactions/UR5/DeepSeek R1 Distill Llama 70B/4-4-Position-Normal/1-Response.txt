To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the given 1 degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle required to position the TCP at a specified target position. The manipulator consists of a revolute joint rotating around the Z-axis, with the TCP located at a fixed height along the Z-axis. The solution involves calculating the joint angle using the arctangent function based on the target's XY coordinates.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Kinematics:**
   - The revolute joint rotates around the Z-axis, allowing movement in the XY-plane.
   - The TCP is positioned at a fixed height (Z = 0.09465 meters) above the joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - Given a joint angle θ, the TCP's position in the XY-plane is determined by:
     - \( x = 0.09465 \times \sin(\theta) \)
     - \( y = 0.09465 \times \cos(\theta) \)
   - The Z-coordinate remains constant at 0.09465 meters.

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Given a target position \( p = [x, y, z] \), we need to find the joint angle θ.
   - Since the Z-coordinate is fixed and the problem assumes reachability, we focus on the XY coordinates.
   - Using the arctangent function, the joint angle θ can be found as:
     - \( \theta = \arctan2(x, y) \)
   - This function correctly handles the quadrant, ensuring the angle is appropriate for the target position.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of x and y
    theta = math.atan2(x, y)
    return theta
```
