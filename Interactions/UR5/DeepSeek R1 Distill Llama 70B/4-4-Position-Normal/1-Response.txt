To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the given 1 degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired coordinates [x, y, z]. The TCP's movement is constrained to a circular path in the XY-plane with a fixed Z-coordinate of 0.09465 meters. The joint angle θ is calculated using the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant based on the signs of x and y.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctan2 to handle the correct quadrant
    theta = math.atan2(x, y)
    return theta
```
