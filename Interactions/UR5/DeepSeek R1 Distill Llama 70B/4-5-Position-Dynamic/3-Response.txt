To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that position the TCP at the desired target position p. The solution involves deriving the joint angles using trigonometric identities and solving a system of equations.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (theta1) rotates around the Z-axis, and the second joint (theta2) rotates around the Y-axis. The TCP is located at the end of the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations**: 
   - The position of the TCP in the world frame is given by:
     ```
     x = A * sin(theta1) + B * sin(theta1 + theta2)
     y = -A * cos(theta1) - B * cos(theta1 + theta2)
     z = A + B * cos(theta2)
     ```
     where A = 0.09465 meters and B = 0.0823 meters.

3. **Derive Inverse Kinematics**:
   - From the target position (px, py, pz), we know pz must be A + B * cos(theta2), so we focus on px and py.
   - Using trigonometric identities and solving the system of equations, we express theta1 and theta2 in terms of px and py.

4. **Implementation**:
   - Compute intermediate values to simplify the equations.
   - Use the arccos function to find the combined angle theta1 + phi.
   - Calculate theta1 and then theta2 using the derived equations.

Here is the Python function implementing the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    A = 0.09465  # Length of the first link
    B = 0.0823   # Length of the second link

    # Calculate the distance from the target to the origin
    distance = math.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)

    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (px**2 + py**2 - A**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * B)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, -py) - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles theta1 and theta2 to position the TCP at the desired target position p, considering the geometric constraints of the robot arm.
