To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-degree-of-freedom robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that position the TCP at the desired target position p. The solution involves deriving the joint angles using trigonometric identities and solving a system of equations.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Understand the Robot Geometry**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint (theta1) rotates around the Z-axis, and the second joint (theta2) rotates around the Y-axis. The TCP is located at the end of the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations**: 
   - The position of the TCP in the world frame is given by:
     ```
     x = 0.0823 * sin(theta2 - theta1)
     y = 0.0823 * cos(theta2 - theta1)
     z = 0.09465
     ```
     where 0.0823 meters is the length of the second link.

3. **Derive Inverse Kinematics**:
   - From the target position (px, py, pz), we know pz must be 0.09465, so we focus on px and py.
   - Calculate the angle phi as the direction to the target position:
     ```
     phi = atan2(px, py)
     ```
   - Set theta1 to phi to align the first joint with the target direction.
   - Calculate theta2 based on the distance from the origin to the target position:
     ```
     distance = sqrt(px^2 + py^2)
     theta2 = acos(distance / 0.0823)
     ```

4. **Implementation**:
   - Compute the angle phi using the arctangent function.
   - Set theta1 to phi.
   - Calculate theta2 using the arccosine function.

Here is the Python function implementing the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    link_length = 0.0823  # Length of the second link

    # Calculate the angle phi as the direction to the target position
    phi = math.atan2(px, py)

    # Set theta1 to phi to align the first joint with the target direction
    theta1 = phi

    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target position
    distance = math.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)

    # Calculate theta2 based on the distance and the second link's length
    theta2 = math.acos(distance / link_length)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles theta1 and theta2 to position the TCP at the desired target position p, considering the geometric constraints of the robot arm.
