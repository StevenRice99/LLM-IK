To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ (theta) and φ (phi) that position the TCP at the target coordinates (x, y, z). The solution involves calculating φ from the z-coordinate and then adjusting the x and y coordinates to find θ.

### Approach
1. **Calculate φ (phi):** Using the z-coordinate, we determine φ by solving the equation derived from the z-component of the TCP's position.
2. **Adjust x and y:** Subtract the contributions of the second joint's rotation from the target x and y coordinates to isolate the first joint's contribution.
3. **Calculate θ (theta):** Use the adjusted x and y coordinates to find θ using the arctangent function.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    A = 0.09465  # Length of the second link
    B = 0.0823   # Offset of the TCP along the second link

    # Calculate phi from the z-coordinate
    cos_phi = (z - A) / B
    phi = math.acos(cos_phi)
    sin_phi = math.sqrt(1 - cos_phi ** 2)

    # Adjust x and y by subtracting the contributions from the second joint
    adjusted_x = x - B * sin_phi
    adjusted_y = y - B * cos_phi

    # Calculate theta using the adjusted coordinates
    theta = math.atan2(adjusted_y, adjusted_x)

    return (theta, phi)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate φ:** The z-coordinate of the TCP is used to find φ using the arccosine function, as the TCP's z-position is directly related to φ.
2. **Adjust x and y:** The contributions of the second joint's rotation to the x and y coordinates are subtracted to isolate the first joint's effect.
3. **Calculate θ:** The arctangent of the adjusted y and x coordinates gives θ, which is the angle for the first joint.

This approach ensures that both joints contribute correctly to reaching the target position, considering their respective rotations and offsets.
