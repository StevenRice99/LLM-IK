To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates (px, py, pz). The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Compute θ2**: Using the z-coordinate of the target position, we calculate θ2 using the arccosine function.
2. **Compute sinθ2**: Using the value of θ2, we find sinθ2.
3. **Compute C**: This is the product of the link length and sinθ2.
4. **Compute θ1**: Using the x and y coordinates, we calculate θ1 using the arctangent function, considering the signs to determine the correct quadrant.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    :param p: The target position (x, y, z) for the TCP.
    :return: A tuple of two floats representing the joint angles θ1 and θ2 in radians.
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    A = 0.0823  # Offset from Joint 2 to TCP along Y
    B = 0.09465  # Length of Link 1 along Z

    # Calculate θ2 using the z-coordinate
    if B == 0:
        theta2 = 0.0
    else:
        cos_theta2 = pz / B
        # Clamp the value to the valid range for arccos
        cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
        theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate sin(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    C = B * sin_theta2

    # Calculate θ1 using the x and y coordinates
    numerator = A * py + C * px
    denominator = C * py + A * px

    if denominator == 0:
        if numerator == 0:
            theta1 = 0.0
        else:
            # Determine the sign based on the numerator
            theta1 = math.pi / 2 if numerator > 0 else -math.pi / 2
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan2(numerator, denominator)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, considering the geometric constraints of the manipulator.
