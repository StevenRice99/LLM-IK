To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates [x_d, y_d, z_d]. The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Compute θ2** using the z-component of the target position.
2. **Compute θ1** using the x and y components of the target position.

Here is the Python function implementing the solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the desired TCP position [x, y, z].
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of two floats representing the joint angles θ1 and θ2 in radians.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    C = 0.0823  # Offset of the TCP along Y in the second joint's frame
    B = 0.09465  # Offset of the second joint along Z in the first joint's frame

    # Calculate theta2 using the z-component
    sin_theta2 = (B - z_d) / C
    # Clamp sin_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    sin_theta2 = max(min(sin_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)

    # Calculate theta1 using the arctangent of y_d and x_d
    if x_d == 0 and y_d == 0:
        theta1 = 0.0
    else:
        theta1 = math.atan2(y_d, x_d)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function first calculates θ2 based on the z-component of the target position. It then calculates θ1 using the arctangent of the x and y components. The solution assumes the target is reachable, as specified in the problem statement.
