To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles theta1 and theta2 that position the TCP at a specified location. The approach involves deriving the forward kinematics equations and then inverting them to find the joint angles.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. Joint1 rotates around the Z-axis, and Joint2 rotates around the Y-axis. The TCP is located at a fixed position relative to Joint2.
2. **Forward Kinematics**: Derive the position of the TCP in terms of the joint angles theta1 and theta2.
3. **Inverse Kinematics**: Solve the derived equations for theta1 and theta2 given the desired TCP position.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the z-component
    sin_theta2 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.0823
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the x and y components
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate theta2**: Using the z-component of the TCP position, we solve for theta2 using the arcsin function. This gives us the angle needed around the Y-axis to reach the desired height.
2. **Calculate theta1**: Using the x and y components, we solve for theta1 using the arctangent function, which gives the angle needed around the Z-axis to position the TCP correctly in the X-Y plane.

This approach efficiently computes the required joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, considering the robot's structure and movement constraints.
