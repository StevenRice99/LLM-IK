To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF robotic arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at a desired location. The robot's structure and the forward kinematics equations provide the foundation for deriving the inverse kinematics solution.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis, and Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis. The TCP is attached to Joint 2 with a fixed offset.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations**: Using rotation matrices, express the TCP's position in terms of θ1 and θ2. This involves calculating the position of Joint 2 relative to the base and then adding the TCP's offset.

3. **Inverse Kinematics Goal**: Given a desired TCP position (x, y, z), solve for θ1 and θ2 such that the TCP reaches the desired position.

4. **Simplify the Problem**: Since the TCP's z-coordinate is fixed at 0.09465 m, focus on solving for x and y. Use trigonometric identities and the law of cosines to relate the joint angles to the desired position.

5. **Closed-Form Solution**: Derive equations that express θ1 and θ2 in terms of x and y, ensuring the solution is analytical and avoids numerical methods.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Given constants
    a = 0.09465  # length from base to joint 2
    b = 0.0823   # length from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the XY-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Check if the target is within reach
    if r > a + b or r < abs(a - b):
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach")
    
    # Calculate the angle alpha from the x-axis to the TCP
    alpha = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the law of cosines
    theta1 = alpha + math.acos((a**2 + r**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * r))
    theta2 = alpha + math.acos((a**2 + b**2 - r**2) / (2 * a * b))
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Distance Calculation**: Compute the distance `r` from the base to the TCP in the XY-plane using the Pythagorean theorem.

2. **Reachability Check**: Ensure the target position is within the robot's reachable range, which is between |a - b| and a + b.

3. **Angle Calculation**: Determine the angle `alpha` from the X-axis to the TCP using `atan2(y, x)`.

4. **Law of Cosines**: Use the law of cosines to solve for θ1 and θ2. This involves calculating the angles based on the distances and the known link lengths.

This approach provides a closed-form analytical solution to the inverse kinematics problem, allowing the robot to reach the desired TCP position efficiently.
