To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at a specified location (x, y, z). The approach involves deriving the forward kinematics equations and then inverting them to solve for the joint angles.

### Approach
1. **Solve for θ2 using the z-coordinate**:
   - Use the equation \( z = -0.09465 \cos\theta_2 \).
   - Calculate \( \cos\theta_2 = -\frac{z}{0.09465} \).
   - Find \( \sin\theta_2 = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\theta_2} \).

2. **Solve for θ1 using the x and y coordinates**:
   - Calculate intermediate variables \( A \) and \( B \) from the x and y coordinates.
   - Use these to find \( \sin\theta_1 \) and \( \cos\theta_1 \).
   - Use the arctangent function to determine θ1.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta2 using the z-coordinate
    cos_theta2 = -z / 0.09465
    if abs(cos_theta2) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    theta2 = math.asin(-z / 0.09465)  # Using arcsin to find theta2

    # Calculate intermediate variables A and B
    A = (y - x) / (2 * 0.0823)
    B = (x + y) / (2 * 0.0823)

    # Solve for sin(theta1) and cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = A
    cos_theta1 = B / sin_theta2

    # Ensure cos_theta1 is within valid range
    if abs(cos_theta1) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")

    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Solving for θ2**:
   - The z-coordinate equation is used to find \( \cos\theta_2 \).
   - \( \sin\theta_2 \) is derived using the Pythagorean identity.
   - θ2 is found using the arcsin function.

2. **Solving for θ1**:
   - Intermediate variables A and B are calculated from the x and y coordinates.
   - These variables are used to find \( \sin\theta_1 \) and \( \cos\theta_1 \).
   - θ1 is determined using the arctangent function, ensuring the correct quadrant is considered.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem, providing the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location.
