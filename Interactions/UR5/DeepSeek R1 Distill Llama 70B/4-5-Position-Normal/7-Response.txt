To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired coordinates [x_d, y_d, z_d]. Given the structure of the manipulator, the TCP's z-coordinate is fixed at 0.09465, meaning the TCP can only move in the x-y plane within a circle of radius 0.0823 centered at [0, 0, 0.09465]. 

### Approach
1. **Check Reachability**: Verify if the target position lies on the circle defined by the TCP's reachable workspace in the x-y plane.
2. **Compute θ1**: Use the arctangent function to determine θ1 based on the x and y components of the target position.
3. **Set θ2**: Since θ2 does not affect the x-y position of the TCP, it can be set to 0 or any other value within its limits.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the desired TCP position [x, y, z].
    
    Returns:
        A tuple of two floats representing the joint angles θ1 and θ2 in radians.
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    radius = 0.0823  # Radius of the circle in the x-y plane
    
    # Check if the target is within the reachable workspace
    if not (abs(x_d) < radius * 2 and abs(y_d) < radius * 2):
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach.")
    
    # Calculate theta1 using arctangent of y and x
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x_d, y_d)
    
    # Theta2 can be set to 0 as it doesn't affect the x-y position
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
- **Reachability Check**: The function first checks if the target position is within the manipulator's reachable workspace in the x-y plane.
- **θ1 Calculation**: Using `math.atan2(-x_d, y_d)`, the function computes the angle θ1, which adjusts the TCP's position in the x-y plane.
- **θ2 Setting**: Since θ2 does not affect the x-y position, it is set to 0, ensuring the TCP remains at the fixed z-coordinate of 0.09465.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by focusing on the essential degrees of freedom needed to reach the target position.
