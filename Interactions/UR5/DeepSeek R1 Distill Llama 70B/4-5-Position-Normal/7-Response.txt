To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that will position the TCP at the desired coordinates (px, py, pz). Based on the analysis, here's the corrected approach:

1. **Compute θ2**: Since the z-coordinate of the TCP is fixed at 0.09465, θ2 is always 0.
2. **Compute θ1**: Using the x and y coordinates of the target position, θ1 is calculated using the arctangent function, considering the correct signs to determine the appropriate quadrant.

Here is the corrected Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the given position p.
    
    :param p: The target position (x, y, z) for the TCP.
    :return: A tuple of two floats representing the joint angles θ1 and θ2 in radians.
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    A = 0.0823  # Offset from Joint 2 to TCP along Y

    # Since pz must be 0.09465, theta2 is always 0
    theta2 = 0.0

    # Calculate theta1 using the corrected arctangent
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, py)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function correctly calculates the joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates by adjusting the calculation of θ1 to account for the correct quadrant and sign.
