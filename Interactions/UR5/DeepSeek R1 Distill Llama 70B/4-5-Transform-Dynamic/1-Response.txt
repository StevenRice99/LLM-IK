To solve the inverse kinematicsfor the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Adjust the Target Position**: Subtract the TCP's offset from the target position to find where the second link should be.
2. **Calculate Joint 2 Angle**: Use the adjusted X and Z coordinates to find the angle for the second joint using `atan2(x, z)`.
3. **Calculate Joint 1 Angle**: Use the adjusted X and Y coordinates to find the angle for the first joint using `atan2(y, x)`.

Here's the completed code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Adjust the target position for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = [0, 0.0823, 0]
    adjusted_p = (p[0] - tcp_offset[0], p[1] - tcp_offset[1], p[2] - tcp_offset[2])
    
    # Calculate joint 2 based on adjusted x and z
    x, y, z = adjusted_p
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 based on adjusted x and y
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution accounts for the TCP offset and calculates each joint angle based on the adjusted target position, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired location.
