To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate θ2**: Use the z-component of the target position to solve for θ2 using the arccosine function.
2. **Calculate θ1**: Use the x and y components of the target position to solve for θ1 using the arctangent function.

Here's the completed code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the z-component
    link2_length = 0.09465
    tcp_offset = 0.0823
    cos_theta2 = (z_target - link2_length) / tcp_offset
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the x and y components
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y_target, x_target)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution calculates the joint angles based on the target position, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired location.
