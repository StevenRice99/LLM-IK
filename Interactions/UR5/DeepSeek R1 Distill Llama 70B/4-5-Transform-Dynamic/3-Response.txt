To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Adjust the Target Position**: Subtract the TCP's offset from the target position to find the position the second link should reach.
2. **Calculate θ2**: Use the adjusted z-component of the target position to solve for θ2.
3. **Calculate θ1**: Use the adjusted x and y components of the target position to solve for θ1, considering the orientation.

Here's the completed code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Adjust the target position for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = [0, 0.0823, 0]
    adjusted_p = (p[0] - tcp_offset[0], p[1] - tcp_offset[1], p[2] - tcp_offset[2])
    
    # Calculate joint 2 based on the adjusted z position
    x, y, z = adjusted_p
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.09465)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 based on the adjusted x and y positions
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution adjusts the target position to account for the TCP's offset and calculates the joint angles based on the adjusted position, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired location and orientation.
