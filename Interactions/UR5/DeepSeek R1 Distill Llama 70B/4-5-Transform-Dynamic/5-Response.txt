To resolve the "math domainerror" and improve the inverse kinematics solution, we'll modify the approach to use `atan2` for both joint calculations, ensuring robustness and avoiding domain issues.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Adjust the Target Position**: Subtract the TCP's offset from the target position to find where the second link should be.
2. **Calculate Joint 2 Angle (θ2)**: Use the adjusted z-component and the link length to find θ2 using `atan2`.
3. **Calculate Joint 1 Angle (θ1)**: Use the adjusted x and y components to find θ1 using `atan2`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Adjust the target position for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = [0, 0.0823, 0]
    adjusted_p = (p[0] - tcp_offset[0], p[1] - tcp_offset[1], p[2] - tcp_offset[2])
    
    # Calculate joint 2 based on the adjusted z position and link length
    x, y, z = adjusted_p
    link_length = 0.09465
    theta2 = math.atan2(z, link_length)
    
    # Calculate joint 1 based on the adjusted x and y positions
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution uses `atan2` to calculate both joint angles, ensuring that the calculations remain within valid domains and providing accurate joint angles for the desired target position and orientation.
