To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Extract Position Components**: Separate the desired position into x, y, and z components.

2. **Compute Theta2**: Calculate the second joint angle using the z-component of the position, as it directly relates to the height of the TCP.

3. **Set Up Equations**: Formulate the system of equations for the x and y components, considering the contributions from both joints.

4. **Solve the System**: Use matrix operations to solve for the intermediate angle phi, which combines the effects of both joints.

5. **Determine Theta1**: Calculate the first joint angle using the computed value of phi and the previously determined theta2.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p

    # Calculate theta2 from the z-component of the position
    theta2 = math.asin(pz / 0.0823)

    # Define the lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.09465
    l2 = 0.0823

    # Compute coefficients for the equations
    A1 = l1 * math.cos(theta2)
    B1 = -l1 * math.sin(theta2) + l2
    A2 = l1 * math.cos(theta2) + l2
    B2 = l1 * math.sin(theta2)

    # Calculate the determinant
    det = A1 * B2 - A2 * B1

    # Solve for sin(phi) and cos(phi)
    sin_phi = (B2 * px - A2 * py) / det
    cos_phi = (A1 * py - B1 * px) / det

    # Ensure sin^2 + cos^2 = 1 (for validity)
    # Since the problem states the target is reachable, we proceed

    # Calculate phi
    phi = math.atan2(sin_phi, cos_phi)

    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = phi - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired location, considering both the position and orientation constraints.
