To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we first determine the joint angles that achieve the desired TCP position and orientation. The position equations are derived from the geometry of the robot, and the orientation is matched by equating the rotation matrices.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Position Equations:**
   - The TCP's position in the global frame is determined by the joint angles q1 and q2.
   - From the geometry, the TCP's position is:
     ```
     x = -0.0823 * sin(q1)
     y = 0.0823 * cos(q1)
     z = 0.09465
     ```
   - Solving for q1 using the arctangent of the desired x and y positions:
     ```
     q1 = arctan2(-x_desired, y_desired)
     ```

2. **Orientation Equations:**
   - The TCP's orientation is a combination of rotations from both joints.
   - The rotation matrix for the TCP is derived from the joint angles q1 and q2.
   - By comparing the desired orientation (given as Euler angles) with the derived rotation matrix, we determine q2 as the pitch angle from the desired Euler angles.

**Solution Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Calculate q1 from the position
    q1 = math.atan2(-p[0], p[1])
    
    # Calculate q2 from the orientation's pitch angle (assuming r[1] is the pitch)
    q2 = r[1]
    
    return (q1, q2)
```

This solution assumes that the pitch angle from the desired Euler angles directly corresponds to the second joint angle q2. The first joint angle q1 is determined from the arctangent of the desired x and y positions, ensuring the TCP reaches the correct position while matching the orientation through the pitch angle.
