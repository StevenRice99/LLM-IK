To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF robot arm, we need to determine the joint angles θ1 and θ2 that position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. The solution involves using the geometric relationships and the given constraints.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Robot Structure**: The robot has two revolute joints. The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, and the second around the Y-axis. The TCP is fixed relative to the second joint.
2. **Position Equations**: Using trigonometric relationships, express the TCP's position in terms of the joint angles.
3. **Orientation Analysis**: The orientation of the TCP is determined by the joint angles. The roll is fixed at 0, the pitch is determined by θ2, and the yaw by θ1.
4. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - Compute θ2 using the y-component of the desired position.
   - Use the x and z components to solve for θ1, ensuring the solution satisfies both position and orientation requirements.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Calculate theta2 from the y-component of the position
    theta2 = math.asin(py / 0.0823)
    cos_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - (py / 0.0823) ** 2)

    # Calculate theta1 from the x and z components
    numerator = pz - 0.09465
    denominator = 0.0823 * cos_theta2
    if denominator == 0:
        raise ValueError("Denominator is zero, which is not possible as per problem constraints.")
    
    theta1 = math.atan2(numerator, px / denominator)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - The y-component of the TCP's position is used to find θ2 using the inverse sine function.
   - The x and z components are used to find θ1 using the arctangent function, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.
2. **Orientation Matching**:
   - The orientation is achieved by setting θ1 to match the desired yaw angle and θ2 to match the desired pitch angle, with roll fixed at 0.

This approach efficiently solves the inverse kinematics problem by leveraging geometric relationships and trigonometric functions, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired pose.
