To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location and orientation. Here's a detailed approach:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understand the Robot Structure:**
   - **Joint 1:** Revolute joint rotating around the Z-axis.
   - **Joint 2:** Revolute joint rotating around the Y-axis.
   - **TCP:** Located at [0, 0.0823, 0] relative to Joint 2.

2. **Forward Kinematics Equations:**
   - **Position:**
     ```
     x = -0.0823 * sin(q1)
     y = 0.0823 * cos(q1)
     z = 0.09465
     ```
   - **Orientation:**
     The orientation is determined by the combined rotations of Joint 1 and Joint 2.

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - **Position:**
     Solve for q1 using the arctangent of the desired x and y positions.
     ```
     q1 = arctan2(-x_desired, y_desired)
     ```
   - **Orientation:**
     Match the desired orientation by solving for q2 based on the pitch angle from the Euler angles.

4. **Implementation:**
   - Use the derived equations to compute q1 and q2 in the inverse_kinematics function.

### Solution Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Calculate q1 from the position
    q1 = math.atan2(-p[0], p[1])
    
    # Calculate q2 from the orientation's pitch angle (assuming r[1] is the pitch)
    q2 = r[1]
    
    return (q1, q2)
```

This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation by accurately calculating the necessary joint angles based on the robot's structure and the given target pose.
