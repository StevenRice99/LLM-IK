To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired target position p. The manipulator's joint rotates around the Y-axis, and the TCP's movement is constrained to the X-Z plane.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Kinematics**: The TCP's position changes as the joint rotates. Given the TCP's initial position and the rotation around the Y-axis, we derive the equations for the TCP's position in terms of the joint angle θ.
2. **Formulating the Equations**: Using trigonometric identities, we express the TCP's X and Z coordinates as functions of θ. By solving these equations, we can find θ for a given target position.
3. **Using Arctangent Function**: The joint angle θ can be efficiently found using the `math.atan2` function, which correctly handles the quadrant based on the signs of the coordinates.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of z/x, considering the correct quadrant
    theta = math.atan2(-z, x)
    return theta
```

### Explanation
- **Problem Analysis**: The TCP's movement is constrained to the X-Z plane due to the joint's rotation around the Y-axis. The goal is to find the angle θ that aligns the TCP with the target position.
- **Kinematic Equations**: The TCP's X and Z coordinates are expressed as `x = 0.0823 * cosθ` and `z = -0.0823 * sinθ`. Solving these gives the joint angle θ.
- **Arctangent Calculation**: Using `math.atan2(-z, x)` correctly determines θ in the appropriate quadrant, ensuring accurate results for all reachable target positions.

This approach efficiently computes the required joint angle using basic trigonometric functions and handles all edge cases within the joint's operational limits.
