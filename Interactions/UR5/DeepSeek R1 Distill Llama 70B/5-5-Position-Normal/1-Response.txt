To determine the joint angleθ needed to reach a target position p = [x, y, z], we can use the inverse kinematics approach. Given that the TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane with a radius of 0.0823 meters, the relationship between the target coordinates and the joint angle can be derived using trigonometric functions.

1. **Understand the Movement**: The TCP moves in a circle of radius 0.0823 meters in the X-Z plane. The Y-coordinate of the target position must be 0.0823 meters, as the TCP's Y position is fixed.

2. **Relate Target Position to Joint Angle**: The joint angle θ can be found using the arctangent function, considering the correct quadrant. This is done by calculating θ as the arctangent of the X-coordinate divided by the Z-coordinate.

3. **Calculate θ**: Using the `math.atan2` function, which considers the signs of both x and z to determine the correct quadrant, we can compute θ as follows:
   \[
   \theta = \text{atan2}(x, z)
   \]

4. **Return θ**: The computed angle θ is the value to set the joint to, allowing the TCP to reach the desired position p.

Here is the Python function implementing this solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Since the movement is in the X-Z plane, we use x and z to compute the angle
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)
    return theta
```

This function calculates the necessary joint angle θ using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates of the target position, ensuring the correct quadrant is considered.
