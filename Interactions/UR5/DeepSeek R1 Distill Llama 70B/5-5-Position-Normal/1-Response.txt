To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle Î¸ that positions the TCP at the desired coordinates. The TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane with a radius equal to the distance from the joint to the TCP, which is 0.0823 meters. Using the arctangent function with two arguments allows us to correctly determine the angle in the appropriate quadrant.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of x and z
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)
    return theta
```
