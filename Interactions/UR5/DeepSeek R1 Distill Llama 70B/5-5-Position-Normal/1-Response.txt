To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle required to position the TCP at a specified target position. The manipulator's TCP moves in a circular path in the X-Z plane, with its Y-coordinate fixed. The solution involves calculating the joint angle using the arctangent function, considering the geometric constraints.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Kinematics:**
   - The revolute joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is positioned at (0, 0.0823, 0) in the local frame, meaning it's offset along the Y-axis by 0.0823 meters.
   - As the joint rotates by an angle θ, the TCP moves in a circle in the X-Z plane with radius 0.0823 meters.

2. **Express TCP Position in World Coordinates:**
   - When the joint rotates by θ, the TCP's world coordinates become:
     - \( x = 0.0823 \cdot \sin(\theta) \)
     - \( y = 0.0823 \) (fixed)
     - \( z = 0.0823 \cdot \cos(\theta) \)

3. **Formulate the Inverse Kinematics Problem:**
   - Given a target position \( p = (x, y, z) \), we need to find θ such that:
     - \( x = 0.0823 \cdot \sin(\theta) \)
     - \( z = 0.0823 \cdot \cos(\theta) \)
   - Since \( y \) must be 0.0823 for the target to be reachable, we focus on \( x \) and \( z \).

4. **Solve for θ:**
   - Using the arctangent function to find θ:
     - \( \theta = \arctan2(x, z) \)
   - The arctangent of \( x \) and \( z \) gives the angle in the correct quadrant.

5. **Implement the Solution in Code:**
   - Extract \( x \) and \( z \) from the target position \( p \).
   - Compute θ using the `math.atan2` function to handle all quadrants correctly.

**Final Code:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent of x and z
    theta = math.atan2(x, z)
    return theta
```
