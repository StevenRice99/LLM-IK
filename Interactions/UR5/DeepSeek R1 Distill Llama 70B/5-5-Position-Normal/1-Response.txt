To solve the inverse kinematicsproblem for the given 1-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle θ that positions the TCP at the desired target position p. The TCP moves in a circular path around the Y-axis, and its position in the global frame is determined by the joint angle θ. Using trigonometric relationships, we can derive θ from the target coordinates.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Kinematics:**
   - The revolute joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The TCP's local position is [0, 0.0823, 0], meaning it's offset along the Y-axis.
   - As the joint rotates by θ, the TCP moves in the X-Y plane.

2. **Model the TCP Position:**
   - The global position of the TCP after rotation by θ is given by:
     - x = 0.0823 * sin(θ)
     - y = 0.0823 * cos(θ)
     - z = 0 (since movement is constrained to the X-Y plane)

3. **Relate Target Position to Joint Angle:**
   - Given a target position p = [x, y, z], we know z must be 0 (or ignored as the problem states all targets are reachable).
   - Using trigonometric identities:
     - sin(θ) = x / 0.0823
     - cos(θ) = y / 0.0823
   - Therefore, θ can be found using the arctangent function considering the correct quadrant: θ = arctan2(x, y).

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Extract x and y from the target position.
   - Compute θ using math.atan2(x, y) to handle all quadrants correctly.

**Code Implementation:**

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctangent in the correct quadrant
    theta = math.atan2(x, y)
    return theta
```

This function computes the necessary joint angle θ to position the TCP at the desired target position p, considering the constraints and movement of the 1-DOF manipulator.
