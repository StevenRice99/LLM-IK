To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1 and theta2) for a 2-DOF serial manipulator such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves considering both the position and orientation constraints provided by the target, ensuring that the computed joint angles satisfy both.

### Approach
1. **Position Analysis**: The z-coordinate of the target position is used to compute theta2. This is derived from the geometric relationship involving the length of the link and the z-coordinate.
2. **Orientation Analysis**: The target orientation (given as roll, pitch, yaw angles) is converted into a rotation matrix. From this matrix, theta1 is derived using elements corresponding to the Z-axis rotation.
3. **Position Verification**: The computed theta1 and theta2 are used to verify the x and y coordinates of the target position. If they do not match, theta1 is adjusted by π to account for the periodic nature of the arctangent function.

### Solution Code
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def euler_to_matrix(roll, pitch, yaw):
    Rz = np.array([
        [math.cos(yaw), -math.sin(yaw), 0],
        [math.sin(yaw), math.cos(yaw), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    Ry = np.array([
        [math.cos(pitch), 0, math.sin(pitch)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(pitch), 0, math.cos(pitch)]
    ])
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, math.cos(roll), -math.sin(roll)],
        [0, math.sin(roll), math.cos(roll)]
    ])
    return Rz @ Ry @ Rx

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    px, py, pz = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Compute theta2 from z-coordinate
    cos_theta2 = pz / 0.425
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_candidates = [theta2, -theta2]
    
    R_target = euler_to_matrix(roll, pitch, yaw)
    
    for theta2 in theta2_candidates:
        sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
        
        # Compute theta1 from orientation matrix elements
        theta1 = math.atan2(-R_target[0, 1], R_target[1, 1])
        
        # Calculate expected x and y using forward kinematics
        A = 0.425 * sin_theta2
        B = -0.01615
        x_calculated = A * math.cos(theta1) + B * math.sin(theta1)
        y_calculated = B * math.cos(theta1) + A * math.sin(theta1)
        
        if math.isclose(x_calculated, px, abs_tol=1e-6) and math.isclose(y_calculated, py, abs_tol=1e-6):
            return (theta1, theta2)
        
        # Check theta1 + pi
        theta1_alt = theta1 + math.pi
        x_alt = A * math.cos(theta1_alt) + B * math.sin(theta1_alt)
        y_alt = B * math.cos(theta1_alt) + A * math.sin(theta1_alt)
        
        if math.isclose(x_alt, px, abs_tol=1e-6) and math.isclose(y_alt, py, abs_tol=1e-6):
            theta1_alt = (theta1_alt + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
            return (theta1_alt, theta2)
    
    raise ValueError("No valid solution found")
```

### Explanation
1. **Position Analysis**: The z-coordinate of the target position is used to compute theta2 using the inverse cosine function. This gives two possible solutions for theta2 (positive and negative).
2. **Orientation Analysis**: The target orientation is converted into a rotation matrix. Theta1 is derived from elements of this matrix that correspond to the Z-axis rotation.
3. **Position Verification**: For each candidate theta2, the corresponding theta1 is used to compute the expected x and y coordinates. If these match the target coordinates, the solution is returned. If not, theta1 is adjusted by π and checked again to ensure the correct solution is found.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation constraints are satisfied, providing the correct joint angles for the manipulator to reach the target.
