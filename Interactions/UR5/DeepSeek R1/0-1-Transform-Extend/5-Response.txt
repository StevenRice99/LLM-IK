To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to correctly derive the joint angles (θ₁, θ₂) from the target position and orientation. The previous errors stemmed from incorrect coefficients in the position equations. By correcting these coefficients and ensuring the proper signs, we can accurately compute the joint angles.

### Approach
1. **Rotation Matrix Calculation**: Convert the target Euler angles to a rotation matrix using the ZYX convention.
2. **θ₂ Calculation**: Extract θ₂ from the rotation matrix elements corresponding to the Y-axis rotation.
3. **Position Equations**: Correctly derive the coefficients for the position equations based on the manipulator's link lengths.
4. **θ₁ Calculation**: Solve the system of linear equations using the corrected coefficients to determine θ₁.

### Solution Code
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def euler_to_matrix(rx, ry, rz):
    """Converts Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) to a rotation matrix using ZYX convention."""
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, math.cos(rx), -math.sin(rx)],
        [0, math.sin(rx), math.cos(rx)]
    ])
    Ry = np.array([
        [math.cos(ry), 0, math.sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(ry), 0, math.cos(ry)]
    ])
    Rz = np.array([
        [math.cos(rz), -math.sin(rz), 0],
        [math.sin(rz), math.cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    return Rz @ Ry @ Rx

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    R_target = euler_to_matrix(rx, ry, rz)
    r31 = R_target[2, 0]
    r33 = R_target[2, 2]
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(-r31, r33)
    
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615  # Corrected from -0.01615
    
    det = A**2 + B**2
    if abs(det) < 1e-6:
        raise ValueError("Determinant is zero, target is unreachable.")
    
    cos_theta1 = (A * px + B * py) / det
    sin_theta1 = (A * py - B * px) / det
    
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Rotation Matrix**: The `euler_to_matrix` function correctly converts Euler angles to a rotation matrix using the ZYX convention, ensuring proper orientation handling.
2. **θ₂ Calculation**: The second joint angle (θ₂) is derived from the elements of the target rotation matrix, ensuring alignment with the manipulator's Y-axis rotation.
3. **Position Equations**: The coefficients for the position equations are corrected to use the proper link lengths and signs, ensuring accurate calculation of θ₁.
4. **θ₁ Calculation**: The system of equations derived from the forward kinematics is solved using the corrected coefficients, leading to accurate joint angles that satisfy both position and orientation constraints.

This approach addresses the previous errors by ensuring the correct derivation of coefficients and proper handling of signs, resulting in accurate inverse kinematics solutions.
