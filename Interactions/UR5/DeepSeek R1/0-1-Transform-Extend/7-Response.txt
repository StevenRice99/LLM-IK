To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to correctly derive the joint angles (θ₁, θ₂) by accurately setting up the system of equations based on the manipulator's geometry and solving them with the correct coefficients.

### Approach
1. **Rotation Matrix Calculation**: Convert the target Euler angles to a rotation matrix using the ZYX convention.
2. **θ₂ Calculation**: Extract θ₂ from the rotation matrix elements corresponding to the Y-axis rotation.
3. **Position Equations**: Use the correct coefficients derived from the manipulator's link lengths and joint positions to set up the system of equations for θ₁.
4. **θ₁ Calculation**: Solve the system of linear equations using the correct determinant and coefficients to determine θ₁.

### Solution Code
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def euler_to_matrix(rx, ry, rz):
    """Converts Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) to a rotation matrix using ZYX convention."""
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, math.cos(rx), -math.sin(rx)],
        [0, math.sin(rx), math.cos(rx)]
    ])
    Ry = np.array([
        [math.cos(ry), 0, math.sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(ry), 0, math.cos(ry)]
    ])
    Rz = np.array([
        [math.cos(rz), -math.sin(rz), 0],
        [math.sin(rz), math.cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    return Rz @ Ry @ Rx

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    R_target = euler_to_matrix(rx, ry, rz)
    r31 = R_target[2, 0]
    r33 = R_target[2, 2]
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(-r31, r33)
    
    A = 0.25555  # 0.13585 + 0.1197
    B = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    C = B
    D = 0.01615  # 0.13585 - 0.1197
    
    det = A * D - B * C
    if abs(det) < 1e-6:
        raise ValueError("Determinant is zero, target is unreachable.")
    
    sin_theta1 = (D * px - B * py) / det
    cos_theta1 = (A * py - C * px) / det
    
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Rotation Matrix**: The `euler_to_matrix` function converts the target Euler angles into a rotation matrix using the ZYX convention, ensuring the correct orientation representation.
2. **θ₂ Calculation**: The second joint angle (θ₂) is derived from the elements of the target rotation matrix, specifically using the third row to align with the manipulator's Y-axis rotation.
3. **Position Equations**: The coefficients for the system of equations are correctly derived from the manipulator's link lengths (0.13585 and -0.1197), ensuring accurate representation of the position constraints.
4. **θ₁ Calculation**: The system of equations is solved using the correct determinant and coefficients, allowing for precise calculation of θ₁ through the arctangent function, which accounts for the correct quadrant.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation constraints are met by accurately modeling the manipulator's geometry and solving the resulting equations with the correct mathematical relationships.
