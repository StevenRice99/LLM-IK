To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1 and theta2) for a 2-DOF robotic arm such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves deriving these angles using both the position and orientation constraints provided.

### Approach
1. **Position Analysis**: The position of the TCP is determined by the joint angles theta1 and theta2. Using the given position (p), we can derive theta2 from the z-coordinate and then solve for theta1 using the x and y coordinates.
2. **Orientation Analysis**: The orientation of the TCP is derived from the joint rotations. The target orientation (given as RPY angles) must be compatible with the joint angles derived from the position analysis.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Calculate theta2 from the z-coordinate
    theta2 = np.arccos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Calculate A and B
    A = 0.425 * np.sin(theta2)
    B = -0.01615
    
    # Compute denominator
    denominator = A**2 - B**2
    if np.isclose(denominator, 0):
        denominator = 1e-6  # Avoid division by zero, though target is reachable
    
    # Compute cos(theta1) and sin(theta1)
    cos_theta1 = (A * x - B * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (A * y - B * x) / denominator
    
    # Compute theta1 using arctan2
    theta1 = np.arctan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Check the alternative solution for theta2 (pi - theta2)
    alt_theta2 = -theta2
    alt_A = 0.425 * np.sin(alt_theta2)
    alt_denominator = alt_A**2 - B**2
    if not np.isclose(alt_denominator, 0):
        alt_cos_theta1 = (alt_A * x - B * y) / alt_denominator
        alt_sin_theta1 = (alt_A * y - B * x) / alt_denominator
        alt_theta1 = np.arctan2(alt_sin_theta1, alt_cos_theta1)
        
        # Check which solution matches the orientation
        # Compute expected orientation from theta1 and theta2
        expected_roll = 0.0  # As per the problem's reachability constraints
        expected_pitch = theta2
        expected_yaw = theta1
        
        # Check if the alternative solution matches the orientation
        if np.isclose(expected_pitch % (2*np.pi), pitch % (2*np.pi)) and \
           np.isclose(expected_yaw % (2*np.pi), yaw % (2*np.pi)):
            return (theta1, theta2)
        else:
            # Check the alternative theta2 solution
            expected_pitch_alt = alt_theta2
            expected_yaw_alt = alt_theta1
            if np.isclose(expected_pitch_alt % (2*np.pi), pitch % (2*np.pi)) and \
               np.isclose(expected_yaw_alt % (2*np.pi), yaw % (2*np.pi)):
                return (alt_theta1, alt_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**: The z-coordinate of the target position directly gives theta2 using the inverse cosine function. The x and y coordinates are used to form a system of linear equations solved for theta1 using matrix inversion.
2. **Orientation Check**: After calculating potential solutions for theta1 and theta2, we check which solution matches the target orientation by comparing the derived angles with the given RPY values. This ensures that both position and orientation constraints are satisfied.

This approach efficiently combines position and orientation constraints to determine the correct joint angles, ensuring the robotic arm reaches the desired configuration.
