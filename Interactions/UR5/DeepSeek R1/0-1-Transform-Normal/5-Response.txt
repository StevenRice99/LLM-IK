To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1 and theta2) for a 2-DOF robotic arm such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves deriving these angles using both the position and orientation constraints provided.

### Approach
1. **Position Analysis**: The position of the TCP is determined by the joint angles theta1 and theta2. Using the given position (p), we can derive theta2 from the z-coordinate and then solve for theta1 using the x and y coordinates.
2. **Orientation Analysis**: The orientation of the TCP is derived from the joint rotations. The target orientation (given as RPY angles) must be compatible with the joint angles derived from the position analysis. We compute the rotation matrix from the target RPY angles and check if it matches the rotation matrix generated by the derived joint angles.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def rpy_to_matrix(roll, pitch, yaw):
    """Converts RPY angles to a rotation matrix using ZYX convention."""
    Rx = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, np.cos(roll), -np.sin(roll)],
        [0, np.sin(roll), np.cos(roll)]
    ])
    Ry = np.array([
        [np.cos(pitch), 0, np.sin(pitch)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-np.sin(pitch), 0, np.cos(pitch)]
    ])
    Rz = np.array([
        [np.cos(yaw), -np.sin(yaw), 0],
        [np.sin(yaw), np.cos(yaw), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    return Rz @ Ry @ Rx

    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    roll_target, pitch_target, yaw_target = r

    # Compute target rotation matrix from RPY
    R_target = rpy_to_matrix(roll_target, pitch_target, yaw_target)

    # Calculate possible theta2 values from z-coordinate
    z_ratio = z_target / 0.425
    z_ratio = np.clip(z_ratio, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure valid arccos input

    # Check both theta2 solutions
    for theta2 in [theta2_1, theta2_2]:
        A = 0.425 * np.sin(theta2)
        B = 0.01615
        denominator = A**2 + B**2

        if np.isclose(denominator, 0):
            continue  # Skip if no solution

        # Calculate theta1 from position equations
        cos_theta1 = (A * x_target + B * y_target) / denominator

        R_z = np.array([
            [np.cos(theta1), -np.sin(theta1), 0],
            [np.sin(theta1), np.cos(theta1), 0],

        ])

        R_robot = R_z @ R_y

        # Check if rotation matrices match
        if np.allclose(R_robot, R_target, atol=1e-6):
            return (theta1, theta2)

    # Fallback to first theta2 solution (shouldn't reach here for valid targets)
    theta2 = theta2_1
    A = 0.425 * np.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615
    denominator = A**2 + B**2
    cos_theta1 = (A * x_target + B * y_target) / denominator

```

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**: The z-coordinate of the target position directly gives theta2 using the inverse cosine function. The x and y coordinates are used to form a system of linear equations solved for theta1 using matrix inversion.
2. **Orientation Check**: After calculating potential solutions for theta1 and theta2, we check which solution matches the target orientation by comparing the derived rotation matrix with the target rotation matrix. This ensures that both position and orientation constraints are satisfied.

This approach efficiently combines position and orientation constraints to determine the correct joint angles, ensuring the robotic arm reaches the desired configuration.
