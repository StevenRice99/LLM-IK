To solve this problem, we need to compute the joint angles for a 2-DOF robot arm such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches both a desired position and orientation. The solution must consider both the position and orientation constraints provided as inputs.

### Approach
The robot arm has two revolute joints:
1. The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Z-axis.
2. The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Y-axis.

The key insight is that the orientation of the TCP is determined by the joint angles, which are also determined by the desired position and orientation. The orientation of the TCP is derived from the combined rotations of the two joints. Given the problem constraints, the desired orientation must be compatible with the position, and we can compute the joint angles using the position and orientation.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Compute theta2 based on the desired orientation's pitch (r_y)
    theta2 = math.pi - r_y

    # Compute theta1 using the position's x and y coordinates
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**: The joint angles are computed based on the desired position using geometric and trigonometric relationships. The second joint angle (theta2) is derived from the orientation's pitch component (r_y) using the relationship `theta2 = π - r_y`. This ensures that the computed theta2 satisfies the orientation constraint.
2. **Orientation Consideration**: The orientation of the TCP is inherently determined by the computed joint angles (theta1 and theta2). The first joint angle (theta1) is computed using the position's x and y coordinates, ensuring the correct yaw component (r_z) is achieved through the geometric configuration.

This approach efficiently combines the position and orientation constraints by leveraging the geometric relationships inherent in the robot's structure, ensuring that the computed joint angles meet both requirements.
