To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) for a 3-DOF serial manipulator such that the Tool Center Point (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves correctly accounting for the geometric configuration of the manipulator, including the Y-axis offset between joints, and solving the inverse kinematics using a planar 2R approach with corrected parameters.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Handling**: The first joint (theta1) is determined by the target's yaw component (rz). The sum of the second and third joint angles (theta_sum) is derived from the target's pitch component (ry).
2. **Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted to account for the first joint's rotation and translation. The remaining position is transformed into the coordinate system of the second joint.
3. **Planar 2R Solution**: The corrected parameters (considering the Y-axis offset) are used to solve the planar inverse kinematics problem for the second and third joints.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Solve for theta1 from the orientation (rz)
    theta1 = rz

    # Adjust the target position to Revolute2's frame
    x_remaining = x_target - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    y_remaining = y_target - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    z_remaining = z_target

    # Rotate the remaining position by -theta1 to get into Revolute2's frame
    x_revolute2 = x_remaining * math.cos(theta1) + y_remaining * math.sin(theta1)
    z_revolute2 = z_remaining

    # Parameters for the planar 2R arm (Revolute2 and Revolute3) considering Y offset
    a = math.sqrt((-0.1197)**2 + 0.425**2)  # Corrected distance from Revolute2 to Revolute3
    b = 0.39225  # Distance from Revolute3 to TCP
    theta_sum = ry  # theta2 + theta3

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the planar solution
    d_sq = x_revolute2 ** 2 + z_revolute2 ** 2
    d = math.sqrt(d_sq)
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a ** 2 - b ** 2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2_1 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_2 = -theta2_1

    solutions = []
    for theta2 in [theta2_1, theta2_2]:
        theta3 = theta_sum - theta2
        # Calculate the expected position based on theta2 and theta_sum
        x_calc = a * math.sin(theta2) + b * math.sin(theta_sum)
        z_calc = a * math.cos(theta2) + b * math.cos(theta_sum)
        if math.isclose(x_calc, x_revolute2, abs_tol=1e-5) and math.isclose(z_calc, z_revolute2, abs_tol=1e-5):
            solutions.append((theta2, theta3))

    if solutions:
        # Select the first valid solution within joint limits
        for theta2, theta3 in solutions:
            if -6.2831853 <= theta2 <= 6.2831853 and -6.2831853 <= theta3 <= 6.2831853:
                return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
        theta2, theta3 = solutions[0]
    else:
        # Fallback to geometric solution if no valid solutions found
        term_x = x_revolute2 - b * math.sin(theta_sum)
        term_z = z_revolute2 - b * math.cos(theta_sum)
        theta2 = math.atan2(term_x, term_z)
        theta3 = theta_sum - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Handling**: The first joint angle (theta1) is set to the target yaw (rz), and the sum of the second and third joint angles (theta_sum) is set to the target pitch (ry).
2. **Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted to account for the first joint's rotation and translation. The remaining position is transformed into the coordinate system of the second joint.
3. **Corrected Planar Solution**: The planar 2R problem is solved using the corrected distance (a) between the second and third joints, which includes the Y-axis offset. This ensures accurate calculation of the joint angles theta2 and theta3 to reach the target position.
