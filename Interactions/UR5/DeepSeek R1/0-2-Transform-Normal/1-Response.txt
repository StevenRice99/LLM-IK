To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) for a 3-DOF serial manipulator such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves using trigonometric identities and inverse kinematics equations derived from the robot's structure and desired orientation constraints.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Analysis**: The desired orientation is given as Roll-Pitch-Yaw (RPY) angles. The robot's structure allows us to directly relate the yaw component (rz) to the first joint angle (theta1) and the pitch component (ry) to the sum of the second and third joint angles (theta2 + theta3).
2. **Position Analysis**: Using the derived orientation angles, we solve for the individual joint angles theta2 and theta3 by considering the geometric relationships and trigonometric identities. The position equations are solved using the arctangent function to handle both sine and cosine components, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    rx, ry, rz = r
    theta1 = rz  # theta1 is directly the yaw component of the orientation
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the position equations
    cos_th2 = (p[2] - 0.39225 * np.cos(ry)) / 0.425
    numerator_sin = (p[0] * np.cos(theta1) + p[1] * np.sin(theta1)) - 0.39225 * np.sin(ry)
    sin_th2 = numerator_sin / 0.425
    theta2 = np.arctan2(sin_th2, cos_th2)
    
    # Theta3 is determined by the remaining angle to achieve the desired pitch (ry)
    theta3 = ry - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Handling**: The first joint angle (theta1) is set directly to the yaw component (rz) of the desired orientation. This is because the first joint rotates around the Z-axis, which directly affects the yaw of the end-effector.
2. **Position Handling**: The second and third joint angles (theta2 and theta3) are derived from the desired position (p) and the pitch component (ry) of the orientation. Using trigonometric identities and the arctangent function, we solve for theta2 by considering both the cosine and sine components derived from the position equations. The third joint angle (theta3) is then calculated as the difference between the desired pitch (ry) and theta2, ensuring the sum of theta2 and theta3 equals the pitch component.

This approach efficiently combines orientation and position constraints to derive the joint angles, ensuring the robot's end-effector reaches the target pose accurately.
