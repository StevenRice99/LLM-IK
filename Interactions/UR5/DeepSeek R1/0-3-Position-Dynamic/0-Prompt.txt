<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are tasked with producing a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 4 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator solving for the position of the TCP as detailed in the "DETAILS" section by completing the Python function provided in the "CODE" section. The "Position" and "Orientation" columns represent link coordinates in local space relative to their parent link. The positions are from the "xyz" attribute and the orientations are the "rpy" attribute from each link's "origin" element parsed from the URDF. The "Axis" column in the table represents the rotational axis of the revolute links; return their values in radians and their limits are in radians. Do not write any code to run or test the method, as this will be handled for you. Assume all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable, and as such do not write code to check if the target is reachable. You may use any methods included in Python, NumPy, and SymPy to write your solution except for any optimization methods. To help you, solutions for sub-chains have been provided in the "EXISTING" sections. Each code solved a sub-link assuming their last link was the position being solved for. You can use these solutions as a starting point to extend for the entire chain.
Existing code 1 solved joint 1.
Existing code 2 solved joints 3 to 5. You may respond by either completing the inverse kinematics method or calling either of the two provided functions in the "FUNCTIONS" section to help you develop your solution. If you call a function, you will be provided another response and chance to complete the inverse kinematics method. You may only call a single function per response.
