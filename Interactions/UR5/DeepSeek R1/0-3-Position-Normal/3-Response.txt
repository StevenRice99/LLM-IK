To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1 to theta4) for a 4-DOF robotic arm to position its Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position (x, y, z). The solution involves using geometric and trigonometric methods to derive the joint angles based on the structure and transformations of the robotic arm.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robotic arm consists of four revolute joints. The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, and the subsequent three joints rotate around the Y-axis. The goal is to compute the joint angles such that the TCP reaches the target position.

2. **Forward Kinematics**: The position of the TCP is derived by considering the transformations (rotations and translations) of each joint relative to its parent link. The transformations are combined using homogeneous transformation matrices.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - **Joint 1 (q1)**: Determined by aligning the projection of the target position onto the XY plane.
   - **Joints 2 and 3 (q2, q3)**: Solved using geometric relationships in the plane formed after considering the rotation from joint 1.
   - **Joint 4 (q4)**: Since the TCP's position is independent of q4, it can be set to zero as it does not affect the position.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Compute q3 using the derived equation
    numerator = x**2 + y**2 + z**2 - 0.346395
    denominator = 0.3341625
    cos_q3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)  # Ensure within valid range for arccos
    q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)

    # Compute A and B based on q3
    A = 0.425 + 0.39225 * np.cos(q3)
    B = 0.39225 * np.sin(q3)

    # Compute S and C
    S_squared = x**2 + y**2 - 0.10915**2
    S = np.sqrt(S_squared) if S_squared >= 0 else 0.0
    C = z

    # Compute q2
    numerator_q2 = S * A - C * B
    denominator_q2 = S * B + C * A
    q2 = np.arctan2(numerator_q2, denominator_q2)

    # Compute q1
    phi = np.arctan2(0.10915, S) if S != 0 else np.pi / 2
    q1 = np.arctan2(y, x) - phi

    # Normalize q1 to [-pi, pi]
    q1 = (q1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi

    # q4 does not affect position, set to 0
    q4 = 0.0

    return (q1, q2, q3, q4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint 1 (q1)**: The angle is computed by aligning the projection of the target position onto the XY plane. This is done using the arctangent function to determine the direction from the base to the projected target.

2. **Joints 2 and 3 (q2, q3)**: These angles are determined by solving the geometric relationships in the plane formed after the rotation from joint 1. The equations involve trigonometric identities and matrix operations to solve for the angles that position the TCP correctly.

3. **Joint 4 (q4)**: Since the position of the TCP is independent of q4, it is set to zero. This simplifies the problem as the orientation of the TCP is not required for positioning.

This approach ensures that the robotic arm's TCP reaches the target position by solving the inverse kinematics using geometric and trigonometric methods, considering the structure and transformations of the arm.
