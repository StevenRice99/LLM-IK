To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position. The solution involves correcting the initial approach's errors in calculating the first joint angle and adjusting the planar arm parameters to account for the end effector's offset.

### Approach
1. **Correct Calculation of the First Joint (q1):** The initial approach had an incorrect equation for determining the first joint angle. The correct equation is derived from the geometry of the arm and ensures the projection of the target position onto the plane of the subsequent joints is accurate.
2. **Planar Arm Parameters Adjustment:** The subsequent joints (q2, q3, q4) are treated as a planar arm. The lengths of the links are adjusted to include the end effector's offset, simplifying the problem to a 2R inverse kinematics problem.
3. **Handling Multiple Solutions:** The inverse kinematics for the planar arm can have multiple solutions. We consider both positive and negative solutions for the third joint (q3) and select the appropriate one based on geometric feasibility.
4. **End Effector Orientation:** The fourth joint (q4) is set to maintain the end effector's orientation by ensuring the sum of the joint angles (q2 + q3 + q4) is zero.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Correct equation for q1: x*sin(q1) + y*cos(q1) = 0.13585
    A = x
    B = y
    C = 0.13585
    theta = np.arctan2(B, A)
    D = np.hypot(A, B)
    if D < 1e-7:
        q1 = 0.0
    else:
        alpha = np.arcsin(C / D)
        q1 = theta - alpha

    # Compute planar coordinates in Revolute 2's frame
    dx = (x - 0.13585 * np.sin(q1)) / np.cos(q1) if abs(np.cos(q1)) > 1e-7 else 0
    dz = z

    # Planar arm parameters including TCP offset in L2_eff
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = 0.093
    L2_eff = L2 + L3  # Combine L2 and L3 for 2R IK

    wx, wz = dx, dz
    D_sq = wx**2 + wz**2

    # Check if target is reachable (D_sq should be within [ (L1 - L2_eff)^2, (L1 + L2_eff)^2 ])
    cos_q3 = (D_sq - L1**2 - L2_eff**2) / (2 * L1 * L2_eff)
    cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)
    q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)

    # Two possible solutions for q3
    q3_pos = q3
    q3_neg = -q3

    # Calculate corresponding q2 for both solutions
    angle_offset_pos = np.arctan2(L2_eff * np.sin(q3_pos), L1 + L2_eff * np.cos(q3_pos))
    q2_pos = np.arctan2(wx, wz) - angle_offset_pos

    angle_offset_neg = np.arctan2(L2_eff * np.sin(q3_neg), L1 + L2_eff * np.cos(q3_neg))
    q2_neg = np.arctan2(wx, wz) - angle_offset_neg

    # Select solution with elbow up or down based on feasibility
    # Prefer solution where q3 is negative to match typical configurations
    if L1 + L2_eff * np.cos(q3_neg) >= 0:
        q2, q3 = q2_neg, q3_neg
    else:
        q2, q3 = q2_pos, q3_pos

    # Set q4 to maintain end effector orientation (sum to zero)
    q4 = - (q2 + q3)

    return (q1 % (2 * np.pi), q2, q3, q4)
```

### Explanation
1. **First Joint (q1):** The angle is calculated using the corrected equation to ensure the projection of the target onto the plane of the subsequent joints is accurate.
2. **Planar Arm Calculation:** The problem is simplified to a 2R inverse kinematics problem by combining the lengths of the last two links and the end effector. This allows us to solve for the second and third joints (q2 and q3) using geometric methods.
3. **Handling Multiple Solutions:** Both possible solutions for the third joint (q3) are considered, and the appropriate solution is selected based on geometric feasibility.
4. **End Effector Orientation:** The fourth joint (q4) is determined to maintain the end effector's orientation by ensuring the sum of the joint angles (q2 + q3 + q4) is zero, which simplifies the orientation constraint.

This approach ensures that the robotic arm reaches the target position while maintaining a feasible configuration, addressing the issues identified in the initial solution.
