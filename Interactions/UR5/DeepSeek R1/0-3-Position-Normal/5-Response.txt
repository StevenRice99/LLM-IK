To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position. The solution involves calculating the base rotation and then solving the planar inverse kinematics for the remaining joints.

### Approach
1. **Base Rotation (θ₁)**: Calculate the rotation around the Z-axis to align the arm with the target's x-y direction.
2. **Planar Kinematics**: After aligning with the target's x-y direction, the problem reduces to a planar problem in the Y-Z plane. Here, we solve for the remaining joints (θ₂, θ₃, θ₄) using geometric methods.
3. **Geometric Solution**: Use the law of cosines and trigonometric identities to determine the angles for the planar links, ensuring the target position is reachable.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate θ₁ to align with target's x-y direction
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Radial distance in x-y plane after θ₁ rotation
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    
    # Adjust target to the rotated frame (Y-Z plane)
    # Joint2's position in world frame is (0, 0.13585, 0)
    z_rel = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for joint2's height
    
    # Distance from joint2 to target in Y-Z plane
    d = math.hypot(r, z_rel)
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = math.hypot(0.1197, 0.425)  # From joint2 to joint3: 0.4415
    L2 = 0.39225                    # From joint3 to joint4
    L3 = 0.093                       # From joint4 to TCP
    L23 = L2 + L3                    # Combined length
    
    # Law of cosines to find angle between L1 and L23
    cos_theta3 = (L1**2 + L23**2 - d**2) / (2 * L1 * L23)
    # Clamp to avoid numerical errors (though problem states targets are reachable)
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using geometric relationships
    alpha = math.atan2(z_rel, r)
    beta = math.atan2(L23 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L23 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Adjust theta3 to represent the joint angle (considering link orientation)
    theta3 = -theta3  # Invert due to link direction
    
    # Theta4 is set to zero for simplicity, assuming the target orientation is handled
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Base Rotation (θ₁)**: The first joint rotates the arm to face the target in the x-y plane using `atan2(y, x)`.
2. **Planar Adjustment**: The target's z-coordinate is adjusted relative to the second joint's position.
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute the distance from the second joint to the target in the Y-Z plane.
4. **Link Lengths**: Define the lengths of the links based on the provided URDF parameters.
5. **Law of Cosines**: Calculate the angle between the first and combined links using the law of cosines, ensuring the argument to `acos` is within valid bounds.
6. **Angle Calculations**: Use trigonometric identities to determine the remaining angles, adjusting for the mechanical configuration of the arm.

This approach efficiently decomposes the problem into manageable parts, ensuring the solution is both accurate and computationally feasible.
