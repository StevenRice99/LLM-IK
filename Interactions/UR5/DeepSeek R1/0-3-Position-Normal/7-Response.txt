To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position. The key corrections involve deriving the correct equation for the first joint angle and properly handling the planar arm parameters to account for the end effector's offset.

### Approach
1. **First Joint Calculation (q1):** The first joint angle is determined using the Y component of the target position, ensuring the projection onto the subsequent planar arm is feasible.
2. **Planar Arm Parameters:** The lengths of the links in the planar arm are adjusted to include the end effector's offset, simplifying the problem to a 2R inverse kinematics problem.
3. **Multiple Solutions Handling:** Both possible solutions for the third joint (elbow-up and elbow-down) are considered to ensure the correct configuration is selected.
4. **Orientation Maintenance:** The fourth joint angle is set to maintain the end effector's orientation by ensuring the sum of the joint angles (q2 + q3 + q4) is zero.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Correctly compute q1 from the Y component equation
    y_adjusted = y_target + 0.0267  # 0.13585*cos(q1) - 0.1197 + 0.093 = y_target => cos(q1) = (y_target + 0.0267)/0.13585
    cos_q1 = y_adjusted / 0.13585
    cos_q1 = np.clip(cos_q1, -1.0, 1.0)

        L2 = 0.39225
        L3 = 0.093  # TCP offset in Y, but affects Z in planar arm

        # Adjust target for TCP's Z offset (Revolute 4's Z + TCP's Z)
        target_z = dz - L3  # Subtract TCP's Z offset from target

        # Solve 2R IK for L1 and L2
        D_sq = dx**2 + target_z**2
        cos_q3 = (D_sq - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)

            continue

        q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)
        q3_neg = -q3

        # Calculate possible solutions for q2

            if np.isclose(x_sol, dx, atol=1e-5) and np.isclose(z_sol, dz, atol=1e-5):
                q4_sol = - (q2_sol + q3_sol)
                valid_solutions.append((q1, q2_sol, q3_sol, q4_sol))

    # Select the first valid solution (assumes at least one exists)
    if valid_solutions:
        q1, q2, q3, q4 = valid_solutions[0]
        return (q1 % (2*np.pi), q2 % (2*np.pi), q3 % (2*np.pi), q4 % (2*np.pi))
    else:
        # Fallback to previous method if no solution found (should not occur per problem statement)

### Explanation
1. **First Joint (q1):** The angle is calculated using the Y component of the target position, ensuring the projection is within the feasible workspace of the planar arm.
2. **Planar Arm Calculation:** The problem is simplified to a 2R inverse kinematics problem by adjusting the target Z coordinate to account for the end effector's offset.
3. **Multiple Solutions Handling:** Both possible solutions for the third joint are considered, and the appropriate solution is selected based on geometric feasibility.
4. **Orientation Maintenance:** The fourth joint angle is determined to ensure the end effector's orientation remains consistent by balancing the sum of the joint angles.

This approach addresses the issues in the previous solutions by correctly deriving the first joint angle equation and properly handling the planar arm parameters, ensuring accurate and feasible joint configurations for all reachable targets.
