To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position. The key corrections involve accurately computing the first joint angle and ensuring the planar arm parameters are correctly handled.

### Approach
1. **First Joint Calculation (q1):** The first joint angle is derived from the target's Y component, considering the fixed offsets in the kinematic chain.
2. **Planar Arm Parameters:** The problem is simplified to a 2R inverse kinematics problem by adjusting the target coordinates to account for the end effector's offset.
3. **Multiple Solutions Handling:** Both possible solutions for the third joint (elbow-up and elbow-down) are considered, and the correct one is selected based on geometric feasibility.
4. **Orientation Maintenance:** The fourth joint angle is set to maintain the end effector's orientation by ensuring the sum of the joint angles (q2 + q3 + q4) is zero.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Correct equation for q1 derived from the Y component constraint
    y_adjusted = y_target + 0.0267  # 0.13585*cos(q1) = y_target + 0.0267
    cos_q1 = y_adjusted / 0.13585
    cos_q1 = np.clip(cos_q1, -1.0, 1.0)
    q1_pos = np.arccos(cos_q1)
    q1_neg = -q1_pos
    q1_candidates = [q1_pos, q1_neg, q1_pos - 2*np.pi, q1_neg + 2*np.pi]

    valid_solutions = []
    for q1 in q1_candidates:
        # Transform target into Revolute 2's coordinate system
        x_revolute2 = 0.13585 * np.sin(q1)
        y_revolute2 = 0.13585 * np.cos(q1)
        x_prime = x_target - x_revolute2
        y_prime = y_target - y_revolute2

        # Rotate into Revolute 2's XZ plane (Y rotation)
        dx = x_prime * np.cos(q1) + y_prime * np.sin(q1)
        dz = z_target

        # Planar arm parameters (L1=0.425, L2=0.39225, L3=0.093 TCP offset)
        L1 = 0.425
        L2_eff = 0.39225 + 0.093  # Combine L2 and TCP's Z offset

        # Solve 2R IK for adjusted target (account for TCP's Z)
        target_x = dx
        target_z = dz - 0.093  # Subtract TCP's fixed Z offset

        D_sq = target_x**2 + target_z**2
        if D_sq < 1e-7:
            continue  # Avoid division by zero

        # Calculate possible q3 solutions
        cos_q3 = (D_sq - L1**2 - L2_eff**2) / (2 * L1 * L2_eff)
        cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)
        q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)
        q3_neg = -q3

        # Calculate corresponding q2 for both q3 solutions
        for q3_sol in [q3, q3_neg]:
            denominator = L1 + L2_eff * np.cos(q3_sol)
            numerator = L2_eff * np.sin(q3_sol)
            angle_offset = np.arctan2(numerator, denominator)
            q2 = np.arctan2(target_x, target_z) - angle_offset

            # Check if this solution reaches the target
            x_sol = L1 * np.sin(q2) + L2_eff * np.sin(q2 + q3_sol)
            z_sol = L1 * np.cos(q2) + L2_eff * np.cos(q2 + q3_sol) + 0.093
            if np.isclose(x_sol, dx, atol=1e-5) and np.isclose(z_sol, dz, atol=1e-5):
                q4 = - (q2 + q3_sol)
                valid_solutions.append((q1, q2, q3_sol, q4))

    # Select the first valid solution (problem states target is reachable)
    if valid_solutions:
        q1, q2, q3, q4 = valid_solutions[0]
        return (q1 % (2*np.pi), q2 % (2*np.pi), q3 % (2*np.pi), q4 % (2*np.pi))
    else:
        return (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

### Explanation
1. **First Joint (q1):** The angle is calculated using the target's Y component, adjusted for fixed offsets. Multiple candidates for q1 are considered to ensure the correct quadrant is selected.
2. **Planar Arm Calculation:** The target coordinates are transformed into Revolute 2's frame, adjusting for the end effector's offset. The problem is treated as a 2R planar arm, solving for q2 and q3 using geometric methods.
3. **Multiple Solutions Handling:** Both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations are considered, and the solution that accurately reaches the target is selected.
4. **Orientation Maintenance:** The fourth joint angle is set to ensure the end effector's orientation remains consistent by balancing the sum of the joint angles.

This approach ensures accurate and feasible joint configurations by correctly handling transformations and considering all possible solutions.
