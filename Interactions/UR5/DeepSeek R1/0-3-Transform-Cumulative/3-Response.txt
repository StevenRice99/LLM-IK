To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF serial manipulator to reach a target position and orientation. The solution involves adjusting the target position to account for the TCP's offset and correctly handling the orientation using inverse kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Adjust Target Position:** The target position given is for the TCP, which has an offset of 0.093 meters along the Y-axis relative to Revolute 4. We adjust the target position by subtracting this offset to find the position of Revolute 4.
2. **Compute Theta1 (Joint 1):** Calculate the first joint angle using the adjusted target position's x and y components.
3. **Transform Position to Revolute 2's Frame:** Adjust the target position relative to Revolute 2 and rotate it into the plane defined by theta1.
4. **Solve Planar Inverse Kinematics:** Use the transformed position to solve for the remaining joint angles (theta2, theta3, theta4) considering the link lengths and orientation constraints.

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Target Position:** The target position is adjusted to account for the TCP's Y-axis offset, ensuring the correct position of Revolute 4.
2. **Theta1 Calculation:** The first joint angle is determined using the arctangent of the adjusted target's x and y components.
3. **Position Transformation:** The target position is transformed into the coordinate system relative to Revolute 2 and rotated into the plane defined by theta1.
4. **Orientation Handling:** The target orientation is adjusted by rotating it back by theta1 to align with the planar problem.
5. **Planar Inverse Kinematics:** The remaining joint angles are solved using a planar approach, considering link lengths and orientation constraints to find the optimal solution.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are accurately reached by considering all necessary adjustments and constraints.
