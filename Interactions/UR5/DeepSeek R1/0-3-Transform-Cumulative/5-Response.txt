To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF serial manipulator to reach a target position and orientation, considering the TCP's offset and the robot's kinematic structure.

### Approach
1. **Adjust Target Position:** The target position is adjusted by subtracting the TCP's offset transformed by the target orientation. This gives the position of Revolute 4's origin (P4).
2. **Compute Theta1 (Joint 1):** Calculate the first joint angle using the x and y components of the adjusted position (P4).
3. **Transform Position to Revolute 2's Frame:** Adjust the position relative to Revolute 2 and rotate it into the plane defined by theta1.
4. **Solve Planar Inverse Kinematics:** Use the transformed position to solve for theta2 and theta3, considering the link lengths.
5. **Compute Theta4 (Joint 4):** Determine theta4 to match the target orientation using the remaining rotation matrix.

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Target Position:** The target position is adjusted by transforming the TCP's offset using the target orientation matrix, giving the position of Revolute 4's origin (P4).
2. **Theta1 Calculation:** The first joint angle is determined using the arctangent of the adjusted position's x and y components.
3. **Position Transformation:** The target position is transformed into the coordinate system relative to Revolute 2 and rotated into the plane defined by theta1.
4. **Planar Inverse Kinematics:** The remaining joint angles (theta2 and theta3) are solved using a planar approach to reach the transformed position.
5. **Theta4 Calculation:** The fourth joint angle is computed to match the target orientation by solving the remaining rotation matrix.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are accurately reached by considering the kinematic chain and transforming the TCP's offset correctly.
