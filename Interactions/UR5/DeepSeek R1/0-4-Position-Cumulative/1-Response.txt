To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF serial manipulator to reach a specified target position (x, y, z). The solution involves using existing sub-problem solutions and extending them to handle all five joints. The key steps involve solving for the first three joints to position the fourth joint's origin and then setting the remaining joints to zero since they do not affect the position of the end effector in this specific problem setup.

### Approach
1. **Existing Code Utilization**: Use the provided existing code that solves the inverse kinematics for the first four joints (even though the problem specifies five joints, the fifth joint's rotation does not affect the position and can be set to zero).
2. **Adjust for Five Joints**: Extend the solution to include the fifth joint by setting its angle to zero, as it does not influence the position of the TCP (Tool Center Point).

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    D = 0.13585 - 0.1197 + 0.093  # Combined offset from joint2 to joint4
    L1 = 0.425                     # Length of the first link
    a = 0.39225                    # Length of the second link

    numerator = x ** 2 + y ** 2 + z ** 2 - D ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - a ** 2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * a
    if abs(denominator) < 1e-06:
        raise ValueError('Denominator is zero')
    cos_theta3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3_1 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    theta3_2 = -theta3_1
    solutions = []
    for theta3 in [theta3_1, theta3_2]:
        C1 = L1 + a * np.cos(theta3)
        C2 = a * np.sin(theta3)
        A_squared = x ** 2 + y ** 2 - D ** 2
        if A_squared < 0:
            continue
        for A_sign in [1, -1]:
            A = A_sign * np.sqrt(A_squared)
            denom = C1 ** 2 + C2 ** 2
            if denom == 0:
                continue
            sin_theta2 = (C1 * A - C2 * z) / denom
            cos_theta2 = (C2 * A + C1 * z) / denom
            if abs(sin_theta2) > 1 or abs(cos_theta2) > 1:
                continue
            theta2 = np.arctan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
            denom_theta1 = A ** 2 + D ** 2
            if denom_theta1 == 0:
                continue
            cos_theta1 = (A * x + D * y) / denom_theta1
            sin_theta1 = (-D * x + A * y) / denom_theta1
            theta1 = np.arctan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
            solutions.append((theta1, theta2, theta3))
    if not solutions:
        raise ValueError('No valid solutions found')
    theta1, theta2, theta3 = min(solutions, key=lambda s: abs(s[2]))
    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Existing Code Adaptation**: The solution uses existing code that solves for the first three joints and part of the fourth joint. This code calculates the angles for the first three joints (theta1, theta2, theta3) to position the fourth joint's origin.
2. **Handling Remaining Joints**: The fourth joint (theta4) is set to zero, and the fifth joint (theta5) is also set to zero. This is based on the assumption that the problem does not require specific orientation control, and the fifth joint's rotation does not affect the position of the TCP.
3. **Validation**: The code checks for valid solutions and raises an error if none are found, ensuring the target position is reachable.

This approach efficiently combines existing solutions and extends them to handle all five joints, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.
