To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF serial manipulator to reach a target position. The key insight is that the fifth joint's rotation does not affect the position of the TCP due to its offset along the Z-axis. Thus, we can solve the first four joints to position the TCP and set the fifth joint angle to zero.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The TCP's position is determined by the first four joints, as the fifth joint's rotation around the Z-axis does not affect the position due to the offset along the same axis.
2. **Adjust Target Position**: Adjust the target position to account for the offset from the fourth joint's origin to the TCP.
3. **Solve for Joints 1-3**: Use the existing solution for the first three joints to position the fourth joint's origin.
4. **Compute Joint 4**: Calculate the fourth joint angle based on the difference between the target position and the computed position of the fourth joint's origin.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Adjust target for the fixed Y offset from joint4 to TCP
    y_p4 = y_target - 0.093
    
    # Solve for q1, q2, q3 using the existing code4 approach with adjusted y
    x = x_target
    y = y_p4
    z = z_target
    
    numerator = x**2 + y**2 + z**2 - 0.346395
    denominator = 0.3341625
    cos_q3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)
    q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)
    A = 0.425 + 0.39225 * np.cos(q3)
    B = 0.39225 * np.sin(q3)
    S_squared = x**2 + y**2 - 0.10915**2
    S = np.sqrt(S_squared) if S_squared >= 0 else 0.0
    C = z
    numerator_q2 = S * A - C * B
    denominator_q2 = S * B + C * A
    q2 = np.arctan2(numerator_q2, denominator_q2)
    phi = np.arctan2(0.10915, S) if S != 0 else np.pi / 2
    q1 = np.arctan2(y, x) - phi
    q1 = (q1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi
    
    # Compute P4's position using forward kinematics
    P4_x = 0.39225 * np.sin(q2) * np.cos(q1) + 0.1197 * np.sin(q1)
    P4_z = 0.425 + 0.39225 * np.cos(q2)
    
    # Compute q4 based on the remaining X and Z offsets
    dx = x_target - P4_x
    dz = z_target - P4_z
    q4 = np.arctan2(dx, dz)
    
    # Joint5 does not affect position, set to 0
    q5 = 0.0
    
    return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Target Position**: The target position is adjusted by subtracting the fixed Y offset (0.093) to get the Y component of the fourth joint's origin.
2. **Solve for Joints 1-3**: Using the adjusted target position, the first three joint angles (q1, q2, q3) are computed using geometric and trigonometric relationships to position the fourth joint's origin.
3. **Compute Joint 4**: The fourth joint angle (q4) is calculated based on the difference between the target position and the computed position of the fourth joint's origin, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position.
4. **Set Joint 5**: The fifth joint angle (q5) is set to zero as it does not affect the position of the TCP.
