To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF serial manipulator to reach a specified target position (x, y, z). The solution involves adjusting the parameters of the existing code to account for the full kinematic chain up to the Tool Center Point (TCP), including the offsets from Revolute4 to Revolute5 and the TCP.

### Approach
1. **Parameter Adjustment**: Correct the parameters in the existing code to include the TCP's z-offset, which was previously missing. This ensures the geometric model accurately represents the entire kinematic chain.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Calculation**: Use the geometric approach from the existing code but with updated parameters to solve for the first four joints, ensuring the TCP's position is correctly modeled.
3. **Joint Angles**: Set the fifth joint angle to zero since it does not affect the position of the TCP (only orientation).

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    D = 0.13585 - 0.1197 + 0.093  # Combined y-offset from joint2 to joint5
    L1 = 0.425                     # Length from joint2 to joint3 (z-axis)
    a = 0.39225 + 0.09465          # Combined length from joint3 to TCP (z-axis)

    numerator = x ** 2 + y ** 2 + z ** 2 - D ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - a ** 2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * a
    if abs(denominator) < 1e-06:
        raise ValueError('Denominator is zero')
    cos_theta3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3_1 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    theta3_2 = -theta3_1
    solutions = []
    for theta3 in [theta3_1, theta3_2]:
        C1 = L1 + a * np.cos(theta3)
        C2 = a * np.sin(theta3)
        A_squared = x ** 2 + y ** 2 - D ** 2
        if A_squared < 0:
            continue
        for A_sign in [1, -1]:
            A = A_sign * np.sqrt(A_squared)
            denom = C1 ** 2 + C2 ** 2
            if denom == 0:
                continue
            sin_theta2 = (C1 * A - C2 * z) / denom
            cos_theta2 = (C2 * A + C1 * z) / denom
            if abs(sin_theta2) > 1 or abs(cos_theta2) > 1:
                continue
            theta2 = np.arctan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
            denom_theta1 = A ** 2 + D ** 2
            if denom_theta1 == 0:
                continue
            cos_theta1 = (A * x + D * y) / denom_theta1
            sin_theta1 = (-D * x + A * y) / denom_theta1
            theta1 = np.arctan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
            solutions.append((theta1, theta2, theta3))
    if not solutions:
        raise ValueError('No valid solutions found')
    theta1, theta2, theta3 = min(solutions, key=lambda s: abs(s[2]))
    theta4 = 0.0  # Assuming theta4 does not affect position for this setup
    theta5 = 0.0  # Theta5 does not affect position, set to 0
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Parameter Adjustment**: The parameters `D`, `L1`, and `a` are adjusted to include the cumulative offsets from Revolute2 to Revolute5 and the TCP. This ensures the geometric model accounts for the entire kinematic chain.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Calculation**: The solution uses a geometric approach to solve for the first three joints (theta1, theta2, theta3) and sets theta4 and theta5 to zero, as they do not affect the position of the TCP in this setup.
3. **Validation**: The code checks for valid solutions and raises an error if none are found, ensuring the target position is reachable.

This approach corrects the parameters in the existing code to accurately model the robot's kinematics, allowing valid solutions to be found for the target position.
