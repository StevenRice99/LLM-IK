To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF serial manipulator to reach a specified target position (x, y, z). The solution involves correctly modeling the kinematic chain up to the Tool Center Point (TCP) and adjusting the parameters to account for all relevant link lengths and offsets. The key steps include solving for the first three joints to position the TCP and setting the remaining joints to zero since they do not affect the position.

### Approach
1. **Parameter Adjustment**: Correctly calculate the parameters to include all link lengths and offsets from the base to the TCP, ensuring the geometric model accurately represents the entire kinematic chain.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Calculation**: Use a geometric approach to solve for the first three joints (theta1, theta2, theta3) to position the TCP correctly.
3. **Joint Angles**: Set the fourth and fifth joint angles to zero since they do not affect the position of the TCP (only orientation).

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    # Corrected parameters considering the full kinematic chain up to TCP
    D = 0.13585 - 0.1197 + 0.093  # Total y-offset from joint2 to joint5
    L1 = 0.425                    # Z-axis distance from joint2 to joint3
    a = 0.39225 + 0.09465         # Combined Z-axis distance from joint3 to TCP (joint3 to joint4 + joint5 to TCP)

    numerator = x**2 + y**2 + z**2 - D**2 - L1**2 - a**2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * a
    if abs(denominator) < 1e-6:
        raise ValueError('Denominator is zero')
    cos_theta3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3_1 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    theta3_2 = -theta3_1

    solutions = []
    for theta3 in [theta3_1, theta3_2]:
        C1 = L1 + a * np.cos(theta3)
        C2 = a * np.sin(theta3)
        A_squared = x**2 + y**2 - D**2
        if A_squared < 0:
            continue
        for A_sign in [1, -1]:
            A = A_sign * np.sqrt(A_squared)
            denom = C1**2 + C2**2
            if denom == 0:
                continue
            sin_theta2 = (C1 * A - C2 * z) / denom
            cos_theta2 = (C2 * A + C1 * z) / denom
            if abs(sin_theta2) > 1 or abs(cos_theta2) > 1:
                continue
            theta2 = np.arctan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
            denom_theta1 = A**2 + D**2
            if denom_theta1 == 0:
                continue
            cos_theta1 = (A * x + D * y) / denom_theta1
            sin_theta1 = (-D * x + A * y) / denom_theta1
            theta1 = np.arctan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
            solutions.append((theta1, theta2, theta3))

    if not solutions:
        raise ValueError('No valid solutions found')

    # Select the solution with theta3 closest to zero (avoiding pi wrapping)
    theta1, theta2, theta3 = min(solutions, key=lambda s: abs(s[2]))
    theta4 = 0.0  # Joint4 does not affect position
    theta5 = 0.0  # Joint5 does not affect position
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Parameter Adjustment**: The parameters `D`, `L1`, and `a` are adjusted to include the cumulative offsets from Revolute2 to the TCP. This ensures the geometric model accounts for the entire kinematic chain, including the TCP's position relative to Revolute5.
2. **Inverse Kinematics Calculation**: The solution uses a geometric approach to solve for the first three joints (theta1, theta2, theta3) by forming a triangle between the base, joint3, and the TCP. The law of cosines is applied to determine theta3, and subsequent trigonometric calculations yield theta1 and theta2.
3. **Solution Selection**: The solution with theta3 closest to zero is selected to avoid issues with angle wrapping around Ï€, ensuring a more natural joint configuration.
4. **Remaining Joints**: The fourth and fifth joints are set to zero since they do not affect the position of the TCP, focusing solely on reaching the target position.

This approach corrects the parameters and solution selection process, ensuring valid solutions are found for the target position.
