To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF serial manipulator to reach a target position. The key insight is to correctly model the forward kinematics up to the fourth joint and then compute the fourth joint angle to account for the TCP's offset. The fifth joint's rotation does not affect the position, so it is set to zero.

### Approach
1. **Adjust Target Position**: Adjust the target position to account for the fixed Y offset from the fourth joint to the TCP.
2. **Solve for Joints 1-3**: Use the existing solution for the first three joints to position the fourth joint's origin, considering both possible solutions for the third joint angle (positive and negative).
3. **Compute Joint 4**: Calculate the fourth joint angle based on the remaining displacement from the fourth joint's origin to the target, considering the rotation around the Y-axis.

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Target Position**: The target position is adjusted by subtracting the fixed Y offset (0.093) to account for the offset from the fourth joint to the TCP.
2. **Solve for Joints 1-3**: The first three joint angles are computed using geometric and trigonometric relationships, considering both possible solutions for the third joint angle (positive and negative).
3. **Compute Joint 4**: The fourth joint angle is calculated based on the remaining displacement from the fourth joint's origin to the target, considering the rotation around the Y-axis. The solution with the minimal residual error is selected to ensure the TCP reaches the target position.
4. **Set Joint 5**: The fifth joint angle is set to zero as it does not affect the position of the TCP.
