To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator, we break down the problem into steps involving the first three joints and the last two joints. The solution involves calculating joint angles θ1, θ2, θ3 to position the wrist (Revolute4's origin) and θ4, θ5 to adjust the TCP's position.

### Approach
1. **Calculate θ3**: Use the target position to determine θ3 by solving geometric constraints involving the lengths of the links.
2. **Calculate θ4 and θ5**: Use the target position and θ3 to solve for θ4 and θ5 using trigonometric identities.
3. **Calculate θ1 and θ2**: Use the derived wrist position and existing geometric methods to solve for θ1 and θ2.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Constants derived from the manipulator's geometry
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = 0.09465
    d = 0.10915

    # Step 1: Compute LHS for theta3 calculation
    lhs = x**2 + y**2 - d**2 + (z - c)**2

    # Step 2: Compute cos(theta3)
    numerator = lhs - (a**2 + b**2 + 2 * a * b * 0.5)  # Adjusted for accurate constants
    denominator = 2 * a * b
    cos_theta3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)

    # Step 3: Compute possible theta3 values
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    theta3_options = [theta3, -theta3]

    solutions = []
    for theta3 in theta3_options:
        # Step 4a: Compute A and B
        A = a * math.sin(theta3)
        B = a * math.cos(theta3) + b

        # Step 4c: Compute x4
        x4_sq = x**2 + y**2 - d**2
        if x4_sq < 0:
            continue
        x4 = math.sqrt(x4_sq)

        # Step 4d: Compute z4
        z4 = z - c

        # Step 4e and 4f: Compute theta4
        denom_theta4 = A**2 + B**2
        if denom_theta4 == 0:
            continue
        cos_theta4 = (A * x4 + B * z4) / denom_theta4
        sin_theta4 = (B * x4 - A * z4) / denom_theta4
        theta4 = math.atan2(sin_theta4, cos_theta4)

        # Step 4h: Compute theta5
        numerator_theta5 = x4 * y - d * x
        denominator_theta5 = x4 * x + d * y
        theta5 = math.atan2(numerator_theta5, denominator_theta5)

        # Step 5: Compute theta1 and theta2 using wrist position
        # Wrist position (x_wrist, 0.01615, z_wrist)
        x_wrist = A * math.cos(theta4) + B * math.sin(theta4)
        z_wrist = -A * math.sin(theta4) + B * math.cos(theta4)

        # Solve for theta23 (theta2 + theta3)
        theta23 = math.atan2(x_wrist, z_wrist - b)
        theta2 = theta23 - theta3

        # Solve for theta1 using the x and y components
        K = math.hypot(x_wrist, z_wrist - b)
        if K == 0:
            continue
        L = 0.01615
        denom_theta1 = K**2 + L**2
        cos_theta1 = (K * x_wrist + L * 0.01615) / denom_theta1
        sin_theta1 = (-L * x_wrist + K * 0.01615) / denom_theta1
        theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

        solutions.append((theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5))

    if not solutions:
        raise ValueError("No valid solution found")

    return solutions[0]
```

### Explanation
1. **θ3 Calculation**: The target position is used to compute the cosine of θ3 using geometric constraints derived from the manipulator's link lengths.
2. **θ4 and θ5 Calculation**: Using trigonometric identities and the derived θ3, the angles θ4 and θ5 are computed to position the end-effector correctly.
3. **θ1 and θ2 Calculation**: The wrist position is determined using θ3 and θ4, then θ1 and θ2 are computed using inverse kinematics for the first two joints, ensuring the wrist is correctly positioned.

This approach efficiently breaks down the problem into manageable steps, leveraging geometric and trigonometric principles to solve for each joint angle iteratively.
