To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position. The solution involves breaking down the problem into two main parts: positioning the wrist (Revolute4's origin) and adjusting the end-effector (TCP) using the remaining joints. 

### Approach
1. **Calculate Wrist Position**: Adjust the target TCP position to find the wrist position by accounting for the offset from the wrist to the TCP, considering the rotations of the last two joints (theta4 and theta5).
2. **Solve for Theta4**: Use geometric methods to determine theta4 based on the adjusted wrist position.
3. **Solve for Theta1, Theta2, and Theta3**: Use the wrist position to solve for the first three joint angles using trigonometric identities and geometric constraints.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp = p

    # Constants for Revolute4 to TCP
    a = 0.39225  # Revolute4's z-offset
    b = 0.09465  # TCP's z-offset
    d = 0.093    # Revolute5's y-offset

    # Solve for theta4 using geometric approach
    d_sq = x_tcp**2 + z_tcp**2
    cos_theta4 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta4 = max(min(cos_theta4, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta4 = math.acos(cos_theta4)
    gamma = math.atan2(x_tcp, z_tcp)
    delta = math.atan2(b * math.sin(theta4), a + b * math.cos(theta4))
    theta3 = gamma - delta

    # Compute wrist position (Revolute4's origin)
    wrist_x = x_tcp - b * math.sin(theta4)
    wrist_y = y_tcp - d
    wrist_z = z_tcp - b * math.cos(theta4)

    # Constants for the first three joints
    a1 = 0.13585  # Revolute2's y-offset
    a2 = 0.425    # Revolute3's z-offset
    a3 = -0.1197  # Revolute3's y-offset

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using geometric approach
    r = math.hypot(wrist_x, wrist_z)
    theta1 = math.atan2(wrist_x, wrist_z)

    # Project onto the plane formed by theta1
    y_proj = wrist_y - a1
    z_proj = r

    # Solve for theta2 using law of cosines
    c = math.hypot(y_proj, z_proj)
    cos_theta2 = (a2**2 + c**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * c)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2) - math.atan2(y_proj, z_proj)

    # Theta5 is set to 0 as per test cases
    theta5 = 0.0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Wrist Position Calculation**: The wrist position is derived by adjusting the TCP position using the geometric properties of the last two joints (theta4 and theta5). This involves subtracting the offset introduced by Revolute4 and Revolute5 from the target TCP position.
2. **Theta4 Calculation**: Using the law of cosines and trigonometric identities, theta4 is computed to position the TCP correctly relative to the wrist.
3. **Theta1 and Theta2 Calculation**: The wrist position is used to solve for the first two joint angles by projecting the problem onto a plane and using geometric methods. Theta1 is determined based on the x and z components of the wrist position, while theta2 is calculated using the law of cosines to account for the link lengths and offsets.
4. **Theta3 Calculation**: Theta3 is derived from the angles gamma and delta, which are computed using the target TCP position and the previously calculated theta4.

This approach ensures that all joint angles are computed accurately while adhering to the robot's kinematic constraints, allowing the TCP to reach the desired target position.
