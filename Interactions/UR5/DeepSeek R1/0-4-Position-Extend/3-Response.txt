To solve this problem, we need to adjust the existing inverse kinematics solution to account for the fifth link and the TCP's offset. The key insight is to correctly compute the position of the fourth link's origin and then determine the fourth joint angle (q4) to reach the target position.

### Approach
1. **Adjust Target Position**: Subtract the Y component of the fifth link's offset from the target's Y coordinate.
2. **Solve for First Three Joints**: Use the existing solution to compute the first three joint angles (q1, q2, q3) based on the adjusted target.
3. **Compute Fourth Link's Origin**: Use forward kinematics to determine the position of the fourth link's origin using the computed joint angles.
4. **Determine Fourth Joint Angle (q4)**: Calculate q4 based on the remaining X and Z offsets from the fourth link's origin to the target.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Adjust target for the fifth link's Y offset
    y_adj = y_target - 0.093

    # Solve for the first three joints using the existing approach with adjusted y
    numerator = x_target**2 + y_adj**2 + z_target**2 - (0.425**2 + 0.39225**2)
    denominator = 2 * 0.425 * 0.39225
    cos_q3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)
    q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)

    A = 0.425 + 0.39225 * np.cos(q3)
    B = 0.39225 * np.sin(q3)
    S_squared = x_target**2 + y_adj**2 - 0.10915**2
    S = np.sqrt(S_squared) if S_squared >= 0 else 0.0
    C = z_target
    numerator_q2 = S * A - C * B
    denominator_q2 = S * B + C * A
    q2 = np.arctan2(numerator_q2, denominator_q2)
    phi = np.arctan2(0.10915, S) if S != 0 else np.pi / 2
    q1 = np.arctan2(y_adj, x_target) - phi
    q1 = (q1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi

    # Compute the position of the fourth link's origin using forward kinematics
    c1, s1 = np.cos(q1), np.sin(q1)
    c2, s2 = np.cos(q2), np.sin(q2)
    c3, s3 = np.cos(q3), np.sin(q3)

    # Transformation matrices
    # From base to link1 (rotation Z by q1)
    # Link1 to link2: translate (0, 0.13585, 0)
    # Link2 to link3: rotate Y by q2, then translate (0, -0.1197, 0.425)
    # Link3 to link4: rotate Y by q3, then translate (0, 0, 0.39225)
    x4 = c1*(s2*(s3*0.39225 + 0.425) + c2*(-0.1197)) + s1*0.13585
    y4 = s1*(s2*(s3*0.39225 + 0.425) + c2*(-0.1197)) - c1*0.13585
    z4 = c2*(s3*0.39225 + 0.425) - s2*(-0.1197)

    # Calculate delta_x and delta_z from fourth link origin to target
    delta_x = x_target - x4
    delta_z = z_target - z4

    # Solve for q4 using the delta_x and delta_z
    q4 = np.arctan2(delta_x, delta_z)
    q5 = 0.0  # q5 does not affect position

    return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Target Position**: The Y component of the target is adjusted by subtracting the fifth link's Y offset (0.093).
2. **Solve for q1, q2, q3**: Using the adjusted target, the existing solution computes the first three joint angles by solving the inverse kinematics for the first three links.
3. **Forward Kinematics for Fourth Link**: The position of the fourth link's origin is computed using the derived joint angles and forward kinematics equations.
4. **Determine q4**: The remaining X and Z offsets from the fourth link's origin to the target are used to compute the fourth joint angle (q4) using the arctangent function.
5. **Set q5**: The fifth joint angle (q5) is set to zero as it does not affect the position of the TCP.

This approach ensures that all joint angles are correctly computed to reach the target position, considering the kinematic chain up to the fifth link and the TCP's offset.
