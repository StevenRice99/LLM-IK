To solve this problem, we need to compute the inverse kinematics for a 5-DOF manipulator to reach a target position. The key challenge is correctly accounting for the TCP's offset and determining the fourth joint angle (q4) based on the adjusted target position.

### Approach
1. **Adjust Target Position**: Subtract the Y component of the fifth link's offset from the target's Y coordinate.
2. **Solve for First Three Joints**: Use the existing solution to compute the first three joint angles (q1, q2, q3) based on the adjusted Y component and the original X and Z components.
3. **Compute Fourth Link's Origin**: Use forward kinematics to determine the position of the fourth link's origin using the derived joint angles.
4. **Determine Fourth Joint Angle (q4)**: Calculate q4 based on the remaining X and Z offsets from the fourth link's origin to the target.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Adjust target for the fifth link's Y offset
    y_adj = y_target - 0.093

    # Solve for the first three joints using the existing approach with adjusted y
    numerator = x_target**2 + y_adj**2 + z_target**2 - (0.425**2 + 0.39225**2)
    denominator = 2 * 0.425 * 0.39225
    cos_q3 = numerator / denominator
    cos_q3 = np.clip(cos_q3, -1.0, 1.0)
    q3 = np.arccos(cos_q3)

    A = 0.425 + 0.39225 * np.cos(q3)
    B = 0.39225 * np.sin(q3)
    S_squared = x_target**2 + y_adj**2 - 0.10915**2
    S = np.sqrt(S_squared) if S_squared >= 0 else 0.0
    C = z_target
    numerator_q2 = S * A - C * B
    denominator_q2 = S * B + C * A
    q2 = np.arctan2(numerator_q2, denominator_q2)
    phi = np.arctan2(0.10915, S) if S != 0 else np.pi / 2
    q1 = np.arctan2(y_adj, x_target) - phi
    q1 = (q1 + np.pi) % (2 * np.pi) - np.pi

    # Compute the position of the fourth link's origin using corrected forward kinematics
    c1, s1 = np.cos(q1), np.sin(q1)
    c2, s2 = np.cos(q2), np.sin(q2)
    c3, s3 = np.cos(q3), np.sin(q3)

    # Compute x_after_q2 and z_after_q2
    x_after_q2 = s2 * (0.425 + 0.39225 * c3) + 0.39225 * s3 * c2
    z_after_q2 = c2 * (0.425 + 0.39225 * c3) - 0.39225 * s3 * s2

    # Compute link4's origin position
    x_link4 = x_after_q2 * c1 - 0.01615 * s1
    z_link4 = z_after_q2

    # Calculate delta_x and delta_z from fourth link origin to target
    delta_x = x_target - x_link4
    delta_z = z_target - z_link4

    # Solve for q4 using the delta_x and delta_z
    q4 = np.arctan2(delta_x, delta_z)
    q5 = 0.0  # Fifth joint does not affect position

    return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Adjust Target Position**: The Y component of the target is adjusted by subtracting the fifth link's Y offset (0.093) to account for its position relative to link4.
2. **Solve for q1, q2, q3**: Using the adjusted target, the existing solution computes the first three joint angles by solving the inverse kinematics for the first three links.
3. **Forward Kinematics for Fourth Link**: The position of the fourth link's origin is computed using the derived joint angles and the correct forward kinematics equations, ensuring accurate positioning.
4. **Determine q4**: The remaining X and Z offsets from the fourth link's origin to the target are used to compute the fourth joint angle (q4) using the arctangent function, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position.

This approach ensures that all joint angles are correctly computed to reach the target position, considering the kinematic chain up to the fifth link and the TCP's offset.
