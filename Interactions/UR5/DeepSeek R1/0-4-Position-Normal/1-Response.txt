To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 5-DOF manipulator, we determine the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target point (x, y, z). The solution involves calculating the base rotation (theta1) to align the arm in the target's direction and solving for the planar arm angles (theta2, theta3, theta4) to reach the target's radial and vertical distances. Theta5 is set to zero as it doesn't affect the position.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate theta1 to align with the target's x-y projection
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Position of Revolute 2's origin after theta1
    x1 = 0.13585 * np.sin(theta1)
    y1 = 0.13585 * np.cos(theta1)
    z1 = 0.0

    # Vector from Revolute 2 to target in the plane
    dx = x - x1
    dy = y - y1
    dz = z - z1
    r = np.hypot(dx, dy)
    z_planar = dz

    # Effective link lengths (Revolute 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 to TCP)
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = np.hypot(0.093, 0.09465)  # Combined effect of Revolute 4 to 5 and TCP

    # Target distance from Revolute 2
    d = np.hypot(r, z_planar)

    # Solve for theta2, theta3, theta4 using geometric approach
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2 - L3**2 - 2*L1*L3) / (2 * L2 * (L1 + L3))
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0))

    # Calculate intermediate angle for theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_planar, r)
    beta = np.arcsin((L2 * np.sin(theta3)) / d)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Theta4 compensates for the remaining angle to align TCP
    theta4 = - (theta2 + theta3)

    # Theta5 doesn't affect position, set to zero
    theta5 = 0.0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
