To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified position and orientation. The solution involves breaking down the problem into position and orientation components, leveraging existing sub-solutions, and computing the remaining joint angles.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**: Use geometric and trigonometric methods to determine the first four joint angles (theta1 to theta4) that position the end-effector at the desired coordinates. This involves adjusting for the tool center point (TCP) offset and solving using the law of cosines.
2. **Orientation Calculation**: Compute the rotation matrix from the target orientation (roll, pitch, yaw). Use the cumulative rotation from the first four joints to determine the remaining rotation needed, which is then used to find the fifth joint angle (theta5).

### Solution Code

    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Compute the target rotation matrix from roll, pitch, yaw (ZYX convention)
    cr, sr = math.cos(roll), math.sin(roll)

### Explanation
1. **Rotation Matrix Calculation**: The target orientation is converted into a rotation matrix using the provided roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
2. **Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted to account for the TCP offset, focusing on the position that the third link needs to reach.
3. **Geometric Solution for Joint Angles**: Using the law of cosines and inverse kinematics, the first three joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) are computed to position the arm correctly.
4. **Orientation Adjustment**: The remaining rotation needed after positioning is used to determine theta4 and theta5, ensuring the end-effector's orientation matches the target.

This approach efficiently combines geometric and algebraic methods to solve the inverse kinematics problem for a 5-DOF robotic arm, ensuring both position and orientation are achieved.
