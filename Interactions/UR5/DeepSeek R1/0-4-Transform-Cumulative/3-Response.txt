To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified position and orientation. The solution involves breaking down the problem into position and orientation components, leveraging geometric and trigonometric methods, and ensuring correct handling of the tool center point (TCP) offset.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**: 
   - Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset using the full target rotation matrix.
   - Solve for the first three joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) using a geometric approach to position the wrist (the point before the TCP).

2. **Orientation Calculation**: 
   - Compute the remaining joint angles (theta4 and theta5) to match the target orientation. Theta4 is derived from the Y-axis component of the target orientation, and theta5 is derived from the remaining Z-axis rotation.

### Solution Code

### Explanation
1. **Rotation Matrix Calculation**: The target orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) is converted into a rotation matrix using the ZYX Euler angles convention.
2. **Wrist Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset rotated by the target rotation matrix to get the wrist position.
3. **Theta1 Calculation**: The first joint angle (theta1) is determined using the x and y components of the wrist position.
4. **Geometric Solution for Theta2 and Theta3**: Using the law of cosines and inverse kinematics, the second and third joint angles are computed to position the wrist correctly.
5. **Theta4 Calculation**: The fourth joint angle (theta4) is derived from the remaining Y-axis rotation needed to match the target orientation.
6. **Theta5 Calculation**: The fifth joint angle (theta5) is determined from the remaining Z-axis rotation after accounting for all previous joints.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the end-effector are accurately achieved by considering the geometric configuration and rotational contributions of each joint.
