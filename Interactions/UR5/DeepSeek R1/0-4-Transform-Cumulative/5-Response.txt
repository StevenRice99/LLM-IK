To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified position and orientation. The solution involves breaking down the problem into position and orientation components, leveraging geometric and trigonometric methods, and ensuring correct handling of the tool center point (TCP) offset.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - Compute the target rotation matrix from the given roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
   - Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset using the target rotation matrix.
   - Solve for the first three joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) using a geometric approach to position the wrist (the point before the TCP).

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - Compute the remaining joint angles (theta4 and theta5) to match the target orientation. Theta4 is derived from the Y-axis component of the remaining rotation, and theta5 is derived from the Z-axis component.

### Explanation
1. **Rotation Matrix Calculation**: The target orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) is converted into a rotation matrix using the ZYX Euler angles convention.
2. **Wrist Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset rotated by the target rotation matrix to get the wrist position.
3. **Theta1 and Theta2 Calculation**: The first two joint angles are determined using a geometric approach based on the wrist position, ensuring the arm reaches the correct planar position.
4. **Theta3 Calculation**: The third joint angle is derived from the remaining Y-axis rotation needed to achieve the target orientation.
5. **Theta4 and Theta5 Calculation**: The remaining rotation is decomposed into Y and Z components to determine the fourth and fifth joint angles, ensuring the end-effector's orientation matches the target.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the end-effector are accurately achieved by considering the geometric configuration and rotational contributions of each joint.
