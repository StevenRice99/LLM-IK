To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified position and orientation. The solution involves both position and orientation components, leveraging geometric and trigonometric calculations.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - **Theta1 (Base Rotation)**: Calculate the angle to align the arm with the target's projection on the XY plane using `atan2`.
   - **Radial Distance**: Compute the radial distance from the base to the target's projection on the XY plane.
   - **3R Arm Inverse Kinematics**: Solve for the joint angles (theta2, theta3, theta4) using geometric methods to reach the target position in the XZ plane after accounting for the base rotation.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - **Theta5 (End Effector Rotation)**: Adjust the end effector's orientation using the remaining degree of freedom (theta5) to match the desired orientation after positioning.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, sqrt, acos, sin, cos

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Calculate theta1 to align with the target's projection on XY plane
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)
    r_proj = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

    # Link lengths (from Revolute2 to TCP)
    a2 = 0.425  # Revolute2 to Revolute3
    a3 = 0.39225  # Revolute3 to Revolute4
    a4 = 0.093 + 0.09465  # Revolute4 to Revolute5 and TCP

    # Solve for theta2, theta3, theta4 using geometric approach
    d = sqrt(r_proj**2 + z**2)
    if d > a2 + a3 + a4 or d < abs(a2 - a3 - a4):
        raise ValueError("Target position is unreachable")

    # Solve for theta3 (elbow-up and elbow-down solutions)
    cos_theta3 = (r_proj**2 + z**2 - a2**2 - (a3 + a4)**2) / (2 * a2 * (a3 + a4))
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = acos(cos_theta3)

    # Choose elbow-up solution
    theta3 = -theta3  # elbow-down

    # Solve for theta2
    gamma = atan2(z, r_proj)
    delta = atan2((a3 + a4) * sin(theta3), a2 + (a3 + a4) * cos(theta3))
    theta2 = gamma - delta

    # Adjust for the actual a3 and a4
    x_remaining = r_proj - a2 * cos(theta2) - a3 * cos(theta2 + theta3)
    z_remaining = z - a2 * sin(theta2) - a3 * sin(theta2 + theta3)
    theta4 = atan2(z_remaining, x_remaining) - (theta2 + theta3)

    # Compute rotation matrices up to joint4
    R1 = np.array([
        [cos(theta1), -sin(theta1), 0],
        [sin(theta1), cos(theta1), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    R2 = np.array([
        [cos(theta2), 0, sin(theta2)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-sin(theta2), 0, cos(theta2)]
    ])
    R3 = np.array([
        [cos(theta3), 0, sin(theta3)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-sin(theta3), 0, cos(theta3)]
    ])
    R4 = np.array([
        [cos(theta4), 0, sin(theta4)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-sin(theta4), 0, cos(theta4)]
    ])
    R_prev = R1 @ R2 @ R3 @ R4

    # Compute target rotation matrix from RPY (xyz)
    cr, sr = cos(roll), sin(roll)
    cp, sp = cos(pitch), sin(pitch)
    cy, sy = cos(yaw), sin(yaw)
    R_target = np.array([
        [cy * cp, cy * sp * sr - sy * cr, cy * sp * cr + sy * sr],
        [sy * cp, sy * sp * sr + cy * cr, sy * sp * cr - cy * sr],
        [-sp, cp * sr, cp * cr]
    ])

    # Solve for theta5
    R_z5 = R_prev.T @ R_target
    theta5 = atan2(R_z5[1, 0], R_z5[0, 0])

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation**: The base joint (theta1) is determined to align the arm with the target's projection on the XY plane using the arctangent function.
2. **Radial Distance**: The radial distance from the base to the target's projection helps in solving the 3R arm problem.
3. **3R Arm IK**: Using geometric methods, the joint angles (theta2, theta3, theta4) are computed to position the end effector at the target coordinates.
4. **Orientation Adjustment**: The rotation matrix up to the fourth joint is computed, and the fifth joint (theta5) is adjusted to match the desired orientation derived from the target RPY angles.

This approach ensures that the robotic arm reaches the desired position and orientation using closed-form inverse kinematics.
