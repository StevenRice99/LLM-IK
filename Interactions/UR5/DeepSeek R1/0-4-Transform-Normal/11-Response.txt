To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified position and orientation. The solution involves both position and orientation components, leveraging geometric and trigonometric calculations. The key corrections involve accurately calculating the link lengths based on the URDF specifications and adjusting the reachability check and joint angle calculations accordingly.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - **Theta1 (Base Rotation)**: Calculate the angle to align the arm with the target's projection on the XY plane using `atan2`.
   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the Euclidean distance from the second joint (Revolute 2) to the target position, considering the offset of Revolute 2 from the base.
   - **Reachability Check**: Ensure the target is within the arm's reach using the combined lengths of the links, corrected based on URDF specifications.
   - **Theta2 and Theta3 (Elbow Joints)**: Use geometric relationships and the law of cosines with corrected link lengths to determine the angles for the elbow joints.
   - **Theta4 (Wrist Adjustment)**: Adjust the wrist joint to align the end effector.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - **Theta5 (End Effector Rotation)**: Adjust the end effector's orientation using the remaining degree of freedom (theta5) to match the desired orientation after positioning.

### Explanation
1. **Correct Link Lengths**: The link lengths (a2, a3, a4) are calculated based on the URDF specifications using Euclidean distances between consecutive joints, ensuring accurate kinematic modeling.
2. **Reachability Check**: The target's distance from Revolute2 is computed considering its offset and checked against the valid range using corrected link lengths.
3. **Joint Angles Calculation**: Theta2 and Theta3 are determined using geometric relationships and the law of cosines with the corrected link lengths. Theta4 is adjusted to align the end effector, and Theta5 is computed to match the desired orientation using rotation matrices.

This approach ensures the robotic arm accurately reaches the target position and orientation by correctly accounting for spatial relationships and link lengths as specified in the URDF.
