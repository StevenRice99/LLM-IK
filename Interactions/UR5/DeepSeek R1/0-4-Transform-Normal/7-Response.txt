To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified position and orientation. The solution involves both position and orientation components, leveraging geometric and trigonometric calculations.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - **Theta1 (Base Rotation)**: Calculate the angle to align the arm with the target's projection on the XY plane using `atan2`.
   - **Distance Calculation**: Compute the Euclidean distance from the second joint (Revolute 2) to the target position, considering the offset of Revolute 2 from the base.
   - **Reachability Check**: Ensure the target is within the arm's reach using the combined lengths of the links.
   - **Theta2 and Theta3 (Elbow Joints)**: Use geometric relationships and the law of cosines to determine the angles for the elbow joints.
   - **Theta4 (Wrist Adjustment)**: Adjust the wrist joint to align the end effector.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - **Theta5 (End Effector Rotation)**: Adjust the end effector's orientation using the remaining degree of freedom (theta5) to match the desired orientation after positioning.

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Calculate theta1 to align with target's projection on XY plane
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)

    # Corrected kinematic parameters
    a2 = 0.425               # Revolute2 to Revolute3
    a3 = 0.39225             # Revolute3 to Revolute4
    a4 = sqrt(0.093**2 + 0.09465**2)  # Revolute4 to TCP

    # Calculate distance from Revolute2 (0, 0.13585, 0) to target (x, y, z)
    dx = x
    dy = y - 0.13585  # Account for Revolute2's Y offset
    dz = z
    d = sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)

    # Reachability check
    if not (abs(a2 - (a3 + a4)) <= d <= (a2 + a3 + a4)):
        raise ValueError("Target position is unreachable")

    # Solve for theta3 using law of cosines (elbow-down)
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - a2**2 - (a3 + a4)**2) / (2 * a2 * (a3 + a4))
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = -acos(cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2 using geometric relationships
    gamma = atan2(dz, sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2))  # Vertical angle to target
    delta = acos((a2**2 + d**2 - (a3 + a4)**2) / (2 * a2 * d))
    theta2 = gamma - delta

    # Calculate theta4 to align the end effector
    theta4 = - (theta2 + theta3)

    # Compute rotation matrices up to joint4
    R1 = np.array([[cos(theta1), -sin(theta1), 0],
                   [sin(theta1), cos(theta1), 0],
                   [0, 0, 1]])

                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-sin(theta2), 0, cos(theta2)]])
    R3 = np.array([[cos(theta3), 0, sin(theta3)],
                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-sin(theta3), 0, cos(theta3)]])
    R4 = np.array([[cos(theta4), 0, sin(theta4)],
                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-sin(theta4), 0, cos(theta4)]])
    R_combined = R1 @ R2 @ R3 @ R4

    # Calculate final rotation for theta5
    cr, sr = cos(roll), sin(roll)
    cp, sp = cos(pitch), sin(pitch)
    cy, sy = cos(yaw), sin(yaw)

        [sy*cp, sy*sp*sr + cy*cr, sy*sp*cr - cy*sr],
        [-sp, cp*sr, cp*cr]
    ])
    R_diff = R_combined.T @ R_target

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation**: The base joint (theta1) is determined to align the arm with the target's projection on the XY plane using the arctangent function.
2. **Distance Calculation**: The Euclidean distance from Revolute 2 to the target is computed, considering the offset of Revolute 2 from the base.
3. **Reachability Check**: Ensures the target is within the arm's reach using the combined lengths of the links.
4. **Theta2 and Theta3**: Using geometric methods and the law of cosines, the joint angles are computed to position the end effector at the target coordinates.
5. **Theta4**: Adjusts the wrist joint to maintain orientation continuity.
6. **Orientation Adjustment**: The rotation matrix up to the fourth joint is computed, and the fifth joint (theta5) is adjusted to match the desired orientation derived from the target RPY angles.

This approach ensures that the robotic arm reaches the desired position and orientation using closed-form inverse kinematics, correctly accounting for the spatial relationships and link lengths.
