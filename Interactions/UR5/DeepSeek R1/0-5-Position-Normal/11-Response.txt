To solve this problem, we need to compute the inverse kinematics for a 6-DOF robotic arm to reach a target position while maintaining a fixed orientation. The solution involves calculating the joint angles for the first three joints to position the wrist center and then determining the last three joints to achieve the desired orientation.

### Approach
1. **Wrist Center Calculation**: Determine the wrist center position by subtracting the known offset from the target position. This offset is derived from the robot's forward kinematics when all joints are at zero.
2. **First Three Joints (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃)**:
   - **θ₁**: Calculate using the arctangent of the wrist center's x and y coordinates.
   - **θ₂ and θ₃**: Use geometric and trigonometric relationships to position the wrist center relative to the robot's base, considering the link lengths and possible configurations (elbow-up and elbow-down).
3. **Last Three Joints (θ₄, θ₅, θ₆)**: Compute the required rotations to maintain the fixed orientation of the end-effector using rotation matrix decomposition based on the first three joint angles.

### Explanation
1. **Wrist Center Calculation**: The target position is adjusted by subtracting the wrist offset to find the wrist center position.
2. **θ₁ Calculation**: The first joint angle is determined using the arctangent of the wrist center's x and y coordinates, considering both primary and alternate solutions.
3. **θ₂ and θ₃ Calculation**: Using the law of cosines and geometric relationships, the angles for the second and third joints are computed, considering both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations.
4. **Orientation Handling**: The rotation matrix from the base to the wrist center is computed, and the required rotation for the last three joints is derived to maintain the fixed orientation. This involves decomposing the rotation matrix into Euler angles corresponding to the joint axes (Y-Z-Y).
5. **Validation**: Solutions are checked for joint limits, and the first valid configuration is returned. If no valid configuration is found, a fallback solution is provided.

This approach ensures that the robot reaches the target position while maintaining the desired orientation through proper handling of both positional and rotational components.
