To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 2-DOF serial manipulator such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves using geometric relationships and trigonometric functions to derive the joint angles.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The position and orientation of the TCP are determined by the combined rotations of these joints. The orientation of the TCP is directly related to the sum of the joint angles (theta1 and theta2), while the position is determined by the trigonometric relationships involving these angles.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The Y-component of the TCP's position is fixed due to the structure of the robot.
   - The orientation's Y-component (pitch) is the sum of the two joint angles.
   - The X and Z components of the TCP's position can be expressed using sine and cosine functions of the joint angles.

3. **Formulation**:
   - Using the target orientation, we determine the sum of the joint angles (theta_sum).
   - Using trigonometric identities and the target position, we solve for the individual joint angles (theta1 and theta2).

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    theta_sum = r[1]  # Orientation's Y component is the sum of theta1 and theta2

    S = math.sin(theta_sum)
    C = math.cos(theta_sum)

    # Calculate the terms for theta1
    term_x = x_target - 0.39225 * S
    term_z = z_target - 0.39225 * C

    # Compute theta1 using atan2
    theta1 = math.atan2(term_x / 0.425, term_z / 0.425)

    # Compute theta2
    theta2 = theta_sum - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Handling**: The target orientation's Y-component (r[1]) is the sum of the two joint angles (theta1 + theta2). This is because both joints rotate around the Y-axis, and their rotations are cumulative.

2. **Position Handling**:
   - The X and Z components of the target position are adjusted by the contributions from the second joint's rotation (theta_sum).
   - These adjusted values are then used to solve for theta1 using the arctangent function, considering the geometric configuration of the first link.

3. **Trigonometric Relationships**:
   - The terms `term_x` and `term_z` adjust the target position by the contribution from the second link's rotation.
   - These terms are scaled by the length of the first link (0.425) to isolate the trigonometric functions of theta1, allowing the use of `atan2` to determine theta1 accurately.

This approach efficiently computes the joint angles using geometric and trigonometric principles, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation.
