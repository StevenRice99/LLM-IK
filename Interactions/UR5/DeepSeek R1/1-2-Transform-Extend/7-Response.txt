To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 2-DOF serial manipulator such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves using geometric relationships and trigonometric functions to derive the joint angles, considering both position and orientation constraints.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The position and orientation of the TCP are determined by the combined rotations of these joints. The orientation of the TCP is directly related to the sum of the joint angles (theta1 and theta2), while the position is determined by trigonometric relationships involving these angles.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The Y-component of the TCP's position is fixed due to the structure of the robot.
   - The orientation's Y-component (pitch) is the sum of the two joint angles.
   - The X and Z components of the TCP's position can be expressed using sine and cosine functions of the joint angles.

3. **Formulation**:
   - Using the target orientation, we determine the sum of the joint angles (theta_sum).
   - Using trigonometric identities and the target position, we solve for the individual joint angles (theta1 and theta2) using the law of cosines and inverse trigonometric functions.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    theta_sum = r[1]  # Target orientation's Y component (pitch)
    
    a = 0.425  # Length of the first link (Revolute 1 to Revolute 2)
    b = 0.39225  # Length of the second link (Revolute 2 to TCP)
    
    d_sq = x_target**2 + z_target**2
    d = math.sqrt(d_sq)
    
    # Calculate possible theta2 values using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to avoid numerical errors
    theta2_1 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_2 = -theta2_1
    
    solutions = []
    for theta2 in [theta2_1, theta2_2]:
        # Calculate theta1 based on theta_sum
        theta1 = theta_sum - theta2
        
        # Verify the position using forward kinematics
        x_calc = a * math.sin(theta1) + b * math.sin(theta_sum)
        z_calc = a * math.cos(theta1) + b * math.cos(theta_sum)
        
        if (math.isclose(x_calc, x_target, abs_tol=1e-5) and
            math.isclose(z_calc, z_target, abs_tol=1e-5)):
            solutions.append((theta1, theta2))
    
    # Select the valid solution
    if solutions:
        # Prefer the solution where theta2 is within the joint limits
        for theta1, theta2 in solutions:
            if -6.2831853 <= theta2 <= 6.2831853:
                return (theta1, theta2)
        return solutions[0]
    else:
        # Fallback in case no solution is found (should not occur as per problem statement)
        theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
        theta2 = theta_sum - theta1
        return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Handling**: The target orientation's Y-component (r[1]) is used as the sum of the joint angles (theta_sum). This is because both joints rotate around the Y-axis, and their rotations are cumulative.

2. **Position Handling**:
   - The X and Z components of the target position are used to compute the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane.
   - The law of cosines is applied to determine the possible values for the second joint angle (theta2).

3. **Trigonometric Relationships**:
   - The cosine of theta2 is computed using the law of cosines, considering the lengths of the links and the distance to the target.
   - Two possible solutions for theta2 (positive and negative) are considered, and the correct one is selected based on the position equations and joint limits.

This approach efficiently computes the joint angles using geometric and trigonometric principles, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation while adhering to the constraints provided.
