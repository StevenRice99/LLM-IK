To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 2-DOF serial manipulator such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves converting the target orientation into a rotation matrix to accurately extract the Y-axis rotation, which is then used to compute the joint angles.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The position and orientation of the TCP are determined by the combined rotations of these joints. The orientation of the TCP is derived from the target's rotation matrix, which is converted from the given RPY (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) angles.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The Y-component of the TCP's position is fixed due to the robot's structure.
   - The orientation's Y-axis rotation (pitch) is extracted from the target's rotation matrix, which accounts for possible equivalent rotations represented by non-zero roll and yaw components in the RPY angles.

3. **Formulation**:
   - Convert the target RPY angles into a rotation matrix.
   - Extract the Y-axis rotation (theta_sum) from this matrix.
   - Use trigonometric identities and the target position to solve for the individual joint angles (theta1 and theta2) using the law of cosines and inverse trigonometric functions.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Compute the rotation matrix elements from RPY angles (XYZ order)
    cx = math.cos(rx)
    sx = math.sin(rx)
    cy = math.cos(ry)
    sy = math.sin(ry)
    cz = math.cos(rz)
    sz = math.sin(rz)

    # Calculate R[0,0] and R[0,2] of the rotation matrix
    R00 = cy * cz
    R02 = sy

    # Extract the equivalent Y rotation angle from the rotation matrix
    theta_sum = math.atan2(R02, R00)

    a = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    b = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    d_sq = x_target**2 + z_target**2
    d = math.sqrt(d_sq)

    # Calculate possible theta2 values using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to avoid numerical errors
    theta2_1 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_2 = -theta2_1

    solutions = []
    for theta2 in [theta2_1, theta2_2]:
        theta1 = theta_sum - theta2

        # Verify the position using forward kinematics
        x_calc = a * math.sin(theta1) + b * math.sin(theta_sum)
        z_calc = a * math.cos(theta1) + b * math.cos(theta_sum)

        if (math.isclose(x_calc, x_target, abs_tol=1e-5) and
            math.isclose(z_calc, z_target, abs_tol=1e-5)):
            solutions.append((theta1, theta2))

    if solutions:
        # Prefer the solution where theta2 is within the joint limits
        for theta1, theta2 in solutions:
            if -6.2831853 <= theta2 <= 6.2831853:
                return (theta1, theta2)
        return solutions[0]
    else:
        # Fallback in case no solution is found (should not occur as per problem statement)
        term_x = x_target - b * math.sin(theta_sum)
        term_z = z_target - b * math.cos(theta_sum)
        theta1 = math.atan2(term_x, term_z)
        theta2 = theta_sum - theta1
        return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Handling**: The target orientation's RPY angles are converted into a rotation matrix. The Y-axis rotation (theta_sum) is extracted from this matrix using `atan2`, ensuring that equivalent rotations (even with non-zero roll and yaw) are correctly interpreted as a single Y-axis rotation.

2. **Position Handling**:
   - The X and Z components of the target position are used to compute the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane.
   - The law of cosines is applied to determine possible values for the second joint angle (theta2).

3. **Trigonometric Relationships**:
   - The cosine of theta2 is computed using the law of cosines, considering the lengths of the links and the distance to the target.
   - Two possible solutions for theta2 (positive and negative) are considered, and the correct one is selected based on the position equations and joint limits.

This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation by accurately accounting for the target's rotation matrix and solving the inverse kinematics problem using geometric and trigonometric principles.
