To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (q1 and q2) for a 2-DOF serial manipulator that will position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position and orientation. The solution involves using inverse kinematics based on the geometric configuration of the robot.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP's position is derived from the forward kinematics of these joints. The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles (q1 + q2) around the Y-axis.
2. **Key Equations**:
   - **Position Equations**: Derived from the forward kinematics, the TCP's position (x, z) in the XZ-plane is a function of the joint angles q1 and q2.
   - **Orientation Equation**: The desired orientation's pitch component (r[1]) must equal the sum of the joint angles (q1 + q2).
3. **Closed-Form Solution**: By substituting the orientation constraint into the position equations, we can solve for q1 and q2 using trigonometric identities and the arctangent function.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    theta = r[1]
    a = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 2 to TCP
    b = 0.425    # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    x_p = p[0]
    z_p = p[2]
    
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
    
    numerator_x = x_p - a * sin_theta
    numerator_z = z_p - a * cos_theta
    
    q1 = math.atan2(numerator_x / b, numerator_z / b)
    q2 = theta - q1
    
    return (q1, q2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Constraint**: The desired pitch angle (theta) is given by the orientation parameter `r[1]`. This angle is the sum of the joint angles q1 and q2.
2. **Position Equations**: The target position (x_p, z_p) is used to derive the joint angles. By substituting the orientation constraint into the position equations, we reduce the problem to solving for q1 using trigonometric functions.
3. **Trigonometric Solution**: Using the arctangent function, we compute q1 from the adjusted target position components. The second joint angle q2 is then derived from the orientation constraint.

This approach efficiently computes the joint angles using closed-form solutions, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation.
