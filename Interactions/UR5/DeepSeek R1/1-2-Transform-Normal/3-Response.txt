To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (q1 and q2) for a 2-DOF serial manipulator that will position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position and orientation. The solution involves using inverse kinematics based on the geometric configuration of the robot, considering both possible solutions for the joint angles and selecting the appropriate one based on the target position.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP's position is derived from the forward kinematics of these joints. The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles (q1 + q2) around the Y-axis.
2. **Key Equations**:
   - **Position Equations**: Derived from the forward kinematics, the TCP's position (x, z) in the XZ-plane is a function of the joint angles q1 and q2.
   - **Orientation Equation**: The desired orientation's pitch component (r[1]) must equal the sum of the joint angles (q1 + q2).
3. **Closed-Form Solution**: By substituting the orientation constraint into the position equations, we can solve for q1 using trigonometric identities and the arctangent function. We then adjust the solution to ensure the joint angles are within the correct range.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    theta = r[1]
    a = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 2 to TCP
    b = 0.425    # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    x_p, y_p, z_p = p
    
    A = x_p - a * math.sin(theta)
    B = z_p - a * math.cos(theta)
    
    q1 = math.atan2(A, B)
    
    # Adjust q1 to be within [0, 2π) if negative
    if q1 < 0:
        q1 += 2 * math.pi
    
    q2 = theta - q1
    
    # Adjust q2 to be within [-π, π) to handle wrap-around
    q2 = (q2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    
    return (q1, q2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Constraint**: The desired pitch angle (theta) is given by the orientation parameter `r[1]`. This angle is the sum of the joint angles q1 and q2.
2. **Position Equations**: The target position (x_p, z_p) is used to derive the joint angles. By substituting the orientation constraint into the position equations, we reduce the problem to solving for q1 using trigonometric functions.
3. **Trigonometric Solution**: Using the arctangent function, we compute q1 from the adjusted target position components. The second joint angle q2 is then derived from the orientation constraint.
4. **Angle Adjustment**: The solution adjusts q1 to be within the range [0, 2π) if it is negative and adjusts q2 to handle wrap-around within the range [-π, π). This ensures the joint angles are within the valid range and correctly positioned to reach the target.
