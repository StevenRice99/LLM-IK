To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (q1 and q2) for a 2-DOF serial manipulator that will position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position and orientation. The solution involves using inverse kinematics based on the geometric configuration of the robot, considering both possible solutions for the joint angles and selecting the appropriate one based on the target position and orientation.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The robot has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP's position is derived from the forward kinematics of these joints. The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles (q1 + q2) around the Y-axis.
2. **Key Equations**:
   - **Position Equations**: Derived from the forward kinematics, the TCP's position (x, z) in the XZ-plane is a function of the joint angles q1 and q2.
   - **Orientation Equation**: The desired orientation's pitch component (r[1]) must equal the sum of the joint angles (q1 + q2).
3. **Closed-Form Solution**: By using the law of cosines to solve for q2 based on the target position and then computing q1 using the orientation constraint, we ensure the correct solution is selected.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    theta = r[1]
    a = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 2 to TCP
    b = 0.425    # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    x_p, y_p, z_p = p

    # Calculate the squared distance from base to target
    d_sq = x_p**2 + z_p**2
    # Compute cos(q2) using the law of cosines
    numerator = d_sq - a**2 - b**2
    denominator = 2 * a * b
    cos_q2 = numerator / denominator
    cos_q2 = max(min(cos_q2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range

    # Two possible solutions for q2
    q2_1 = math.acos(cos_q2)
    q2_2 = -q2_1

    # Compute corresponding q1 for each solution
    q1_1 = theta - q2_1
    q1_2 = theta - q2_2

    # Check which solution matches the position
    def compute_error(q1, q2):
        x = b * math.sin(q1) + a * math.sin(q1 + q2)
        z = b * math.cos(q1) + a * math.cos(q1 + q2)
        return (x - x_p)**2 + (z - z_p)**2

    error1 = compute_error(q1_1, q2_1)
    error2 = compute_error(q1_2, q2_2)

    # Select the solution with the smallest error
    if error1 < error2:
        q1, q2 = q1_1, q2_1
    else:
        q1, q2 = q1_2, q2_2

    # Normalize angles to [-π, π)
    q1 = (q1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    q2 = (q2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi

    return (q1, q2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Constraint**: The desired pitch angle (theta) is given by the orientation parameter `r[1]`. This angle is the sum of the joint angles q1 and q2.
2. **Position Equations**: Using the law of cosines, we compute the possible values for q2 based on the target position. This allows us to handle both possible solutions (elbow up and elbow down).
3. **Solution Selection**: By evaluating both possible solutions for q2 and their corresponding q1 values, we select the pair that minimizes the error in reaching the target position. This ensures the correct solution is chosen even when multiple valid solutions exist.
4. **Angle Normalization**: The joint angles are normalized to the range [-π, π) to ensure they are within the valid joint limits.
