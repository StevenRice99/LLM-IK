To solve this problem, we need to compute the inverse kinematics for a 3-DOF serial manipulator to reach a target position (x, y, z) with the given structure. The solution involves extending an existing 2-DOF solution to include the third joint, considering the fixed Y-component of the TCP due to the robot's structure.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Robot Structure**: The robot consists of three revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis. The TCP's Y-component is fixed due to the cumulative Y-offsets from the links.
2. **Existing 2-DOF Solution**: The provided code solves the inverse kinematics for the first two joints (theta1 and theta2) to reach a target in the X-Z plane.
3. **Third Joint Handling**: The third joint (theta3) does not affect the TCP's position but is required to form a valid 3-DOF solution. We set theta3 to zero as it does not influence the position.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - l1 ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using geometric relationships
    beta = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    alpha = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = beta - alpha
    
    # The third joint does not affect the TCP position, so set to 0
    theta3 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Target Position Handling**: The target position (x, y, z) is decomposed into x and z components to compute the radial distance (r) in the X-Z plane.
2. **Theta2 Calculation**: Using the law of cosines, we compute the angle theta2 for the second joint.
3. **Theta1 Calculation**: Using geometric relationships (atan2 for angles), we determine theta1 for the first joint.
4. **Theta3 Handling**: The third joint's angle (theta3) is set to zero since it does not affect the TCP's position, ensuring the solution meets the 3-DOF requirement.

This approach efficiently extends the existing 2-DOF solution to include the third joint, providing a valid inverse kinematics solution for the given robot structure.
