To address the issues in the feedback, we need to ensure that the solution accounts for the correct orientation by considering the 2π periodicity of joint angles and selecting the appropriate solution that satisfies both position and orientation constraints.

### Approach
1. **Elbow-up and Elbow-down Solutions**: Calculate both possible configurations for theta2 (elbow-up and elbow-down) to explore all geometric possibilities.
2. **Theta1 Calculation**: Solve for theta1 using trigonometric identities derived from the forward kinematics equations, ensuring the correct quadrant is selected.
3. **Theta3 Adjustment**: Compute theta3 for each solution and adjust it by ±2π to find the angle within the joint limits that matches the target orientation.
4. **Solution Selection**: Evaluate all possible solutions (elbow-up and elbow-down with adjusted theta3) to find the one that satisfies both position and orientation constraints.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    r_y = r[1]  # Target orientation around Y (sum of thetas)
    
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    d_sq = x_target**2 + z_target**2
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0))  # Elbow-up
    theta2_alt = -theta2  # Elbow-down
    
    solutions = []
    for t2 in [theta2, theta2_alt]:
        C = L1 + L2 * np.cos(t2)
        D = L2 * np.sin(t2)
        denom = C**2 + D**2
        if denom < 1e-6:
            continue  # Avoid division by zero
        
        sin_t1 = (C * x_target - D * z_target) / denom
        cos_t1 = (D * x_target + C * z_target) / denom
        t1 = np.arctan2(sin_t1, cos_t1)
        
        # Calculate theta3 and adjust for 2π periodicity
        t3_unadjusted = r_y - t1 - t2
        # Adjust t3 to be within [-2π, 2π]
        t3 = t3_unadjusted % (2 * np.pi)
        if t3 > np.pi:
            t3 -= 2 * np.pi
        elif t3 < -np.pi:
            t3 += 2 * np.pi
        
        solutions.append((t1, t2, t3))
        
        # Also consider adding/subtracting 2π to t3 for another possible solution
        t3_alt = t3_unadjusted - 2 * np.pi
        if t3_alt >= -2 * np.pi and t3_alt <= 2 * np.pi:
            solutions.append((t1, t2, t3_alt))
        t3_alt = t3_unadjusted + 2 * np.pi
        if t3_alt >= -2 * np.pi and t3_alt <= 2 * np.pi:
            solutions.append((t1, t2, t3_alt))
    
    # Check all solutions for validity and best fit
    best_error = float('inf')
    best_sol = None
    for sol in solutions:
        t1, t2, t3 = sol
        # Check joint limits
        if not (-2*np.pi <= t1 <= 2*np.pi and -2*np.pi <= t2 <= 2*np.pi and -2*np.pi <= t3 <= 2*np.pi):
            continue
        # Forward kinematics check
        x = L1 * np.sin(t1) + L2 * np.sin(t1 + t2)
        z = L1 * np.cos(t1) + L2 * np.cos(t1 + t2)
        pos_error = np.hypot(x - x_target, z - z_target)
        orient_error = abs((t1 + t2 + t3) - r_y) % (2 * np.pi)
        orient_error = min(orient_error, 2 * np.pi - orient_error)
        total_error = pos_error + orient_error
        if total_error < best_error:
            best_error = total_error
            best_sol = sol
    
    return best_sol if best_sol is not None else (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)
```

### Explanation
1. **Multiple Solutions**: The code generates both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations and adjusts theta3 by ±2π to explore all valid solutions within the joint limits.
2. **Error Minimization**: Each solution is evaluated based on position and orientation errors, selecting the one that minimizes the total error.
3. **Joint Limits**: Solutions are filtered to ensure they fall within the specified joint limits, ensuring physical feasibility.
4. **Orientation Adjustment**: Theta3 is adjusted to wrap around the 2π period, ensuring the correct orientation is achieved even when exceeding ±π.

This approach comprehensively explores all possible solutions, ensuring the correct joint angles are selected to meet both position and orientation targets.
