To fix the domain error in the inverse kinematics calculation, we need to correctly adjust the target position by accounting for the TCP's offset and ensure the argument to `math.acos` remains within the valid range. Here's the revised solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Fixed TCP offset components from Revolute3 to TCP
    offset_xz = 0.18765  # Combined X-Z offset (0.093 + 0.09465)
    
    # Adjust target to account for TCP offset in X-Z plane
    d_target = math.hypot(x_target, z_target)
    if d_target == 0:
        x_adj, z_adj = 0.0, 0.0
    else:
        scale = offset_xz / d_target
        x_adj = x_target - x_target * scale
        z_adj = z_target - z_target * scale
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using adjusted X-Z target
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.hypot(x_adj, z_adj)
    
    # Ensure the argument to acos is within valid range
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Determine theta2 sign using cross product
    cross = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3 to align TCP offset with target direction
    theta_total = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    theta3 = theta_total - (theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Theta4 doesn't affect position; set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

**Key Fixes:**
1. **TCP Offset Adjustment:** The target position is adjusted by subtracting the TCP's X-Z offset in the direction of the original target vector. This ensures the adjusted position (`x_adj`, `z_adj`) is within the reachable workspace of the first two links.
2. **Clamping `cos_theta2`:** Ensures the argument to `math.acos` stays within [-1, 1], preventing domain errors.
3. **Theta3 Calculation:** Computes the third joint angle to align the TCP's offset with the target direction after solving for the first two joints.
