To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4) for a 4-DOF robotic arm to position its end-effector (TCP) at a given target position (x, y, z). The solution involves leveraging existing code snippets and understanding the kinematic chain of the robot.

### Approach
1. **Compute theta4 from the Y-coordinate**: The Y-coordinate of the TCP is influenced by the fourth joint (theta4). Using the given Y-coordinate, we can directly compute theta4 using the inverse sine function.
2. **Use existing code for the remaining joints**: The existing code snippet (Existing code 2) solves the inverse kinematics for a 3-joint planar arm. We use this code to compute the angles theta1, theta2, and theta3 based on the X and Z coordinates of the target position.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Calculate theta4 from the y-coordinate
    y_adjusted = y_target + 0.0267  # Adjusting for the fixed offset in y
    sin_theta4 = y_adjusted / 0.09465
    sin_theta4 = max(min(sin_theta4, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamping to valid range
    theta4 = math.asin(sin_theta4)
    
    # Using existing code 2 to solve for theta1, theta2, theta3 based on x and z
    # Existing code 2 uses x and z from the input, ignoring y
    a = 0.39225
    b = 0.09465
    d_sq = x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a ** 2 - b ** 2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    gamma = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    delta = math.atan2(b * math.sin(theta2), a + b * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = gamma - delta
    theta3 = 0.0  # As per existing code 2, theta3 is set to 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta4 Calculation**: The fourth joint (theta4) is determined by adjusting the target Y-coordinate to account for a fixed offset and then using the inverse sine function. This adjustment ensures the TCP's Y-coordinate matches the target.
2. **Existing Code Utilization**: The existing code snippet (Existing code 2) is used to solve for the first three joints (theta1, theta2, theta3). This code treats the problem as a planar inverse kinematics problem in the X-Z plane, ignoring the Y-coordinate which is already handled by theta4. The solution involves geometric calculations using the law of cosines and arctangent functions to determine the joint angles.

This approach efficiently combines direct computation for the fourth joint with existing solutions for the planar positioning of the first three joints, ensuring the robotic arm reaches the desired target position.
