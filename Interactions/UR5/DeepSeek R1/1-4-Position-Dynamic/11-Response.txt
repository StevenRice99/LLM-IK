To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4) for a 4-DOF robotic arm to position its end-effector (TCP) at a given target position (x, y, z). The solution involves decomposing the problem into two parts: positioning the first two joints to reach an intermediate target and adjusting the third joint to reach the exact target.

### Approach
1. **Adjust Target for Third Link**: Compute an intermediate target position (x', z') by subtracting the contribution of the third link (0.18765 units) in the direction of the target. This intermediate target represents the position of the third joint (Revolute 3).
2. **Solve Two-Link Inverse Kinematics**: Use the intermediate target to solve for the first two joint angles (theta1 and theta2) using a two-link inverse kinematics solution, considering both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations.
3. **Calculate Third Joint Angle**: Determine the angle needed for the third joint (theta3) to align the third link from the intermediate position to the actual target. This is done by computing the difference between the target direction and the cumulative angles of the first two joints.
4. **Select Optimal Configuration**: Choose the solution (elbow-up or elbow-down) that minimizes the absolute value of theta3 to ensure the closest alignment with the target.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    a = 0.425       # Length of the first link (Revolute 1 to Revolute 2)
    b = 0.39225     # Length of the second link (Revolute 2 to Revolute 3)
    c = 0.18765     # Combined length of Revolute 3 to Revolute 4 and TCP
    
    # Calculate the direction to the target
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    D = math.hypot(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Adjust target by c in the direction of phi to get intermediate target
    x_prime = x_target - c * math.sin(phi)
    z_prime = z_target - c * math.cos(phi)
    
    # Solve two-link inverse kinematics for the adjusted target
    dx = x_prime
    dz = z_prime
    d_sq = dx ** 2 + dz ** 2
    
    # Check if the adjusted target is reachable
    if d_sq > (a + b)**2 or d_sq < (a - b)**2:
        # Target is unreachable, but per problem statement, assume it's reachable
        # Proceed with clamped values
        pass
    
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2_pos = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_neg = -theta2_pos
    
    gamma = math.atan2(dx, dz)
    
    # Elbow-up solution
    delta_pos = math.atan2(b * math.sin(theta2_pos), a + b * math.cos(theta2_pos))
    theta1_pos = gamma - delta_pos
    theta3_pos = phi - (theta1_pos + theta2_pos)
    
    # Elbow-down solution
    delta_neg = math.atan2(b * math.sin(theta2_neg), a + b * math.cos(theta2_neg))
    theta1_neg = gamma - delta_neg
    theta3_neg = phi - (theta1_neg + theta2_neg)
    
    # Select the solution with minimal absolute theta3
    if abs(theta3_pos) <= abs(theta3_neg):
        theta1, theta2, theta3 = theta1_pos, theta2_pos, theta3_pos
    else:
        theta1, theta2, theta3 = theta1_neg, theta2_neg, theta3_neg
    
    # Normalize angles to [-pi, pi]
    theta1 = (theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    theta2 = (theta2 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    theta3 = (theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    
    # Theta4 is 0 as per the test cases
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Intermediate Target Calculation**: The intermediate target (x', z') is computed by moving a fixed distance (c) away from the actual target along the line connecting the base to the target. This adjustment ensures that the third link can reach the target from the intermediate position.
2. **Two-Link Inverse Kinematics**: The first two joint angles (theta1 and theta2) are determined using the intermediate target. This involves solving a two-link inverse kinematics problem using geometric methods (Law of Cosines and Arctangent functions), considering both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations.
3. **Third Joint Adjustment**: The third joint angle (theta3) is calculated as the difference between the target direction (phi) and the cumulative angles of the first two joints. This ensures the third link aligns with the target.
4. **Optimal Configuration Selection**: The solution (elbow-up or elbow-down) that results in the smallest absolute value of theta3 is chosen to ensure the closest alignment with the target, improving accuracy.

This approach efficiently combines geometric calculations and inverse kinematics principles to solve the problem for a 4-DOF robotic arm, ensuring the end-effector reaches the desired target position.
