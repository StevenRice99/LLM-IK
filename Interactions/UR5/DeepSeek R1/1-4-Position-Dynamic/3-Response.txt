To resolve the math domain error, the calculation of the adjusted target position (A, B) must correctly subtract the position of joint2. Additionally, the lengths L1 and L2 should account for all relevant link lengths from joint2 to the TCP. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the direction in x-z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Compute the adjusted target for the two-link system (theta2 and theta3)
    # Corrected by subtracting joint2's position
    joint2_x = 0.425 * math.sin(theta1)
    joint2_z = 0.425 * math.cos(theta1)
    A = x_target - joint2_x
    B = z_target - joint2_z
    
    # Include the 0.093 from joint3 to joint4 and 0.09465 from joint4 to TCP in the lengths
    L1 = 0.39225  # Joint2 to joint3
    L2 = math.sqrt(0.093**2 + 0.09465**2)  # Combined effect of joint3 to joint4 and TCP
    
    # Calculate the numerator and denominator for theta3
    numerator = A**2 + B**2 - L1**2 - L2**2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * L2
    cos_theta3 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within valid range due to possible floating point errors
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using adjusted terms
    A_term = L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)
    B_term = L2 * math.sin(theta3)
    denominator_theta2 = A_term**2 + B_term**2
    sin_theta2 = (A_term * A - B_term * B) / denominator_theta2
    cos_theta2 = (B_term * A + A_term * B) / denominator_theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    # Theta4 does not affect the position, set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

**Key Corrections:**
1. **Adjusted Target Calculation:** Subtracted joint2's position from the target to get the correct vector from joint2 to the target.
2. **Length Adjustment:** Combined the 0.093 (joint3 to joint4) and 0.09465 (joint4 to TCP) into L2 using Euclidean distance to account for their combined effect in the x-z plane.
3. **Clamping cos_theta3:** Ensured the argument to `math.acos` is within [-1, 1] to prevent domain errors due to numerical precision issues.
