To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4) for a 4-DOF robotic arm to position its end-effector (TCP) at a given target position (x, y, z). The solution involves leveraging geometric methods and trigonometric identities to derive a closed-form solution for the inverse kinematics of the robot.

### Approach
1. **Fixed Y-Coordinate**: The Y-coordinate of the TCP is fixed due to the structure of the robot, so we only need to solve for the X and Z coordinates.
2. **Three-Link Planar Arm**: The first three joints (theta1, theta2, theta3) are responsible for positioning the TCP in the X-Z plane. These can be treated as a three-link planar arm.
3. **Third Link Contribution**: The third link's contribution is combined with the TCP's offset to simplify the problem into a two-link inverse kinematics problem.
4. **Two-Link Solution**: Use the existing two-link inverse kinematics solution to find theta1 and theta2, then compute theta3 to align the third link with the target direction.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Theta4 does not affect the position and is set to 0 based on test cases
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Parameters for the three-link system
    a = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    b = 0.39225  # Length of the second link
    c = 0.093 + 0.09465  # Combined third link and TCP offset
    
    # Calculate the direction and distance to the target
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    d = math.hypot(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Adjust target for the first two links by subtracting the third link's contribution
    x_prime = x_target - c * math.sin(phi)
    z_prime = z_target - c * math.cos(phi)
    
    # Solve two-link inverse kinematics for the adjusted target
    d_sq = x_prime ** 2 + z_prime ** 2
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    gamma = math.atan2(x_prime, z_prime)
    delta = math.atan2(b * math.sin(theta2), a + b * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = gamma - delta
    
    # Compute theta3 to align the third link with the target direction
    theta3 = phi - (theta1 + theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Fixed Y-Coordinate**: The Y-coordinate of the TCP is fixed at -0.0267 due to the robot's structure, so theta4 is set to 0 as it does not affect the position.
2. **Three-Link Parameters**: The lengths of the first two links (0.425 and 0.39225) and the combined third link (0.093 + 0.09465) are used to simplify the problem.
3. **Target Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted by subtracting the contribution of the third link in the direction of the target, reducing the problem to a two-link inverse kinematics problem.
4. **Two-Link Solution**: Using the Law of Cosines and trigonometric identities, theta1 and theta2 are computed for the adjusted target. Theta3 is then derived to align the third link with the target direction.

This approach efficiently combines geometric methods and existing solutions to solve the inverse kinematics for the given robotic arm configuration.
