To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4) for a 4-DOF robotic arm to position its Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position (x, y, z). The solution involves decoupling the problem into two parts: determining the first joint angle (theta1) and solving for the remaining angles (theta2 and theta3) using geometric methods. The fourth joint angle (theta4) does not affect the position and can be set to zero.

### Approach
1. **Determine theta1**: The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis, affecting the x and z coordinates. The angle theta1 is calculated using the arctangent of the target's x and z coordinates.
2. **Adjust Target Position**: Compute the adjusted target position (A, B) for the subsequent joints by considering the position of the first joint.
3. **Solve for theta3**: Use the law of cosines to determine theta3 based on the adjusted target position and the lengths of the subsequent links.
4. **Solve for theta2**: Use trigonometric identities to solve for theta2 based on the adjusted target position and the computed theta3.
5. **Set theta4**: Since the fourth joint's rotation does not affect the TCP's position, set theta4 to zero.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the direction in x-z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    
    # Compute the adjusted target for the two-link system (theta2 and theta3)
    joint2_x = 0.425 * math.sin(theta1)
    joint2_z = 0.425 * math.cos(theta1)
    A = x_target - joint2_x
    B = z_target - joint2_z
    
    # Lengths of the two links (joint2 to joint3 and joint4 to TCP)
    L1 = 0.39225  # joint2 to joint3
    L2 = 0.09465   # joint4 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the numerator and denominator for theta3
    numerator = A**2 + B**2 - L1**2 - L2**2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * L2
    cos_theta3 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Clamp cos_theta3 to avoid domain errors due to numerical precision
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the two-link solution
    A_term = L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)
    B_term = L2 * math.sin(theta3)
    denominator_theta2 = A_term**2 + B_term**2
    sin_theta2 = (A_term * B - B_term * A) / denominator_theta2
    cos_theta2 = (A_term * A + B_term * B) / denominator_theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    # Theta4 does not affect the position, set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation**: The first joint angle (theta1) is determined using `atan2(x_target, z_target)` to align the arm in the direction of the target in the x-z plane.
2. **Adjusted Target**: The target position is adjusted to account for the position of the first joint, translating the problem into a two-link planar problem.
3. **Theta3 Calculation**: Using the law of cosines, the angle theta3 is computed to position the end of the two-link system at the adjusted target.
4. **Theta2 Calculation**: Using trigonometric identities, the angle theta2 is computed based on the adjusted target and theta3.
5. **Theta4 Handling**: The fourth joint angle (theta4) is set to zero as it does not influence the TCP's position, focusing only on reaching the target position.

This approach efficiently decouples the problem, leveraging geometric insights to simplify the solution for a 4-DOF robotic arm. The key corrections include using the correct link lengths and properly adjusting the target position to account for the first joint's contribution.
