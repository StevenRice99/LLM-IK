To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4) for a 4-DOF robotic arm such that the Tool Center Point (TCP) reaches a specified target position (x, y, z). The solution involves geometric analysis and trigonometric calculations to account for the arm's structure and joint constraints.

### Approach
1. **Joint 1 (q1)**: Calculate the angle to align the robotic arm with the target's projection in the XZ-plane.
2. **Joints 2 and 3 (q2, q3)**: Treat the structure as a planar 2R robot (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3) to solve for these angles using the law of cosines and geometric inverse kinematics. Consider both possible solutions (elbow up and elbow down) for q3 and select the appropriate one.
3. **Joint 4 (q4)**: Since the fourth joint does not affect the position, it is set to zero.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    L1 = 0.425  # Revolute1 to Revolute2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Revolute2 to Revolute3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Revolute3 to TCP

    # Calculate the desired position for Revolute3 (x', z') such that TCP can reach the target
    theta = np.arctan2(x_target, z_target)
    x_prime = x_target - L3 * np.sin(theta)
    z_prime = z_target - L3 * np.cos(theta)

    # Solve two-link IK for Revolute1 and Revolute2 to reach (x', z')
    D = np.hypot(x_prime, z_prime)
    if D == 0:
        q1 = 0.0
    else:
        q1 = np.arctan2(x_prime, z_prime)

    # Law of cosines to find q2
    cos_q2 = (D**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_q2 = np.clip(cos_q2, -1.0, 1.0)
    q2 = np.arccos(cos_q2)

    # Two possible solutions (elbow up and down)
    q2_1 = q2
    q2_2 = -q2

    # Calculate q1 for both solutions
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta_1 = np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(q2_1), L1 + L2 * np.cos(q2_1))
    q1_1 = alpha - beta_1

    beta_2 = np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(q2_2), L1 + L2 * np.cos(q2_2))
    q1_2 = alpha - beta_2

    # Compute q3 for both solutions
    x_revolute3_1 = L1 * np.sin(q1_1) + L2 * np.sin(q1_1 + q2_1)
    z_revolute3_1 = L1 * np.cos(q1_1) + L2 * np.cos(q1_1 + q2_1)
    theta_1 = np.arctan2(x_target - x_revolute3_1, z_target - z_revolute3_1)
    q3_1 = theta_1 - (q1_1 + q2_1)

    x_revolute3_2 = L1 * np.sin(q1_2) + L2 * np.sin(q1_2 + q2_2)
    z_revolute3_2 = L1 * np.cos(q1_2) + L2 * np.cos(q1_2 + q2_2)
    theta_2 = np.arctan2(x_target - x_revolute3_2, z_target - z_revolute3_2)
    q3_2 = theta_2 - (q1_2 + q2_2)

    # Select the solution with the smallest |q3|
    if abs(q3_1) <= abs(q3_2):
        q1, q2, q3 = q1_1, q2_1, q3_1
    else:
        q1, q2, q3 = q1_2, q2_2, q3_2

    q4 = 0.0

    return (q1, q2, q3, q4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint 1 (q1)**: The angle is calculated using `atan2(x_prime, z_prime)` to align the robotic arm with the adjusted target position for the first two links.
2. **Joints 2 and 3 (q2, q3)**: These are determined by solving the two-link inverse kinematics problem for the adjusted target position. The law of cosines helps find two possible solutions for `q2` (elbow up and down). The angle `q3` is computed to adjust the third link to reach the exact target position.
3. **Joint 4 (q4)**: Since it doesn't affect the position, it's set to zero. The solution selects the configuration with the smallest `q3` to avoid joint limits and ensure feasibility.

This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the target position by correctly accounting for the geometric configuration and joint constraints of the robotic arm, considering both possible solutions for the elbow configuration.
