To address the unreachable error and correctly compute the joint angles, we need to properly account for the robot's link offsets and adjust the target position and orientation transformations.

### Approach
1. **Position Adjustment:** 
   - Compute the first joint angle (θ₁) using the target's x and z coordinates.
   - Transform the target position into the coordinate frame after θ₁ rotation and adjust for the link offsets.
   
2. **Orientation Handling:** 
   - Use the transformed position and orientation to solve for the remaining joints (θ₂, θ₃, θ₄) using geometric and matrix transformations.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Compute theta1 using the existing code 1 approach
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)

    # Adjust the target position to the coordinate frame after theta1 rotation and link offsets
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    # Rotate target position to Revolute2's frame (after theta1 rotation)
    x_rot = x_target * cos_theta1 + z_target * sin_theta1
    z_rot = -x_target * sin_theta1 + z_target * cos_theta1
    # Adjust for Revolute2's position (0, -0.1197, 0.425) in its parent frame
    x_adj = x_rot - 0.0  # Revolute2's x is 0
    y_adj = y_target + 0.1197  # Revolute2's y is -0.1197 in parent frame
    z_adj = z_rot - 0.425  # Revolute2's z is 0.425

    # The remaining position to reach after Revolute2 (Revolute3, Revolute4, TCP)
    # Revolute3's position: [0, 0, 0.39225], Revolute4's: [0, 0.093, 0], TCP: [0, 0, 0.09465]
    # The effective length from Revolute2 to TCP is 0.39225 + 0.093 + 0.09465 = 0.5799
    # However, since Revolute4's axis is Z, the orientation affects the final position

    # Compute the target orientation matrix
    R_roll = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, np.cos(rx), -np.sin(rx)], [0, np.sin(rx), np.cos(rx)]])
    R_pitch = np.array([[np.cos(ry), 0, np.sin(ry)], [0, 1, 0], [-np.sin(ry), 0, np.cos(ry)]])
    R_yaw = np.array([[np.cos(rz), -np.sin(rz), 0], [np.sin(rz), np.cos(rz), 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    R_target = R_yaw @ R_pitch @ R_roll

    # Compute R_123 = R1 * R2 * R3
    # Use existing code 2 approach to solve theta2, theta3, theta4
    r13 = R_target[0, 2]
    r33 = R_target[2, 2]
    theta_sum = math.atan2(r13, r33)

    A = 0.39225  # Revolute3's z offset
    B = 0.093 + 0.09465  # Revolute4's y offset + TCP's z offset

    sin_S = math.sin(theta_sum)
    cos_S = math.cos(theta_sum)
    numerator_sin = x_adj - B * sin_S
    numerator_cos = z_adj - B * cos_S
    theta2 = math.atan2(numerator_sin, numerator_cos)
    theta3 = theta_sum - theta2

    # Compute theta4 from the orientation matrix
    R1 = np.array([[math.cos(theta1), 0, math.sin(theta1)],
                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-math.sin(theta1), 0, math.cos(theta1)]])
    R2 = np.array([[math.cos(theta2), 0, math.sin(theta2)],
                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-math.sin(theta2), 0, math.cos(theta2)]])
    R3 = np.array([[math.cos(theta3), 0, math.sin(theta3)],
                   [0, 1, 0],
                   [-math.sin(theta3), 0, math.cos(theta3)]])
    R123 = R1 @ R2 @ R3
    R4 = R123.T @ R_target
    theta4 = math.atan2(R4[1, 0], R4[0, 0])

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation:** The first joint angle is determined using the arctangent of the target's x and z coordinates, aligning the arm in the correct plane.
2. **Position Adjustment:** The target position is transformed into the coordinate frame after θ₁ rotation, adjusting for Revolute 2's offsets. This isolates the problem to a planar (x-z) problem for the remaining joints.
3. **Orientation Handling:** The target orientation is decomposed into a rotation matrix. The sum of the first three joint angles (θ_sum) is derived from this matrix to align the end-effector's orientation.
4. **Theta2 and Theta3:** These angles are computed using geometric relationships to achieve the adjusted target position.
5. **Theta4 Calculation:** The fourth joint angle is derived by aligning the cumulative rotation of the first three joints with the target orientation.

This approach ensures proper handling of link offsets and coordinate transformations, allowing the end-effector to reach the desired position and orientation.
