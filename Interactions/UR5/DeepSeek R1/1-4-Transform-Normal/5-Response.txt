To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF robot manipulator to reach a specified target position and orientation. The solution involves both orientation and position analysis, considering the robot's kinematic structure and the given joint constraints.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - The end-effector orientation is determined by the cumulative rotations of the first three joints (around the Y-axis) and the fourth joint (around the Z-axis).
   - The target orientation (given as roll, pitch, yaw) is converted to a rotation matrix. The robot's orientation is derived from the product of rotations due to each joint.
   - We compute two possible values for the sum of the first three joint angles (θ_sum) to account for both positive and negative solutions. The fourth joint angle (θ4) is derived from the target's roll and pitch angles.

2. **Position Analysis**:
   - The position of the end-effector is derived using forward kinematics, considering the geometric configuration of the robot links.
   - We solve the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics to determine the individual joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 using the computed θ_sum.

import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    x, y, z = p

    cos_rx = math.cos(r_x)
    cos_ry = math.cos(r_y)
    cos_theta_sum = cos_ry * cos_rx
    theta_sum_pos = math.acos(max(min(cos_theta_sum, 1.0), -1.0))
    theta_sum_neg = -theta_sum_pos
    possible_theta_sums = [theta_sum_pos, theta_sum_neg]

    solutions = []
    for theta_sum in possible_theta_sums:
        sin_theta_sum = math.sin(theta_sum)
        if abs(sin_theta_sum) < 1e-9:
            theta4 = r_z
        else:
            numerator_theta4 = math.cos(r_y) * math.sin(r_x)
            denominator_theta4 = math.sin(r_y)
            theta4 = math.atan2(numerator_theta4, denominator_theta4)

        C = 0.09465 * math.sin(theta_sum)
        D_val = 0.09465 * math.cos(theta_sum)
        A = 0.425
        B = 0.39225

        numerator = (x - C)**2 + (z - D_val)**2 - A**2 - B**2
        denominator = 2 * A * B
        K = numerator / denominator
        K = max(min(K, 1.0), -1.0)

        try:
            t2 = math.acos(K)
        except ValueError:
            continue

        for current_t2 in [t2, -t2]:
            M = A + B * math.cos(current_t2)
            N = B * math.sin(current_t2)
            denom = M**2 + N**2
            if denom < 1e-9:
                continue
            sin_t1 = (M * (x - C) - N * (z - D_val)) / denom
            cos_t1 = (M * (z - D_val) + N * (x - C)) / denom
            t1 = math.atan2(sin_t1, cos_t1)
            t3 = theta_sum - t1 - current_t2
            solutions.append((t1, current_t2, t3, theta4))

    if not solutions:
        raise ValueError("No valid solution found")

    return min(solutions, key=lambda sol: abs(sol[0]) + abs(sol[1]) + abs(sol[2]) + abs(sol[3]))
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - The sum of the first three joint angles (θ_sum) is derived using the target's roll and pitch angles. We consider both positive and negative solutions for θ_sum to account for all possible configurations.
   - The fourth joint angle (θ4) is determined using the target's roll and pitch angles, ensuring the correct orientation is achieved.

2. **Position Calculation**:
   - The target position is adjusted based on the derived θ_sum. Using geometric transformations and trigonometric identities, the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 are computed by solving the system of equations derived from the forward kinematics.
   - Multiple solutions are generated for both positive and negative θ_sum values, and the solution with the minimum joint displacements is selected to ensure the most efficient configuration.

This approach ensures that the robot's end-effector reaches the desired position and orientation by considering all possible kinematic configurations and selecting the optimal solution.
