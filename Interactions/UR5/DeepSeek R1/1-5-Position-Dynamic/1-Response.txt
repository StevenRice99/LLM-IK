To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to position its Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position. The solution involves breaking down the problem into two parts: positioning the third joint using the first two joints and then adjusting the remaining joints to reach the target from there.

### Approach
1. **First Two Joints (Theta1 and Theta2):** Use the provided inverse kinematics solution for the first two joints to position the third joint's origin in the x-z plane of the world frame.
2. **Displacement Calculation:** Compute the displacement from the third joint's origin to the target position in the world frame.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Rotate this displacement into the coordinate frame of the third joint to account for the rotations applied by the first two joints.
4. **Last Three Joints (Theta3, Theta4, Theta5):** Use the provided inverse kinematics solution for the last three joints to determine the angles needed to reach the target from the third joint's origin.

### Explanation
1. **First Two Joints:** The function `inverse_kinematics_existing1` calculates the angles for the first two joints to position the third joint's origin in the x-z plane.
2. **Displacement Calculation:** The displacement from the third joint's origin to the target is computed in the world frame.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** This displacement is rotated into the third joint's local frame to account for the rotations from the first two joints.
4. **Last Three Joints:** The function `inverse_kinematics_existing2` uses the transformed displacement to compute the angles for the last three joints, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position.

This approach efficiently decouples the problem into manageable parts, leveraging existing solutions for sub-chains to achieve the desired result.
