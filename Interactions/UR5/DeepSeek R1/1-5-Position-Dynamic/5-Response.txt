To solve this problem, we need to compute the inverse kinematics for a 5-DOF manipulator by correctly transforming the target position into the appropriate coordinate systems and adjusting for the manipulator's link lengths and offsets. The key issue in the previous solution was an incorrect rotation matrix when transforming the target position into Revolute 2's coordinate system, leading to invalid calculations. Here's the corrected approach:

### Approach
1. **Calculate Theta1**: Determine the first joint angle (theta1) by projecting the target position onto the x-z plane using the existing solution approach.
2. **Transform Target Position**: Adjust the target position to Revolute 2's coordinate system by accounting for Revolute 2's position in the base frame and correctly rotating by -theta1.
3. **Solve Remaining Joint Angles**: Use geometric methods to compute the remaining angles (theta2, theta3) based on the transformed target position, considering the manipulator's link lengths and offsets. Theta4 and theta5 are set to zero as they do not affect the position of the TCP in this configuration.

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation**: The first joint angle (theta1) is computed using the existing solution approach, which projects the target onto the x-z plane and calculates the angle using the arctangent function.
2. **Coordinate Transformation**: The target position is transformed into Revolute 2's coordinate system by subtracting Revolute 2's position in the base frame and applying the correct rotation by -theta1. This ensures the target is correctly aligned in Revolute 2's frame.
3. **Geometric Solution**: The remaining angles (theta2, theta3) are determined using geometric methods, considering the link lengths and offsets from the URDF. Theta4 and theta5 are set to zero as they do not affect the position of the TCP in this configuration. The corrected rotation matrix ensures accurate transformation, preventing the "Target xz is out of reach" error.
