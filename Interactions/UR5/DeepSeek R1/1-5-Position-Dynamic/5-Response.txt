To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to position its Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position while maintaining the required orientation. The solution involves breaking down the problem into two parts: positioning the third joint using the first two joints and then adjusting the remaining joints to reach the target from there, considering both position and orientation constraints.

### Approach
1. **First Two Joints (Theta1 and Theta2):** Use the provided inverse kinematics solution for the first two joints to position the third joint's origin in the x-z plane of the world frame.
2. **Displacement Calculation:** Compute the displacement from the third joint's origin to the target position in the world frame.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** Rotate this displacement into the coordinate frame of the third joint to account for the rotations applied by the first two joints.
4. **Last Three Joints (Theta3, Theta4, Theta5):** Solve for these angles considering both position and orientation constraints, ensuring the TCP reaches the target with the correct orientation.

### Explanation
1. **First Two Joints:** The function `inverse_kinematics_existing1` calculates the angles for the first two joints to position the third joint's origin in the x-z plane.
2. **Displacement Calculation:** The displacement from the third joint's origin to the target is computed in the world frame.
3. **Coordinate Transformation:** This displacement is rotated into the third joint's local frame to account for the rotations from the first two joints.
4. **Last Three Joints:** The function `inverse_kinematics_last_three` solves for the angles considering both position and orientation constraints. It uses the y-component to determine the required angle difference between theta4 and theta5, then solves for theta3 using the x and z components while assuming theta5 is zero to maintain the orientation constraint.

This approach ensures that the TCP reaches the target position while maintaining the required orientation, addressing both position and orientation constraints in the inverse kinematics solution.
