To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF manipulator to reach a target position. The solution involves calculating the angles for each joint using geometric and trigonometric methods, considering the structure and constraints provided in the URDF.

### Approach
1. **Solve for q4**: The Y component of the target position is used to determine q4, considering the contributions from the link offsets.
2. **Adjust Target Coordinates**: Adjust the X and Z components of the target position to account for the contributions from the links after the first three joints.
3. **Solve for q1, q2, and q3**: Treat the first three joints as a 3R planar arm and use geometric methods to solve for these angles, ensuring the adjusted target coordinates are reached.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Calculate q4 using the Y component of the target
    y_offset = y_target + 0.1197  # Adjust for Revolute 2's Y offset
    total_y_contribution = 0.1753  # 0.093 (Revolute 4) + 0.0823 (TCP)
    cos_q4 = y_offset / total_y_contribution
    cos_q4 = np.clip(cos_q4, -1.0, 1.0)
    q4 = np.arccos(cos_q4)
    q4 = -q4  # Select the negative solution based on feedback examples

    # Adjust X and Z targets for Revolute 4 and TCP contributions
    x_adj = x_target + 0.0823 * np.sin(q4)
    z_adj = z_target - 0.09465

    # Solve for q1, q2, q3 using geometric approach for 3R planar arm
    a1 = 0.425
    a2 = 0.39225
    a3 = 0.093

    # Calculate distance to adjusted target
    d = np.hypot(x_adj, z_adj)
    if d > a1 + a2 + a3 or d < np.abs(a1 - a2 - a3):
        raise ValueError("Target unreachable")

    # Solve for q2 using law of cosines
    cos_q2 = (x_adj**2 + z_adj**2 - a1**2 - a2**2) / (2 * a1 * a2)
    cos_q2 = np.clip(cos_q2, -1.0, 1.0)
    q2 = np.arccos(cos_q2)
    q2 = -q2  # Elbow down solution

    # Solve for q1
    gamma = np.arctan2(z_adj, x_adj)
    delta = np.arctan2(a2 * np.sin(q2), a1 + a2 * np.cos(q2))
    q1 = gamma - delta

    # Solve for q3 to adjust for a3 contribution
    x_current = a1 * np.sin(q1) + a2 * np.sin(q1 + q2)
    z_current = a1 * np.cos(q1) + a2 * np.cos(q1 + q2)
    dx = x_adj - x_current
    dz = z_adj - z_current
    q3 = np.arctan2(dx, dz) - (q1 + q2)
    q3 = np.arctan2(np.sin(q3), np.cos(q3))  # Normalize angle

    # Assume q5 is 0 as per problem constraints
    q5 = 0.0

    return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
```

### Explanation
1. **q4 Calculation**: The Y component of the target is adjusted for the fixed offsets and used to compute q4 using the arccosine function. The negative solution is chosen based on feedback examples.
2. **Target Adjustment**: The X and Z targets are adjusted to account for the contributions from the links after the first three joints, considering the rotation due to q4.
3. **3R Planar Arm Solution**: The first three joints are treated as a 3R planar arm. The law of cosines and trigonometric identities are used to solve for q1 and q2. The third joint (q3) is then adjusted to fine-tune the position based on the remaining error.

This approach ensures that the manipulator's end-effector reaches the desired target position by systematically solving each joint angle while considering the geometric constraints of the robot.
