To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator, we need to accurately determine each joint angle by considering the geometric relationships and link contributions. Here's the improved approach:

### Approach
1. **Calculate q4**: Determine the possible angles for q4 using the Y component of the target position, considering both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations.
2. **Adjust Target Coordinates**: Correctly adjust the X and Z components to account for the TCP's position relative to the manipulator's structure.
3. **Solve for q1, q2, q3**: Treat the first three joints as a 3R planar arm and use geometric methods to solve these angles, ensuring the adjusted target is reached.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Calculate possible q4 solutions from Y component
    y_tcp_contribution = 0.0823
    y_revolute4 = 0.093
    cos_q4 = (y_target - y_revolute4) / y_tcp_contribution
    cos_q4 = np.clip(cos_q4, -1.0, 1.0)
    q4_pos = np.arccos(cos_q4)
    q4_neg = -q4_pos

    # Select q4 based on which solution places TCP closer to target X
    x_pos_effect_pos = y_tcp_contribution * np.sin(q4_pos)
    x_pos_effect_neg = y_tcp_contribution * np.sin(q4_neg)
    if abs(x_target - x_pos_effect_pos) < abs(x_target - x_pos_effect_neg):
        q4 = q4_pos
    else:
        q4 = q4_neg

    # Adjust X and Z targets for TCP and Revolute5 offsets
    x_adj = x_target - y_tcp_contribution * np.sin(q4)
    z_adj = z_target - 0.09465  # Revolute5 Z offset

    # Solve for q1, q2, q3 using 3R planar arm geometry
    a1 = 0.425  # Revolute2 Z offset
    a2 = 0.39225  # Revolute3 Z offset
    a3 = 0.093  # Revolute4 X offset

    # Calculate planar target coordinates
    planar_target = np.sqrt(x_adj**2 + z_adj**2)

    # Law of cosines for q2
    cos_q2 = (x_adj**2 + z_adj**2 - a1**2 - a2**2) / (2 * a1 * a2)
    cos_q2 = np.clip(cos_q2, -1.0, 1.0)
    q2 = np.arccos(cos_q2)
    q2 = -q2  # Elbow down configuration

    # Calculate q1
    gamma = np.arctan2(z_adj, x_adj)
    delta = np.arctan2(a2 * np.sin(q2), a1 + a2 * np.cos(q2))
    q1 = gamma - delta

    # Calculate current position after q1 and q2
    x_current = a1 * np.sin(q1) + a2 * np.sin(q1 + q2)
    z_current = a1 * np.cos(q1) + a2 * np.cos(q1 + q2)

    # Solve q3 to account for a3 contribution
    dx = x_adj - x_current
    dz = z_adj - z_current
    q3 = np.arctan2(dx, dz) - (q1 + q2)
    q3 = np.arctan2(np.sin(q3), np.cos(q3))  # Normalize angle

    # Set q5 to 0 as per problem constraints
    q5 = 0.0

    return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
```

### Explanation
1. **q4 Calculation**: The Y component of the target is used to compute two possible q4 values (positive and negative). The correct solution is chosen based on which minimizes the X position error, ensuring proper alignment.
2. **Target Adjustment**: The X and Z targets are adjusted to account for the TCP's position relative to Revolute4 and Revolute5, considering the rotation from q4.
3. **Planar Arm Solution**: The first three joints are treated as a 3R planar arm. Using trigonometric relationships and the law of cosines, q1 and q2 are determined. The third joint (q3) is adjusted to correct for any remaining positional error, ensuring precise target reachability.

This approach systematically addresses each joint's contribution, ensuring the manipulator accurately reaches the desired target position.
