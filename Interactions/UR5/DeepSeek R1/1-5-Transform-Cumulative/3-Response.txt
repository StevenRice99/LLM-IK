To address the issues identified, the solution must correctly handle the geometric calculations for the first three joints and accurately decompose the remaining rotation for the last two joints. Here's the improved approach:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Compute target rotation matrix
    cr, sr = np.cos(roll), np.sin(roll)
    cp, sp = np.cos(pitch), np.sin(pitch)
    cy, sy = np.cos(yaw), np.sin(yaw)
    R_target = np.array([
        [cy * cp, cy * sp * sr - sy * cr, cy * sp * cr + sy * sr],
        [sy * cp, sy * sp * sr + cy * cr, sy * sp * cr - cy * sr],
        [-sp, cp * sr, cp * cr]
    ])

    # Adjust for TCP's fixed orientation (R_tcp_inv)
    R_tcp = np.array([[0, -1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])  # 90Â° Z rotation
    R_target_adj = R_target @ R_tcp.T

    # Calculate theta_sum from adjusted rotation matrix
    r13 = R_target_adj[0, 2]
    r33 = R_target_adj[2, 2]
    theta_sum = math.atan2(r13, r33)

    # Adjust target position for TCP's offset (joint5 and TCP)
    C_tcp = 0.09465 + 0.0823  # Combined length along theta_sum direction
    pos3_x = x_target - C_tcp * math.sin(theta_sum)
    pos3_z = z_target - C_tcp * math.cos(theta_sum)

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using geometric approach
    a, b = 0.425, 0.39225
    x, z = pos3_x, pos3_z
    d_sq = x**2 + z**2
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2_1 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta2_2 = -theta2_1

    solutions = []
    for theta2 in [theta2_1, theta2_2]:
        denom = a + b * math.cos(theta2)
        num = b * math.sin(theta2)
        theta1 = math.atan2(x * denom - z * num, z * denom + x * num)
        x_calc = a * math.sin(theta1) + b * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
        z_calc = a * math.cos(theta1) + b * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
        error = math.hypot(x_calc - x, z_calc - z)
        solutions.append((theta1, theta2, error))

    # Select solution with minimum error
    solutions.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    theta1, theta2, _ = solutions[0]
    theta3 = theta_sum - theta1 - theta2

    # Compute remaining rotation after first three joints
    R_y_sum = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta_sum), 0, math.sin(theta_sum)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(theta_sum), 0, math.cos(theta_sum)]
    ])
    R_remaining = R_y_sum.T @ R_target_adj

    # Solve for theta4 (Z) and theta5 (Y)
    theta5 = math.atan2(-R_remaining[2, 0], R_remaining[2, 2])
    sin_theta4 = -R_remaining[0, 1]
    cos_theta4 = R_remaining[1, 1]
    theta4 = math.atan2(sin_theta4, cos_theta4)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Position Adjustment:** The combined offset from joint4 to TCP is approximated along the direction determined by `theta_sum`, using the sum of Revolute5's and TCP's lengths. This simplifies the complex transformations into a single directional offset.

2. **Geometric Solution for Theta1 and Theta2:** The code generates both possible solutions for `theta2` (positive and negative) and selects the one with the smallest positional error, ensuring a more robust solution.

3. **Orientation Decomposition:** The remaining rotation matrix is decomposed into `theta4` (Z-axis) and `theta5` (Y-axis) using the correct matrix elements, considering the joint axes and their order.

This approach improves the handling of multiple solutions and provides a more accurate decomposition of the orientation, leading to better alignment with the target position and orientation.
