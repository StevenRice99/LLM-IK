To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF serial manipulator to reach a specified position and orientation. The solution involves calculating the joint angles using geometric and trigonometric methods, considering the robot's link lengths and rotational axes.

### Approach
1. **Rotation Matrix Calculation**: Convert the target orientation (given as roll, pitch, yaw) into a rotation matrix.
2. **Adjust for TCP Orientation**: The Tool Center Point (TCP) has a fixed orientation which must be accounted for by adjusting the target rotation matrix.
3. **Position Adjustment**: Adjust the target position to account for the TCP's position relative to the last joint using the correct offset direction.
4. **Solve for Joint Angles 1-3**: Use geometric methods to determine the first three joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) to position the end-effector.
5. **Solve for Joint Angles 4-5**: Decompose the remaining rotation needed to achieve the target orientation into the Z and Y rotations for the fourth and fifth joints.

### Explanation
1. **Rotation Matrix Calculation**: The target orientation is converted into a rotation matrix using the roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
2. **Adjust for TCP Orientation**: The fixed orientation of the TCP is accounted for by adjusting the target rotation matrix.
3. **Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted to account for the TCP's position relative to the last joint using the correct offset direction derived from the URDF specifications.
4. **Geometric Solution for Joints 1-3**: Using geometric methods, the first three joint angles are determined to position the end-effector, considering both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations and selecting the solution with the smallest positional error.
5. **Orientation Decomposition**: The remaining rotation needed to achieve the target orientation is decomposed into the Z and Y rotations for the fourth and fifth joints using the correct matrix elements, ensuring accurate orientation alignment.

This approach ensures that the manipulator accurately reaches the target position and orientation by correctly handling the geometric and rotational components of the inverse kinematics problem.
