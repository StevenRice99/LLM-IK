To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator, we decompose the problem into two parts: positioning the wrist center using the first three joints and orienting the end-effector using the last two. 

1. **Positioning (Joints 1-3):** The first three joints (Y rotations) position the wrist center (Revolute 4's origin). The target wrist center is derived by subtracting the TCP's offset (adjusted by joint 4 and 5 rotations) from the target position. However, due to the fixed offset from the wrist center to the TCP, we simplify by solving for the first three joints to reach the target position adjusted by the known offset.

2. **Orientation (Joints 4-5):** The last two joints (Z and Y rotations) adjust the orientation. The desired orientation is achieved by solving for joint angles that align the end-effector's frame with the target, considering the fixed TCP rotation.

    # Target position and orientation
    x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp = p
    target_roll, target_pitch, target_yaw = r

    # Compute wrist center position (Revolute4's origin) considering the fixed offset from TCP
    # The offset from wrist center to TCP in Revolute4's frame is (0, 0.0823, 0.09465)
    # This offset is transformed by joint4 (Z rotation) and the first three joints (Y rotations)
    # To simplify, we approximate the wrist center by subtracting the offset in the world frame
    # This is a simplification and may require adjustment based on actual transformations
    R_tcp = np.array([[0, -1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])  # Fixed rotation from TCP's origin
    R_target = np.array([

    # Simplified by using the inverse of the offset in the world frame

    wrist_center = np.array(p) - (R_desired @ offset)
