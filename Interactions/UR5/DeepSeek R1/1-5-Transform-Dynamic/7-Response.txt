To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a target position and orientation. The solution involves positioning the wrist center using the first three joints and adjusting the orientation with the last two joints. Here's the approach:

1. **Calculate the Wrist Center (WC):** The WC is derived by subtracting the TCP's offset (transformed by the desired orientation) from the target position.
2. **Solve for Joints 1-2:** Use geometric inverse kinematics to position the WC by solving the planar 2R chain formed by the first two joints.
3. **Solve for Joints 3-5:** Compute the remaining rotation needed and decompose it into the respective Euler angles for the last three joints.

    # Target position and orientation
    x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp = p
    target_roll, target_pitch, target_yaw = r

    # Compute desired orientation matrix
    cr, cp, cy = math.cos(target_roll), math.cos(target_pitch), math.cos(target_yaw)
    sr, sp, sy = math.sin(target_roll), math.sin(target_pitch), math.sin(target_yaw)
    R_target = np.array([
        [cy * cp, cy * sp * sr - sy * cr, cy * sp * cr + sy * sr],
        [sy * cp, sy * sp * sr + cy * cr, sy * sp * cr - cy * sr],
        [-sp, cp * sr, cp * cr]
    ])

    # TCP offset from wrist center in TCP's frame (Revolute4 to TCP)
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0.0823, 0.09465])
    wrist_center = np.array(p) - R_target @ tcp_offset

    # Wrist center Y must be -0.0267 (fixed by link structure)
    x_wc, _, z_wc = wrist_center
    y_wc = -0.0267

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using existing code 1 logic for planar 2R
    a1, a2 = 0.425, 0.39225
    dx, dz = x_wc, z_wc

    # Law of cosines for planar 2R
    D_sq = dx**2 + dz**2
    D = math.sqrt(D_sq)

    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    theta1 = math.atan2(dx, dz) - math.atan2(a2 * math.sin(theta2), a1 + a2 * math.cos(theta2))

    ])
    R_joints_12 = R1 @ R2

    else:
        # Gimbal lock case
        theta3 = 0.0
        theta5 = math.atan2(-R_remaining[0, 1], R_remaining[0, 0])

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Wrist Center Calculation:** The wrist center is computed by subtracting the TCP's offset (transformed by the target orientation) from the target position. This offset accounts for the kinematic chain from the wrist to the TCP.
2. **Joints 1-2 Solution:** Using geometric inverse kinematics for a planar 2R chain, the first two joint angles (theta1, theta2) are determined to position the wrist center's X and Z coordinates.
3. **Orientation Adjustment:** The remaining rotation needed to achieve the target orientation is decomposed into Euler angles (Y-Z-Y) corresponding to the last three joints (theta3, theta4, theta5). This accounts for the orientation contribution from all joints to align the TCP as desired.
