To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position and orientation. The solution involves decomposing the problem into position and orientation components, considering the kinematic chain and the effect of each joint on the end-effector's position and orientation.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Decomposition**: Decompose the target orientation into three rotational components: the sum of the first three joint angles (theta_sum), the fourth joint angle (theta4) around the Z-axis, and the fifth joint angle (theta5) around the Y-axis.
2. **Position Adjustment**: Adjust the target position to account for the offsets from the fifth joint and the end-effector (TCP) by transforming these offsets into the world frame using the derived orientation angles.
3. **Geometric Solution for Position**: Use a geometric approach to solve for the first three joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) such that their sum equals theta_sum and they position the wrist (link4's origin) correctly.

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Decomposition**: The target orientation matrix is decomposed into rotations around the Z and Y axes to determine theta4 and theta5. The remaining rotation is used to find theta_sum, the sum of the first three joint angles.
2. **Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted to account for the offsets from the fifth joint and the TCP. This adjustment involves transforming these offsets into the world frame using the derived orientation angles.
3. **Geometric Solution**: The first three joint angles are determined using a geometric approach to position the wrist correctly. The sum of these angles is constrained to equal theta_sum, ensuring the correct orientation from the first three joints.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the end-effector are accurately reached by considering the entire kinematic chain and the effects of each joint rotation.
