To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position and orientation. The solution involves decomposing the problem into position and orientation components, considering the kinematic chain and the effect of each joint on the end-effector's position and orientation.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Decomposition**: Decompose the target orientation into rotations around the Z-axis (theta4) and Y-axis (theta5) to achieve the target orientation. The remaining rotation is used to find the sum of the first three joint angles (theta_sum).
2. **Position Adjustment**: Adjust the target position to account for the offsets from the fifth joint and the end-effector (TCP) by transforming these offsets into the world frame using the derived orientation angles.
3. **Geometric Solution for Position**: Use a geometric approach to solve for the first three joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) such that their sum equals theta_sum and they position the wrist (link4's origin) correctly.

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Decomposition**: The target orientation matrix is decomposed into rotations around the Z-axis (theta4) and Y-axis (theta5). The remaining rotation is used to find the sum of the first three joint angles (theta_sum).
2. **Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted by transforming the TCP offset (considering the derived theta4 and theta_sum) into the world frame. This gives the wrist position, which must be reached by the first three joints.
3. **Geometric Solution**: The first three joint angles are determined using a geometric approach to position the wrist correctly, ensuring their sum equals theta_sum. This involves solving a system of equations based on the robot's link lengths and the derived wrist position.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the end-effector are accurately reached by considering the entire kinematic chain and the effects of each joint rotation.
