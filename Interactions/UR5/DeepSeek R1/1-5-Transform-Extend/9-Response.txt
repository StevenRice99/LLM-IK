To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position and orientation. The solution involves decomposing the problem into position and orientation components, considering the kinematic chain and the effect of each joint on the end-effector's position and orientation.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Decomposition**: Decompose the target orientation into rotations around the Z-axis (theta4) and Y-axis (theta5) using elements of the target rotation matrix. This allows us to isolate the contributions of these joints to the end-effector's orientation.
2. **Position Adjustment**: Adjust the target position to account for the offsets from the fifth joint and the end-effector (TCP) by transforming these offsets into the world frame using the derived orientation angles. The wrist position (link4's origin) has a fixed y-coordinate, which is used to constrain the solution.
3. **Geometric Solution for Position**: Use a geometric approach to solve for the first three joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) such that their sum equals theta_sum (derived from the orientation decomposition) and they position the wrist correctly.

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Decomposition**: The target rotation matrix is decomposed to solve for theta4 and theta5 using the constraints derived from the fixed wrist y-coordinate and the target orientation matrix elements.
2. **Position Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted by transforming the TCP offset (considering theta4 and theta5) into the world frame. The wrist position is calculated by subtracting this offset from the target position.
3. **Geometric Solution**: The first three joint angles are determined using a geometric approach to position the wrist correctly, ensuring their sum equals theta_sum. This involves solving a system of equations based on the robot's link lengths and the derived wrist position.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the end-effector are accurately reached by considering the entire kinematic chain and the effects of each joint rotation.
