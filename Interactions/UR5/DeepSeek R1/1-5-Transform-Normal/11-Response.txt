To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position and orientation. The solution involves correctly computing the offset from the wrist to the TCP and using geometric and algebraic methods to decouple the position and orientation problems.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Adjustment**: The target orientation is adjusted to account for the TCP's default orientation (90-degree rotation around Z). The adjusted orientation is decomposed into rotations around Z (q4) and Y (q5) axes to determine the necessary joint angles.
2. **Wrist Center Calculation**: The wrist center's position is derived from the target position by accounting for the offset from the wrist to the TCP, which depends on q4 and q5. The Y-coordinate constraint is used to solve for possible q4 and q5 values.
3. **Inverse Kinematics for Position**: The first three joint angles (q1, q2, q3) are determined using geometric inverse kinematics to position the wrist center correctly.
4. **Validation**: Each solution is checked against joint limits to ensure validity, and the first valid solution is returned.

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Adjustment**: The target orientation is adjusted for the TCP's default orientation (90-degree rotation around Z). The adjusted orientation is decomposed into rotations around Z (q4) and Y (q5) axes using the correct joint axes.
2. **Wrist Center Calculation**: The wrist center's position is derived by solving for q4 and q5 using the Y-coordinate constraint and the target position. The offset from the wrist to the TCP is computed based on these angles.
3. **Inverse Kinematics for Position**: The first three joint angles (q1, q2, q3) are determined using geometric inverse kinematics to position the wrist center correctly. The solution considers the contributions of all three joints to the wrist position.
4. **Validation**: Each solution is checked against joint limits to ensure validity, and the first valid solution is returned. This approach ensures that all possible solutions are considered, addressing the issues in previous implementations.
