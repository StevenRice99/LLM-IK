To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 5-DOF robotic arm to reach a specified target position and orientation. The solution involves both geometric and algebraic methods to decouple the position and orientation problems, ensuring that the wrist center is correctly positioned and the end-effector orientation is achieved.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Adjustment**: The target orientation is adjusted to account for the TCP's default orientation (90-degree rotation around Z). This adjusted orientation is decomposed into Y-Z-Y Euler angles to determine the necessary joint angles for the last two joints (q4 and q5).
2. **Positioning the Wrist Center**: The first three joints (q1, q2, q3) are responsible for positioning the wrist center. The wrist center's position is derived from the target position by accounting for the offset from the wrist to the TCP, which depends on q4 and q5.
3. **Geometric Calculations**: Using trigonometric identities and inverse kinematics, we solve for the joint angles that position the wrist center and adjust the orientation.

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Adjustment**: The target orientation is adjusted to account for the TCP's default orientation (90-degree rotation around Z). This adjusted orientation is decomposed into Y-Z-Y Euler angles to determine the necessary joint angles for the last two joints (q4 and q5).
2. **Wrist Center Calculation**: The wrist center's position is derived by subtracting the offset (dependent on q4 and q5) from the target position. This offset is calculated using both q4 and q5 to ensure accuracy.
3. **Inverse Kinematics for Position**: Using geometric calculations, the joint angles q1 and q2 are determined to position the wrist center correctly. The third joint angle q3 is derived from the orientation solution.
4. **Validation**: Each solution is checked for validity against joint limits and the fixed Y-coordinate constraint of the wrist center. The first valid solution is returned, ensuring the target is reachable as per the problem constraints.
