To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 3-DOF serial manipulator to position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target position. The solution involves calculating the angles for the first two revolute joints (around the Y-axis) and setting the third revolute joint (around the Z-axis) to a default value since it does not affect the position of the TCP.

### Approach
1. **Problem Analysis**: The first two joints (Revolute 1 and Revolute 2) control the position of the TCP in the XZ plane, while the third joint (Revolute 3) affects the orientation but not the position. The target position's Y-coordinate is fixed at 0.093 due to the manipulator's structure.
2. **Forward Kinematics**: The position of the TCP is derived using the lengths of the links and the angles of the first two joints. The third joint's angle is set to zero as it does not influence the position.
3. **Inverse Kinematics**: Using the law of cosines and trigonometric identities, we solve for the angles of the first two joints to position the TCP at the target coordinates in the XZ plane.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    a = 0.39225  # Length from base to Revolute 2
    b = 0.09465  # Length from Revolute 3 to TCP

    # Calculate the squared distance from the base projection on the XZ plane
    d_sq = x**2 + z**2

    # Compute cos(theta2) using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)  # Clamp to avoid numerical errors
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Compute theta1 using geometric relationships
    gamma = math.atan2(x, z)
    delta = math.atan2(b * math.sin(theta2), a + b * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = gamma - delta

    # Theta3 does not affect the position, set to 0
    theta3 = 0.0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Law of Cosines**: We use the law of cosines to determine the angle of the second joint (theta2) based on the target position's distance from the base.
2. **Trigonometric Calculation**: The angle of the first joint (theta1) is calculated using the arctangent function to account for both the target's X and Z coordinates, adjusted by the geometric relationship involving the second joint's angle.
3. **Third Joint Handling**: The third joint's angle (theta3) is set to zero since it does not affect the TCP's position, only its orientation.

This approach efficiently computes the necessary joint angles to position the TCP at the desired coordinates, leveraging geometric and trigonometric principles.
