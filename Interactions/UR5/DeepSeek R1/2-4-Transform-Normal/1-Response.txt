To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) for a 3-DOF serial manipulator such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves both position and orientation analysis using inverse kinematics.

### Approach
1. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - Convert the target orientation (given as roll, pitch, yaw angles) into a rotation matrix.
   - Extract the necessary elements from this rotation matrix to compute the sum of the first two joint angles (theta_sum = theta1 + theta2) and the third joint angle (theta3).

2. **Position Analysis**:
   - Use the target position coordinates (x, y, z) to solve for the individual joint angles theta1 and theta2. The y-coordinate is fixed due to the robot's structure, so we focus on x and z coordinates.
   - Compute theta1 using the derived equations from the position components and then determine theta2 using the previously computed theta_sum.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Compute the target rotation matrix from RPY angles (X, Y, Z)
    R_roll = np.array([
        [1, 0, 0],
        [0, np.cos(rx), -np.sin(rx)],
        [0, np.sin(rx), np.cos(rx)]
    ])
    R_pitch = np.array([
        [np.cos(ry), 0, np.sin(ry)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-np.sin(ry), 0, np.cos(ry)]
    ])
    R_yaw = np.array([
        [np.cos(rz), -np.sin(rz), 0],
        [np.sin(rz), np.cos(rz), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    R_target = R_yaw @ R_pitch @ R_roll

    # Solve for theta_sum (theta1 + theta2) and theta3 from orientation
    r13 = R_target[0, 2]
    r33 = R_target[2, 2]
    theta_sum = np.arctan2(r13, r33)

    r21 = R_target[1, 0]
    r22 = R_target[1, 1]
    theta3 = np.arctan2(r21, r22)

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 from position
    A = 0.39225
    B = 0.09465

    sin_S = np.sin(theta_sum)
    cos_S = np.cos(theta_sum)

    numerator_sin = x_target - B * sin_S
    numerator_cos = z_target - B * cos_S
    theta1 = np.arctan2(numerator_sin, numerator_cos)
    theta2 = theta_sum - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - The target orientation is converted into a rotation matrix using roll, pitch, and yaw angles. This matrix helps in determining the combined angle (theta_sum) of the first two joints and the angle of the third joint (theta3).

2. **Position Calculation**:
   - The position equations are derived based on the geometry of the robot. By solving these equations, we determine the individual angles theta1 and theta2. The sum of these angles (theta_sum) is already known from the orientation analysis, allowing us to isolate each angle.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the end-effector are achieved using the computed joint angles, assuming the target is reachable.
