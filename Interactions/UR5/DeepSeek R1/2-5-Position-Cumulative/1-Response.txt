To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator, we decompose the problem into solving for the first two joints (theta1 and theta2) to position the arm in the X-Z plane and the last two joints (theta3 and theta4) to adjust the Y component. 

### Approach
1. **Theta1 and Theta2 (X-Z Positioning):** Use geometric methods to solve for the first two joints based on the target X and Z coordinates, adjusting for the link lengths.
2. **Theta3 and Theta4 (Y Positioning):** Solve for the last two joints to achieve the target Y coordinate, considering the vertical offsets from the links and the TCP.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using Existing 2's approach
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    adjusted_x = x_target - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z_target - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1

    # Solve for theta3 and theta4 based on y_target
    a = 0.0823  # TCP's Y offset
    L3 = 0.093   # Revolute 3's Y offset
    L4 = 0.09465 # Revolute 4's Z offset

    # Calculate the required vertical contribution from theta3 and theta4
    y_contrib = y_target - L3
    if abs(y_contrib) > a + L4:
        raise ValueError("Target Y position unreachable")

    # Solve for theta3 and theta4 using geometric approach
    # Assuming theta4 is set to adjust the remaining Y contribution
    theta4 = math.asin(y_contrib / a)
    theta3 = 0.0  # Assuming theta3 is zero as per the problem's structure

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 and Theta2 Calculation:** 
   - The first joint (theta1) is determined by the arctangent of the target X and Z coordinates.
   - The second joint (theta2) is adjusted based on the remaining distance after accounting for the first link's length.

2. **Theta3 and Theta4 Calculation:**
   - The Y component is adjusted by subtracting the fixed offset from Revolute 3.
   - Theta4 is calculated to achieve the remaining Y component using the TCP's offset, assuming theta3 is zero due to the manipulator's structure.

This approach leverages geometric decomposition to handle the planar positioning and vertical adjustment separately, providing a closed-form solution for the inverse kinematics.
