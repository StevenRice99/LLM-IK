To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4) for a 4-DOF manipulator to reach a target position (x, y, z). The solution involves decoupling the problem into solving for the vertical (Y-axis) and horizontal (X-Z plane) components separately, considering the structure and transformations of each joint.

### Approach
1. **Y Component (theta3 and theta4):** The Y component of the target position is achieved by adjusting theta3 (Z rotation) and theta4 (Y rotation). These rotations affect the vertical position of the end-effector (TCP) through trigonometric relationships.
2. **X-Z Components (theta1 and theta2):** The horizontal components (X and Z) are addressed by solving for theta1 and theta2 using geometric inverse kinematics, considering the contributions from the links and subsequent joints.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Constants from the URDF
    L1 = 0.39225  # Revolute 2's Z offset
    L3 = 0.093     # Revolute 3's Y offset
    L4 = 0.09465   # Revolute 4's Z offset
    a = 0.0823     # TCP's Y offset

    # Solve for Y component involving theta3 and theta4
    y_eff = y_target - L3
    if abs(y_eff) > a + L4:
        raise ValueError("Target Y position unreachable")

    # Using geometric approach for Y component
    theta4 = math.asin(y_eff / a)
    theta3 = 0.0  # Assume theta3 is zero as per problem's orientation constraint

    # Adjust target for X-Z components considering Revolute 4 and TCP
    # Compute effective X-Z target by reversing the contribution of theta4 and a
    eff_x = x_target - a * math.cos(theta4) * math.sin(theta3)
    eff_z = z_target - a * math.cos(theta4) * math.cos(theta3)

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using Existing solution 3's approach
    # Adjusting for L4 (Revolute 4's Z offset)
    numerator = eff_x ** 2 + eff_z ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - (L4) ** 2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * L4
    if abs(denominator) < 1e-9:
        raise ValueError("Division by zero in theta2 calculation")
    cos_theta2 = numerator / denominator
    if abs(cos_theta2) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target X-Z position unreachable")
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Two possible solutions for theta2 (elbow up/down)
    theta2_options = [theta2, -theta2]
    solutions = []
    for t2 in theta2_options:
        A = L1 + L4 * math.cos(t2)
        B = L4 * math.sin(t2)
        denom = A**2 + B**2
        if denom < 1e-10:
            continue
        sin_theta1 = (A * eff_x - B * eff_z) / denom
        cos_theta1 = (B * eff_x + A * eff_z) / denom
        theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
        solutions.append((theta1, t2))

    if not solutions:
        raise ValueError("No valid solution for theta1 and theta2")

    # Select the first valid solution (additional checks for joint limits can be added)
    theta1, theta2 = solutions[0]

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Y Component Calculation:** The Y component of the target position is adjusted by subtracting the fixed offset from Revolute 3. The remaining Y component is used to solve for theta4 using the arcsine function, considering the TCP's Y offset.
2. **X-Z Component Calculation:** The effective X and Z targets are computed by adjusting for the contributions from Revolute 4 and the TCP. The geometric approach from existing solutions is used to solve for theta1 and theta2, considering the link lengths and trigonometric relationships.
3. **Joint Limits and Multiple Solutions:** The solution considers multiple possible configurations (elbow up/down) for theta2 and selects the first valid solution, with additional checks for feasibility.

This approach decouples the problem into manageable parts, leveraging geometric transformations and trigonometric relationships to achieve the desired end-effector position.
