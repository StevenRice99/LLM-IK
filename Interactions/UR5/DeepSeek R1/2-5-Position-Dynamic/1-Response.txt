To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF robotic manipulator to reach a specified target position. The solution involves decomposing the problem into two main parts: determining the first joint angle and then solving for the remaining three angles using the transformed target position.

### Approach
1. **First Joint (Theta1)**: The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle for this joint is determined using the arctangent function to align the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane.
2. **Transformation to Revolute 2's Frame**: After determining Theta1, the target position is transformed into the coordinate system relative to the second joint (Revolute 2). This involves rotating the target position by -Theta1 and adjusting for the translation from the base to Revolute 2.
3. **Remaining Joints (Theta2, Theta3, Theta4)**: Using the transformed target position, we solve for the remaining three joints. This involves geometric calculations to handle the planar sub-problem formed by the subsequent joints and links.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the first existing method
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Transform the target position into Revolute 2's frame
    x_rot = x * math.cos(theta1) - z * math.sin(theta1)
    z_rot = x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1)
    x_target = x_rot
    y_target = y
    z_target = z_rot - 0.39225  # Adjust for Revolute 2's z offset
    
    # Parameters from the problem details
    a = 0.0823  # TCP's y offset
    L1 = 0.093   # Revolute 3's y offset
    L2 = 0.09465 # Revolute 4's z offset
    
    # Solve for theta2, theta3, theta4 using the second existing method logic
    c2 = (y_target - L1) / a
    if abs(c2) > 1:
        raise ValueError('Target position is unreachable')
    s2 = math.sqrt(1 - c2 ** 2)
    theta2_options = [math.acos(c2), -math.acos(c2)]
    
    best_solution = None
    min_error = float('inf')
    
    for theta2 in theta2_options:
        current_s2 = math.sin(theta2)
        A = L2
        B = -a * current_s2
        denominator = A ** 2 + (a * current_s2) ** 2
        if denominator < 1e-10:
            continue
        
        sin_theta1_sub = (A * x_target - B * z_target) / denominator
        cos_theta1_sub = (A * z_target + B * x_target) / denominator
        if abs(sin_theta1_sub ** 2 + cos_theta1_sub ** 2 - 1) > 1e-6:
            continue
        
        theta1_sub = math.atan2(sin_theta1_sub, cos_theta1_sub)
        
        # Calculate the position for error checking
        x_curr = L2 * math.sin(theta1_sub) - a * current_s2 * math.cos(theta1_sub)
        z_curr = L2 * math.cos(theta1_sub) + a * current_s2 * math.sin(theta1_sub)
        error = (x_curr - x_target) ** 2 + (z_curr - z_target) ** 2
        
        if error < min_error:
            min_error = error
            best_solution = (theta1_sub, theta2, 0.0)  # Assuming theta4 is 0.0 as per existing code
    
    if best_solution is None:
        raise ValueError('Target position is unreachable')
    
    theta2_sub, theta3_sub, theta4_sub = best_solution
    
    return (theta1, theta2_sub, theta3_sub, theta4_sub)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation**: The first joint angle (Theta1) is calculated using the arctangent of the target's X and Z coordinates, aligning the manipulator in the direction of the target's projection on the X-Z plane.
2. **Coordinate Transformation**: The target position is transformed into the coordinate system of the second joint (Revolute 2) by rotating it by -Theta1 and adjusting for the vertical offset of Revolute 2.
3. **Planar Sub-Problem**: The remaining joints (Theta2, Theta3, Theta4) are solved using geometric relationships derived from the transformed target position. This involves solving for the angles that position the end-effector correctly, considering the link lengths and offsets from the URDF model. The solution iterates over possible angles to minimize the positional error, ensuring the target is reachable.
