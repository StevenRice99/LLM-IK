To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF robotic manipulator to reach a specified target position. The solution involves decomposing the problem into two main parts: determining the first joint angle and then solving for the remaining three angles using the transformed target position.

### Approach
1. **First Joint (Theta1)**: The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle for this joint is determined using the arctangent function to align the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane.
2. **Transformation to Revolute 2's Frame**: After determining Theta1, the target position is transformed into the coordinate system relative to the second joint (Revolute 2). This involves rotating the target position by -Theta1 and adjusting for the translation from the base to Revolute 2.
3. **Remaining Joints (Theta2, Theta3, Theta4)**: Using the transformed target position, we solve for the remaining three joints. This involves geometric calculations to handle the planar sub-problem formed by the subsequent joints and links, considering the Z-axis rotation of Revolute 3 and Y-axis rotation of Revolute 4.

### Explanation
1. **Theta1 Calculation**: The first joint angle (Theta1) is calculated using the arctangent of the target's X and Z coordinates, aligning the manipulator in the direction of the target's projection on the X-Z plane.
2. **Coordinate Transformation**: The target position is transformed into the coordinate system of the second joint (Revolute 2) by rotating it by -Theta1 and adjusting for the vertical offset of Revolute 2.
3. **Planar Sub-Problem**: The remaining joints (Theta2, Theta3, Theta4) are solved using geometric relationships derived from the transformed target position. This involves solving for the angles that position the end-effector correctly, considering the link lengths and offsets from the URDF model. The solution iterates over possible angles to minimize the positional error, ensuring the target is reachable. The correction in calculating Theta2 using `atan2(x_target, z_target)` ensures the correct alignment of the manipulator's projection in the X-Z plane of Revolute 2's frame.
