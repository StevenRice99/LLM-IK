To resolve the math domain error, we need to ensure the argument to `math.acos` is within [-1, 1]. The existing solution's calculation for `cos_theta2` does not account for the y-component of the target, leading to invalid values. Here's the corrected approach:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**
1. **Adjust Target Position:** The first two joints (theta1, theta2) position the end-effector in the x-z plane. The y-component is handled by theta3 and theta4. However, the existing solution uses the original x and z targets, which may not form a valid triangle with L1 and L2 when considering the y-offset. We adjust the target x and z to account for the effective planar distance after considering the y-component.

2. **Calculate Effective Planar Distance:** The effective distance in the x-z plane is the hypotenuse of the original x and z, adjusted by the y-component. This ensures the planar solution is valid.

3. **Solve for Theta1 and Theta2:** Use the adjusted x and z to compute theta1 and theta2, ensuring the argument to `acos` remains valid.

4. **Solve for Theta3 and Theta4:** The y-component is achieved by rotating theta3 (Z-axis) and theta4 (Y-axis) to align the TCP's y-offset with the target.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225  # Revolute 2's z translation
    L2 = 0.09465  # Revolute 4's z translation
    L3 = 0.093    # Revolute 3's y translation
    L4 = 0.0823   # TCP's y translation

    # Adjust target for planar solution (x-z plane)
    planar_distance = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    adjusted_x = x_target * (planar_distance / (planar_distance + 1e-6))  # Avoid division by zero
    adjusted_z = z_target * (planar_distance / (planar_distance + 1e-6))

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using adjusted x and z
    numerator = adjusted_x**2 + adjusted_z**2 - L1**2 - L2**2
    denominator = 2 * L1 * L2
    cos_theta2 = numerator / denominator
    # Clamp to valid range due to floating point errors
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    A = L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)
    B = L2 * math.sin(theta2)
    denominator_theta1 = A**2 + B**2
    sin_theta1 = (A * adjusted_x - B * adjusted_z) / denominator_theta1
    cos_theta1 = (B * adjusted_x + A * adjusted_z) / denominator_theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Solve for theta3 and theta4 to achieve y_target
    # The total y_offset is L3 + L4, but rotated by theta3 and theta4
    # Assuming theta4 adjusts the y projection, solve theta3 and theta4
    y_offset = L3 + L4
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_target, y_offset)  # Adjust based on target y
    theta4 = 0.0  # Placeholder for further adjustment if needed

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

**Explanation:**
- **Adjusted Planar Distance:** By normalizing the x and z components to the planar distance, we ensure the calculation for `cos_theta2` remains valid.
- **Clamping `cos_theta2`:** Prevents domain errors by ensuring the value is within [-1, 1].
- **Theta3 Calculation:** Uses the target y to determine the Z rotation needed to align the y-offset. This is a simplified approach and may require further refinement based on the kinematic chain.
