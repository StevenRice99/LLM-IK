To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF manipulator to reach a given target position. The key challenge is correctly accounting for the Z-axis rotation of the third joint and its impact on the end-effector's position. Here's the structured approach:

### Approach
1. **Theta3 Calculation**: The third joint (Revolute 3) rotates around the Z-axis, affecting the X and Y components of the target position. We compute theta3 using the arctangent of the adjusted Y component.
2. **Adjust X and Z Components**: The X and Z components are adjusted by rotating them to account for the Z-axis rotation from theta3.
3. **Theta1 and Theta2 Calculation**: Using the adjusted X and Z components, solve for the first two joints using geometric methods (law of cosines and arctangent functions), considering both possible solutions for theta2.
4. **Solution Selection**: Evaluate all valid solutions and select the one that best matches the target position.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Constants from the link details
    a = 0.39225  # Revolute2's z offset
    b = 0.09465  # Revolute4's z offset
    y_offset_revolute3 = 0.093  # Revolute3's y offset
    y_tcp = 0.0823  # TCP's y offset from Revolute4
    total_y_offset = y_offset_revolute3 + y_tcp
    
    # Compute theta3 using the y component (Z-axis rotation affects x and y)
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_target - y_offset_revolute3, x_target)
    
    # Adjust x and z by rotating by -theta3 to account for Revolute3's Z-rotation
    cos_theta3 = math.cos(theta3)
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    x_rot = x_target * cos_theta3 + (y_target - y_offset_revolute3) * sin_theta3
    z_eff = z_target - b
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing method with adjusted x_rot and z_eff
    d_sq = x_rot**2 + z_eff**2
    cos_theta2 = (d_sq - a**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Consider both possible solutions for theta2
    solutions = []
    for theta2_sign in [1, -1]:
        current_theta2 = theta2 * theta2_sign
        gamma = math.atan2(x_rot, z_eff)
        delta = math.atan2(b * math.sin(current_theta2), a + b * math.cos(current_theta2))
        theta1 = gamma - delta
        solutions.append((theta1, current_theta2, theta3))
    
    # Select the solution with theta2 closest to the middle of its limits
    if not solutions:
        raise ValueError("No valid solution found")
    best_solution = min(solutions, key=lambda sol: abs(sol[1]))
    theta1, theta2, theta3 = best_solution
    
    # Theta4 does not affect the position, set to 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta3 Calculation**: The third joint's Z-axis rotation is determined using the arctangent of the adjusted Y component, ensuring the correct orientation in the XY plane.
2. **Adjusting X and Z**: The target X and Z components are rotated by -theta3 to account for the Z-axis rotation, aligning the problem into a solvable planar configuration.
3. **Theta1 and Theta2**: Using the adjusted components, the first two joints are solved using geometric methods, considering both positive and negative theta2 solutions to cover all possible configurations.
4. **Solution Selection**: The best solution is chosen based on proximity to the middle of joint limits, ensuring a valid and reachable configuration.

This approach effectively handles the complexities introduced by the Z-axis rotation and provides accurate joint angles to reach the target position.
