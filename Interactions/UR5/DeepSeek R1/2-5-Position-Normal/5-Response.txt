To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4) for a 4-DOF manipulator to position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at a given target coordinate (x, y, z). The solution involves a detailed geometric decomposition and trigonometric calculations to account for the contributions of each joint to the TCP's position.

### Approach
1. **Solve for q3 using the Y-coordinate**: The Y-coordinate of the TCP is influenced by the third joint (q3) and fixed offsets. We use trigonometric identities to express the Y-coordinate in terms of q3 and solve for possible values of q3.
2. **Solve for q1 and q2 using X and Z coordinates**: The first two joints (q1 and q2) form a planar arm in the XZ plane. We use geometric relationships and trigonometric identities to solve for these angles based on the remaining X and Z components after accounting for q3.
3. **Check for valid solutions**: For each candidate solution of q3, we check if the derived q1 and q2 values result in the correct X and Z coordinates of the TCP.

### Explanation
1. **q3 Calculation**: The Y-coordinate is adjusted using trigonometric identities to solve for possible values of q3, considering the contributions from the third joint and fixed offsets.
2. **q1 and q2 Solution**: Using the remaining X and Z components, we solve for the planar arm formed by the first two joints. This involves geometric relationships and trigonometric identities to determine the angles that position the TCP correctly.
3. **Validation**: Each candidate solution is checked against the target coordinates to ensure accuracy, ensuring that the derived joint angles result in the correct TCP position.

This approach ensures that all joint angles are derived using a combination of geometric decomposition and trigonometric calculations, providing a closed-form solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
