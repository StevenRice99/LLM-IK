To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF serial manipulator to reach a target position and orientation. The solution involves accurately modeling the forward kinematics for both position and orientation, considering all relevant joints and their contributions.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation (Joints 1-2)**:
   - Solve θ1 and θ2 to position the end-effector correctly by considering the cumulative translations from all links, including the TCP's position after joint4.
   
2. **Orientation Calculation (Joints 3-4)**:
   - After determining θ1 and θ2, compute θ3 and θ4 to achieve the desired orientation by decomposing the rotation matrix, ensuring the correct order of rotations and accounting for the TCP's fixed orientation.

### Solution Code
```python

    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    target_roll, target_pitch, target_yaw = r

    # Compute target rotation matrix
    cr = math.cos(target_roll)
    sr = math.sin(target_roll)
    cp = math.cos(target_pitch)
    sp = math.sin(target_pitch)
    cy = math.cos(target_yaw)
    sy = math.sin(target_yaw)
    R_target = np.array([
        [cy * cp, cy * sp * sr - sy * cr, cy * sp * cr + sy * sr],
        [sy * cp, sy * sp * sr + cy * cr, sy * sp * cr - cy * sr],
        [-sp, cp * sr, cp * cr]
    ])

    # Fixed TCP rotation (90 degrees around Z)
    R_tcp = np.array([[0, -1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    R_tcp_inv = R_tcp.T

        B = 0.09465 * sin_theta2 - 0.0823 * math.cos(theta2)
        theta1 = math.atan2(x_target - B, z_target - A)

        # Compute rotation matrices for the first two joints
        R1 = np.array([
            [math.cos(theta1), 0, math.sin(theta1)],
            [0, 1, 0],

        if abs(cos_theta4) < 1e-6:
            continue  # Avoid division by zero, skip this theta2

        sin_theta3 = -R_remaining[0, 1] / cos_theta4
        cos_theta3 = R_remaining[1, 1] / cos_theta4
        theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

        # Check orientation error
        R3 = np.array([

```

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - The revised equations for θ1 and θ2 consider the cumulative translations from all links, including the TCP's position after joint4. This ensures accurate positioning by adjusting for the additional translations introduced by each joint.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - The rotation matrices for θ3 and θ4 are correctly decomposed from the remaining rotation matrix, ensuring the correct order of Z and Y rotations. This alignment ensures the end-effector's orientation matches the target.

By accurately modeling the forward kinematics and ensuring the correct decomposition of rotation matrices, this solution addresses the previous issues and provides accurate joint angles for reaching the target position and orientation.
