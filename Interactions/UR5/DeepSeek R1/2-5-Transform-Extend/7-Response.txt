To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF serial manipulator to reach a target position and orientation. The solution involves correcting the calculation of the third joint angle using the target y-coordinate and adjusting the position and orientation calculations to account for all joints.

### Approach
1. **Theta3 Calculation**: The third joint angle (theta3) is derived directly from the target y-coordinate using the geometric relationship between the joint's offset and the TCP's position.
2. **Position Calculation**: The first two joint angles (theta1 and theta2) are calculated using the target x and z coordinates, adjusted for the contributions from the third and fourth joints.
3. **Orientation Adjustment**: The target orientation is adjusted to account for the TCP's local rotation, and the fourth joint angle (theta4) is derived from the resulting rotation matrix.

### Solution Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Compute the target rotation matrix from the given orientation
    R_roll = np.array([[1, 0, 0], [0, np.cos(rx), -np.sin(rx)], [0, np.sin(rx), np.cos(rx)]])
    R_pitch = np.array([[np.cos(ry), 0, np.sin(ry)], [0, 1, 0], [-np.sin(ry), 0, np.cos(ry)]])
    R_yaw = np.array([[np.cos(rz), -np.sin(rz), 0], [np.sin(rz), np.cos(rz), 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    R_target = R_yaw @ R_pitch @ R_roll

    # Adjust for the TCP's local orientation (R_tcp_local_inv is inverse of 90-degree Z rotation)
    R_tcp_local_inv = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]])
    R_total = R_target @ R_tcp_local_inv

    # Calculate theta3 from y_target considering the third joint's offset and TCP's y
    y_offset = 0.093  # Revolute 3's y position
    tcp_y = 0.0823    # TCP's y position in link4's frame
    cos_theta3 = (y_target - y_offset) / tcp_y
    cos_theta3 = np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    # Determine the correct sign for theta3 based on the target orientation's z-component
    if R_total[2, 1] < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3

    # Parameters for the manipulator's link lengths
    A = 0.39225  # Revolute 2's z position
    B = 0.09465   # Revolute 4's z position
    C = 0.0823    # TCP's y position in link4's frame

    # Calculate the effective contribution from theta3 to x and z
    sin_theta3 = np.sin(theta3)
    term_x = C * sin_theta3
    term_z = C * np.sin(theta3)  # Adjusted based on orientation contribution

    # Calculate theta_sum using elements from the adjusted rotation matrix (R_total)
    r13 = R_total[0, 2]
    r33 = R_total[2, 2]
    theta_sum = np.arctan2(r13, r33)

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 based on the target position with theta3 contribution
    sin_S = np.sin(theta_sum)
    cos_S = np.cos(theta_sum)
    numerator_sin = x_target - B * sin_S + term_x * cos_S
    numerator_cos = z_target - B * cos_S - term_z * sin_S
    theta1 = np.arctan2(numerator_sin, numerator_cos)
    theta2 = theta_sum - theta1

    # Compute the rotation matrix after the first two joints (theta1 + theta2)
    theta_sum_current = theta1 + theta2
    cos_theta_sum = np.cos(theta_sum_current)
    sin_theta_sum = np.sin(theta_sum_current)
    R_Y_theta_sum = np.array([
        [cos_theta_sum, 0, sin_theta_sum],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-sin_theta_sum, 0, cos_theta_sum]
    ])
    R_Y_theta_sum_T = R_Y_theta_sum.T  # Transpose to invert the rotation

    # Compute the remaining rotation matrix M
    M = R_Y_theta_sum_T @ R_total

    # Solve for theta4 (Y-axis) from matrix M
    theta4 = np.arctan2(-M[2, 0], M[2, 2])

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Theta3 Calculation**: The third joint angle is derived from the target y-coordinate using the geometric relationship between the joint's offset and the TCP's position. The sign of theta3 is determined based on the orientation matrix to ensure correctness.
2. **Position Calculation**: The first two joint angles are calculated using the target x and z coordinates, adjusted for contributions from the third and fourth joints. This adjustment ensures accurate positioning by considering the geometric effects of all joints.
3. **Orientation Adjustment**: The target orientation matrix is adjusted to account for the TCP's local rotation. The fourth joint angle is derived from the decomposed rotation matrix, ensuring the correct orientation is achieved.

This approach addresses the key issues in previous solutions by accurately calculating theta3 from the y-coordinate and adjusting the position and orientation calculations to account for all joint contributions.
