To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles for a 4-DOF manipulator to reach a target position and orientation. The key insight is that the y-coordinate of the target position directly determines the third joint angle (θ₃), allowing us to decouple the problem into position and orientation components.

### Approach
1. **Calculate θ₃ from Y-Coordinate**: The y-coordinate of the target position is used to compute θ₃ using the inverse cosine function, considering both positive and negative solutions.
2. **Position Analysis**: Solve for the first two joint angles (θ₁, θ₂) using geometric inverse kinematics to position the wrist (Revolute4's origin) such that the TCP can reach the target when combined with the offset from θ₃ and θ₄.
3. **Orientation Analysis**: Determine θ₄ by aligning the robot's orientation with the target using rotation matrices derived from the remaining joint angles.

### Explanation
1. **Theta3 Calculation**: The third joint angle (θ₃) is derived from the target's y-coordinate using the inverse cosine function, considering both positive and negative solutions.
2. **Two-Link IK for Theta1 and Theta2**: The wrist position is adjusted based on the target position and the offset from θ₃ and θ₄. Geometric inverse kinematics is used to solve for the first two joint angles.
3. **Orientation Handling**: The remaining joint angle (θ₄) is determined by aligning the robot's orientation with the target using rotation matrices. The orientation matrices are computed and decomposed to extract θ₄, ensuring the solution meets both position and orientation requirements.

This approach efficiently decouples the problem, leveraging geometric and algebraic methods to find the joint angles accurately.
