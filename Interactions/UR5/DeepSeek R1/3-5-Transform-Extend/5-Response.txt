To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) for a 3-DOF serial manipulator such that the Tool Center Point (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves both position and orientation calculations for the three revolute joints, considering their interdependencies.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - **Theta2 (Joint 2)**: Calculate using the y-coordinate of the target position, considering the contribution of theta3.
   - **Theta1 (Joint 1)**: Derived from the x and z coordinates using trigonometric identities and matrix operations, adjusted for the correct sign of theta2.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - **Theta3 (Joint 3)**: After determining theta1 and theta2, compute the remaining rotation needed to achieve the target orientation using matrix transformations and extracting the angle from the resulting rotation matrix.

### Solution Code
```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    import numpy as np
    import math

    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Calculate theta2 from y-coordinate, considering the contribution of theta3
    y_offset = y - 0.093
    sin_theta3_sin_theta2 = y_offset / 0.0823
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta3_sin_theta2)  # Initial guess, adjusted later

    # Calculate theta1 using x and z coordinates
    C = 0.0823 * math.sin(theta2)
    denominator = C**2 + 0.09465**2
    c_theta1 = (0.09465 * z - C * x) / denominator
    s_theta1 = (0.09465 * x + C * z) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(s_theta1, c_theta1)

    # Compute the target rotation matrix
    def rot_x(angle):
        return np.array([
            [1, 0, 0],
            [0, math.cos(angle), -math.sin(angle)],
            [0, math.sin(angle), math.cos(angle)]
        ])
    def rot_y(angle):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(angle), 0, math.sin(angle)],
            [0, 1, 0],
            [-math.sin(angle), 0, math.cos(angle)]
        ])
    def rot_z(angle):
        return np.array([
            [math.cos(angle), -math.sin(angle), 0],
            [math.sin(angle), math.cos(angle), 0],
            [0, 0, 1]
        ])
    R_target = rot_z(rz) @ rot_y(ry) @ rot_x(rx)

    # Compute R1 and R2 matrices
    R1 = rot_y(theta1)
    R2 = rot_z(theta2)

    # Compute R_remaining to solve for theta3
    Rz_pi2 = rot_z(math.pi / 2)
    R_remaining = R2.T @ R1.T @ R_target @ Rz_pi2.T

    # Extract theta3 from R_remaining and adjust quadrant
    theta3 = math.atan2(R_remaining[0, 2], R_remaining[0, 0])

    # Adjust theta2 based on theta3 and y_offset
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    if abs(sin_theta3) > 1e-6:
        adjusted_theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta3_sin_theta2 / sin_theta3)
        theta2 = adjusted_theta2 if abs(math.sin(adjusted_theta2) - math.sin(theta2)) < 1e-6 else math.pi - adjusted_theta2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - **Theta2** is derived from the y-coordinate using the inverse sine function, adjusted for the link's offset and the contribution of theta3.
   - **Theta1** is computed using the x and z coordinates by solving a system of linear equations derived from the geometric configuration of the manipulator, considering the correct sign of theta2.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - The target orientation is converted into a rotation matrix using the provided roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
   - The remaining rotation needed after accounting for theta1 and theta2 is computed. This remaining rotation matrix is used to solve for theta3 by extracting the angle from the matrix elements, ensuring the correct orientation of the TCP.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are achieved using the calculated joint angles, leveraging trigonometric identities and matrix operations for accuracy. The adjustments in theta2 and theta3 based on the orientation and position feedback help in achieving the correct joint values.
