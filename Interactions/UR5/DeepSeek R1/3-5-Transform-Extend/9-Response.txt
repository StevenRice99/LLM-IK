To solve this problem, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) for a 3-DOF serial manipulator such that the Tool Center Point (TCP) reaches a specified position and orientation. The solution involves both position and orientation calculations for the three revolute joints, considering their interdependencies and correct trigonometric relationships.

### Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - **Theta2 (Joint 2)**: Calculate using the y-coordinate of the target position, considering both positive and negative solutions using the arccosine function.
   - **Theta1 (Joint 1)**: Derived from the x and z coordinates using trigonometric identities and matrix operations, adjusted for the correct sign of theta2.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - **Theta3 (Joint 3)**: After determining theta1 and theta2, compute the remaining rotation needed to achieve the target orientation using matrix transformations and extracting the angle from the resulting rotation matrix.

    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Calculate possible theta2 values from y-coordinate
    y_offset = y - 0.093
    cos_theta2 = y_offset / 0.0823

        # Calculate theta1 components
        sin_theta1 = (A * z - B * x) / denominator
        cos_theta1 = (A * x - B * z) / denominator

        # Normalize to handle numerical inaccuracies
        norm = math.hypot(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
        if abs(norm) < 1e-6:

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - **Theta2** is derived from the y-coordinate using the inverse cosine function, adjusted for the link's offset. Both positive and negative solutions are considered to ensure the correct quadrant.
   - **Theta1** is computed using the x and z coordinates by solving a system of linear equations derived from the geometric configuration of the manipulator, ensuring the correct trigonometric relationships.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - The target orientation is converted into a rotation matrix using the provided roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
   - The remaining rotation needed after accounting for theta1 and theta2 is computed. This remaining rotation matrix is used to solve for theta3 by extracting the angle from the matrix elements, ensuring the correct orientation of the TCP.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are achieved using the calculated joint angles, leveraging trigonometric identities and matrix operations for accuracy. The code considers multiple solutions for theta2 and selects the valid one to ensure reachability.
