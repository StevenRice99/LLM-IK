To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` with the desired orientation `r`. Given the details of the manipulator, we can break down the problem into two parts: solving for joint1 and then solving for joint2.

### Step 1: Solve for Joint1
From the existing code 1, we can see that joint1 can be solved using the `atan2` function based on the x and y coordinates of the target position. This is because joint1 rotates around the Z-axis, affecting the x and y coordinates of the TCP.

### Step 2: Solve for Joint2
After determining joint1, we can use the existing code 2 to solve for joint2. This involves calculating the angle based on the x and z coordinates of the target position, adjusted for the position of joint1.

### Implementation
We will now implement the `inverse_kinematics` function by combining these two steps. The function will first calculate joint1 using the x and y coordinates of the target position. Then, it will calculate joint2 using the x and z coordinates, adjusted for the position of joint1.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Adjust the target position for joint1
    # Since joint1 rotates around Z, we can adjust the x and y coordinates
    # by rotating the target position by -joint1
    cos_joint1 = math.cos(joint1)
    sin_joint1 = math.sin(joint1)
    x_adj = x * cos_joint1 - y * sin_joint1
    y_adj = x * sin_joint1 + y * cos_joint1
    
    # Solve for joint2
    # The adjusted x and z coordinates are used to find joint2
    joint2 = -math.atan2(-x_adj, z)
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

This function first calculates the angle for joint1 using the `atan2` function with the x and y coordinates of the target position. It then adjusts the target position by rotating it around the Z-axis by the negative of joint1 to account for the rotation caused by joint1. Finally, it calculates the angle for joint2 using the adjusted x and z coordinates.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not check for any limits on the joint angles. The function returns the calculated angles for joint1 and joint2, which can be used to position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.
