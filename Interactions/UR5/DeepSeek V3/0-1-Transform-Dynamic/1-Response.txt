To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\) with the desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine \(\theta_1\) (Joint 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the second joint relative to the first joint is influenced by \(\theta_1\).
   - We can use the `inverse_kinematics` function from **EXISTING 1** to solve for \(\theta_1\) based on the target position \(p\).

2. **Determine \(\theta_2\) (Joint 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP relative to the second joint is influenced by \(\theta_2\).
   - We can use the `inverse_kinematics` function from **EXISTING 2** to solve for \(\theta_2\) based on the target position \(p\).

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (Joint 2)
    # Adjust the target position for theta2 by considering the position of Joint 2
    # The position of Joint 2 is [0, 0.13585, 0] in the local frame of Joint 1
    # After rotating by theta1, the position of Joint 2 in the world frame is:
    # x_joint2 = 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    # y_joint2 = 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)
    # z_joint2 = 0
    
    # The vector from Joint 2 to the TCP is [0, -0.1197, 0.425] in the local frame of Joint 2
    # After rotating by theta2, the vector in the world frame is:
    # x_tcp = x_joint2 + 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    # y_tcp = y_joint2 - 0.1197 * math.cos(theta2)
    # z_tcp = 0.425 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # We can solve for theta2 by considering the position of the TCP relative to Joint 2
    # The position of the TCP relative to Joint 2 is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # We can use the atan2 function to solve for theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1), z - 0.425)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **\(\theta_1\):** We use the `atan2` function to determine the angle that aligns the first joint with the target position in the XY plane.
- **\(\theta_2\):** We adjust the target position by considering the position of the second joint and then use the `atan2` function to determine the angle that aligns the second joint with the target position in the XZ plane.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not account for joint limits or singularities.
