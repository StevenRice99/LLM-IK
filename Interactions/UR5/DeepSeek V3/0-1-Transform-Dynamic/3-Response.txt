Given the feedback, it appears that the initial approach to solving the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator was not accurate. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of joint2, which is not correctly accounting for the position and orientation of the TCP after joint1 has been applied. To address this, we need to refine the approach to ensure that both joint1 and joint2 are calculated in a way that accurately positions the TCP at the desired location and orientation.

### Revised Approach

1. **Solve for Joint1**: The initial approach to solving for joint1 using the `atan2` function with the x and y coordinates of the target position is correct. This step remains unchanged.

2. **Solve for Joint2**: The calculation for joint2 needs to be revised. Instead of using the adjusted x and z coordinates directly, we need to consider the geometry of the manipulator more carefully. Specifically, we need to account for the length of the links and the position of the TCP relative to the base after joint1 has been applied.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the position of the second joint
    # The second joint is located at [0, 0.13585, 0] relative to the first joint
    # After applying joint1, the position of the second joint in the world frame is:
    # x_joint2 = 0.13585 * math.sin(joint1)
    # y_joint2 = 0.13585 * math.cos(joint1)
    # z_joint2 = 0
    
    # The vector from the second joint to the TCP is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # After applying joint1, this vector in the world frame is:
    # x_tcp = -0.1197 * math.sin(joint1) + 0.425 * math.cos(joint1)
    # y_tcp = -0.1197 * math.cos(joint1) - 0.425 * math.sin(joint1)
    # z_tcp = 0
    
    # The total position of the TCP in the world frame is:
    # x_total = x_joint2 + x_tcp
    # y_total = y_joint2 + y_tcp
    # z_total = z_joint2 + z_tcp
    
    # However, since we already have the target position p, we can use it directly to solve for joint2
    # The distance from the second joint to the TCP is sqrt((-0.1197)^2 + (0.425)^2) = 0.441
    # Using the law of cosines, we can solve for joint2
    # Let's denote the distance from the second joint to the TCP as L = 0.441
    # The distance from the base to the TCP is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
    # The distance from the base to the second joint is 0.13585
    # Using the law of cosines:
    # L^2 = 0.13585^2 + d^2 - 2 * 0.13585 * d * cos(joint2)
    # Where d is the distance from the base to the TCP
    # Solving for joint2:
    # joint2 = acos((0.13585^2 + d^2 - L^2) / (2 * 0.13585 * d))
    
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    L = 0.441
    joint2 = math.acos((0.13585**2 + d**2 - L**2) / (2 * 0.13585 * d))
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

This revised implementation calculates joint1 using the `atan2` function with the x and y coordinates of the target position. It then calculates joint2 using the law of cosines, considering the geometry of the manipulator and the position of the TCP relative to the base after joint1 has been applied. This approach should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator.
