The feedback indicates that the initial implementation of the inverse kinematics function did not correctly solve for the joint angles to reach the desired positions and orientations. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint values suggest that the approach needs to be revised.

### Revised Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The manipulator has two revolute joints. The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, and the second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The TCP position is influenced by both joints.
2. **Correcting the Joint1 Calculation**: The initial approach used `atan2(-x, y)` for joint1, which might not account for the correct quadrant or the influence of joint2.
3. **Correcting the Joint2 Calculation**: The initial approach adjusted the target position based on joint1 and then used `atan2(-x_new, z_new)` for joint2. This might not correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator.

### Revised Implementation
We need to consider the geometry of the manipulator more carefully. The position of the TCP is determined by the lengths of the links and the angles of the joints. We can use the law of cosines to solve for the joint angles.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    length_link1 = 0.13585
    length_link2 = 0.425
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-y plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the target
    D = math.sqrt(d**2 + (z - length_link1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to calculate joint2
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - length_link1**2 - length_link2**2) / (2 * length_link1 * length_link2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    joint2 = math.atan2(z - length_link1, d) - math.atan2(length_link2 * math.sin(theta2), length_link1 + length_link2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint1 Calculation**: We use `atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle for joint1. This ensures that the angle is correctly determined based on the x and y coordinates of the target position.
2. **Distance Calculation**: We calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-y plane and the distance from the second joint to the target.
3. **Joint2 Calculation**: We use the law of cosines to calculate the angle for joint2. This involves calculating the cosine of the angle using the distances and link lengths, and then determining the angle using `acos`.

This revised approach should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator.
