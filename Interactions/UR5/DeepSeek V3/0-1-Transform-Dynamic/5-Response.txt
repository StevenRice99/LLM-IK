The error indicates that the `math.acos` function received a value outside the valid range [-1, 1], which caused a `ValueError`. This typically happens when the calculated value of `cos_theta2` is outside this range due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations.

### Revised Approach
To handle this issue, we need to ensure that the value passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range. We can clamp the value to the range [-1, 1] before passing it to `math.acos`.

### Revised Implementation
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    length_link1 = 0.13585
    length_link2 = 0.425
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-y plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the target
    D = math.sqrt(d**2 + (z - length_link1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to calculate joint2
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - length_link1**2 - length_link2**2) / (2 * length_link1 * length_link2)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(cos_theta2, 1.0))
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    joint2 = math.atan2(z - length_link1, d) - math.atan2(length_link2 * math.sin(theta2), length_link1 + length_link2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

### Explanation
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`**: We ensure that `cos_theta2` is within the valid range [-1, 1] by using `max(-1.0, min(cos_theta2, 1.0))`. This prevents the `math.acos` function from receiving an invalid input.
2. **Joint1 Calculation**: We use `atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle for joint1.
3. **Distance Calculation**: We calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-y plane and the distance from the second joint to the target.
4. **Joint2 Calculation**: We use the law of cosines to calculate the angle for joint2, ensuring that the cosine value is within the valid range before passing it to `math.acos`.

This revised approach should handle the numerical inaccuracies and provide a more robust solution for the inverse kinematics of the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator.
