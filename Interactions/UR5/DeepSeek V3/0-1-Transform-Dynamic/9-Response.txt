The feedback indicates that the revised implementation still fails to reach the desired positions and orientations. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint values suggest that the approach needs further refinement. Let's analyze the problem and adjust the solution accordingly.

### Analysis
1. **Joint1 Calculation**: The initial approach uses `atan2(y, x)` to calculate joint1. However, this might not account for the correct quadrant or the influence of joint2.
2. **Joint2 Calculation**: The initial approach uses the law of cosines to calculate joint2. However, this might not correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator, especially when the target position is close to the base or when the links are nearly aligned.

### Revised Approach
To handle these issues, we need to consider the geometry of the manipulator more carefully. We can use the following steps:
1. **Calculate Joint1**: Use `atan2(y, x)` to determine the angle for joint1.
2. **Calculate Joint2**: Use the law of cosines to determine the angle for joint2, ensuring that the cosine value is within the valid range before passing it to `math.acos`.

### Revised Implementation
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    length_link1 = 0.13585
    length_link2 = 0.425
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-y plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the target
    D = math.sqrt(d**2 + (z - length_link1)**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to calculate joint2
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - length_link1**2 - length_link2**2) / (2 * length_link1 * length_link2)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(cos_theta2, 1.0))
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    joint2 = math.atan2(z - length_link1, d) - math.atan2(length_link2 * math.sin(theta2), length_link1 + length_link2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint1 Calculation**: We use `atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle for joint1. This ensures that the angle is correctly determined based on the x and y coordinates of the target position.
2. **Distance Calculation**: We calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-y plane and the distance from the second joint to the target.
3. **Joint2 Calculation**: We use the law of cosines to calculate the angle for joint2, ensuring that the cosine value is within the valid range before passing it to `math.acos`.

This revised approach should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator.
