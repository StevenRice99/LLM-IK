To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) that will position the TCP at the desired position (p) and orientation (r). Given the forward kinematics result, we can see how the TCP position changes with joint angles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We have two revolute joints:
     - Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis.
     - Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The TCP position is influenced by both joints.

2. **Forward Kinematics Analysis:**
   - From the forward kinematics result, we can see that:
     - Joint 1 affects the X and Y coordinates.
     - Joint 2 affects the Y and Z coordinates.

3. **Inverse Kinematics for Joint 1 (θ1):**
   - The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ1.
   - We can use the `atan2` function to find θ1 based on the desired X and Y coordinates.

4. **Inverse Kinematics for Joint 2 (θ2):**
   - The position of the TCP in the YZ plane is influenced by θ2.
   - We can use the `atan2` function to find θ2 based on the desired Y and Z coordinates.

5. **Combine the Results:**
   - The final joint angles (θ1 and θ2) will be the combination of the angles calculated for each joint.

### Python Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 (joint 1) using atan2 for the XY plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (joint 2) using atan2 for the YZ plane
    # Adjust for the link length (0.13585) and the TCP offset (0.425)
    y_prime = y - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    z_prime = z - 0.425
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_prime, y_prime)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the desired X and Y coordinates. It determines the rotation around the Z-axis.
- **theta2**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the adjusted Y and Z coordinates. The adjustment accounts for the length of the second link and the TCP offset. It determines the rotation around the Y-axis.

This function will return the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) needed to position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.
