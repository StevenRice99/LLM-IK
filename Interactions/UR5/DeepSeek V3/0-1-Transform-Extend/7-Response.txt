Based on the feedback and the forward kinematics result, it appears that the initial inverse kinematics solution did not correctly account for the orientation and the interaction between the joints. Let's refine the solution by considering the orientation and the correct transformation between the joints.

### Revised Solution:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We need to find joint angles (θ1 and θ2) that position the TCP at the desired position (p) and orientation (r).

2. **Forward Kinematics Analysis:**
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by both joints.
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both joints.

3. **Inverse Kinematics for Joint 1 (θ1):**
   - The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ1.
   - We can use the `atan2` function to find θ1 based on the desired X and Y coordinates.

4. **Inverse Kinematics for Joint 2 (θ2):**
   - The position of the TCP in the YZ plane is influenced by θ2.
   - We can use the `atan2` function to find θ2 based on the desired Y and Z coordinates, adjusted for the link length and TCP offset.

5. **Combine the Results:**
   - The final joint angles (θ1 and θ2) will be the combination of the angles calculated for each joint, considering the orientation.

### Revised Python Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate theta1 (joint 1) using atan2 for the XY plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (joint 2) using atan2 for the YZ plane
    # Adjust for the link length (0.13585) and the TCP offset (0.425)
    y_prime = y - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)
    z_prime = z - 0.425
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_prime, y_prime)
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the desired orientation
    theta2 += pitch
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the desired X and Y coordinates. It determines the rotation around the Z-axis.
- **theta2**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the adjusted Y and Z coordinates. The adjustment accounts for the length of the second link and the TCP offset. It determines the rotation around the Y-axis.
- **Orientation Adjustment**: The `theta2` is further adjusted based on the desired pitch orientation.

This revised function should provide more accurate joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation.
