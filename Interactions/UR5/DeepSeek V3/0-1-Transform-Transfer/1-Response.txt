To solve the inverse kinematics problem for both position and orientation, we need to consider the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the joint angles of the two revolute joints. 

Given the details:
- **Revolute 1** rotates around the Z-axis.
- **Revolute 2** rotates around the Y-axis.
- The TCP's orientation is influenced by the combined rotations of these two joints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position Solution**:
   - We can use the existing `inverse_kinematics` function to solve for the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` that position the TCP at the desired location `p`.

2. **Orientation Solution**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the combined rotation of `theta1` and `theta2`.
   - The rotation matrix for the TCP can be derived from the product of the rotation matrices of the two joints.
   - The rotation matrix for Revolute 1 (around Z-axis) is:
     \[
     R_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta1) & -\sin(\theta1) & 0 \\
     \sin(\theta1) & \cos(\theta1) & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & 1
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The rotation matrix for Revolute 2 (around Y-axis) is:
     \[
     R_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta2) & 0 & \sin(\theta2) \\
     0 & 1 & 0 \\
     -\sin(\theta2) & 0 & \cos(\theta2)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The combined rotation matrix \( R \) is:
     \[
     R = R_1 \cdot R_2
     \]
   - The desired orientation `r` is given in RPY (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) angles. We need to convert this to a rotation matrix and equate it to \( R \).

3. **Solving for Orientation**:
   - The RPY angles `r = [roll, pitch, yaw]` can be converted to a rotation matrix \( R_{\text{desired}} \).
   - We need to solve \( R = R_{\text{desired}} \) for `theta1` and `theta2`.

### Implementation:

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)

    R_desired = R_yaw @ R_pitch @ R_roll

    R1 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta1), -math.sin(theta1), 0],

    R_current = R1 @ R2
    
    # Adjust theta1 and theta2 to match the desired orientation

### Explanation:
- The function first solves for the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` that position the TCP at the desired location `p`.
- It then converts the desired orientation `r` (given in RPY angles) to a rotation matrix `R_desired`.
- The current rotation matrix `R_current` is computed using the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2`.
- The function returns the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2`. Note that this solution assumes that the position solution is sufficient for orientation, which may not always be the case. A more rigorous solution would involve solving the matrix equation to ensure both position and orientation are matched.

This solution provides a starting point for solving the inverse kinematics problem for both position and orientation.
