To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position (x, y, z). We can use the existing solutions as a starting point and extend them to solve for all three joints.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Solve for theta1**: This is the rotation around the Z-axis of the first joint. We can use the existing code from EXISTING 1 to solve for theta1.

2. **Solve for theta2**: This is the rotation around the Y-axis of the second joint. We can use the existing code from EXISTING 2 to solve for theta2.

3. **Solve for theta3**: This is the rotation around the Y-axis of the third joint. We can use the existing code from EXISTING 4 to solve for theta3.

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using EXISTING 2
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using EXISTING 4
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position (x, y, z). The function uses the existing solutions to solve for each joint angle step by step.
