To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to extend the existing solutions to include the third joint. The existing solutions provide the values for the first and second joints, and we need to calculate the third joint value to reach the target position.

Given the target position `p = (x, y, z)`, we can use the following steps to calculate the joint values:

1. Calculate the first joint value `theta1` using the existing solution.
2. Calculate the second joint value `theta2` using the existing solution.
3. Calculate the third joint value `theta3` based on the target position and the values of the first two joints.

Let's implement this step by step:

1. **Calculate `theta1` and `theta2` using the existing solution:**

   We can use the existing solution for the first two joints to get `theta1` and `theta2`.

2. **Calculate `theta3`:**

   The third joint is responsible for adjusting the position along the z-axis. Given the target position `p = (x, y, z)`, we can calculate `theta3` as follows:

   - The position of the TCP relative to the third joint is `[0, 0, 0.39225]`.
   - The target position in the coordinate system of the third joint can be calculated by subtracting the position of the third joint from the target position.
   - The angle `theta3` can be calculated using the arctangent of the z-component of the target position relative to the third joint.

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # The position of the TCP relative to the third joint is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    # The target position in the coordinate system of the third joint is:
    x3 = x - 0.425 * sin_theta2 * cos_theta1
    y3 = y - 0.425 * sin_theta2 * sin_theta1
    z3 = z - 0.425 * cos_theta2
    
    # The angle theta3 is the arctangent of the z-component of the target position relative to the third joint
    theta3 = math.atan2(z3, math.sqrt(x3**2 + y3**2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint values `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` needed to reach the target position `p`. The function uses the existing solutions for the first two joints and extends it to calculate the third joint value.
