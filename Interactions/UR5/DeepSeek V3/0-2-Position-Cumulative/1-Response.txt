To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (theta1, theta2, theta3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position (x, y, z). We can use the existing solutions as a starting point and extend them to solve for the entire chain.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for Joint 1 (theta1):**
   - We can use the existing code 1 to solve for theta1. This code calculates theta1 based on the x and y coordinates of the target position.

2. **Solve for Joint 2 (theta2):**
   - We can use the existing code 2 to solve for theta2. This code calculates theta2 based on the z coordinate of the target position and the length of the second link.

3. **Solve for Joint 3 (theta3):**
   - We can use the existing code 4 to solve for theta3. This code calculates theta3 based on the x and z coordinates of the target position.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using existing code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using existing code 2
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using existing code 4
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:

- **theta1**: This is the angle of the first joint, calculated using the `atan2` function with the x and y coordinates of the target position.
- **theta2**: This is the angle of the second joint, calculated using the `acos` function with the z coordinate of the target position and the length of the second link (0.425).
- **theta3**: This is the angle of the third joint, calculated using the `atan2` function with the x and z coordinates of the target position.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions. The angles are returned in radians.
