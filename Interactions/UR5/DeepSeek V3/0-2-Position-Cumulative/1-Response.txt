To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \(p = (x, y, z)\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for \(\theta_1\):**
   - The first joint is a revolute joint around the Z-axis. The angle \(\theta_1\) can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XY plane and calculating the angle using the `atan2` function.
   - \(\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(-x, y)\)

2. **Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):**
   - The second and third joints are revolute joints around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from "EXISTING 4" to solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\).
   - The solution involves calculating the distance \(d\) from the origin to the target position in the XZ plane, and then using the law of cosines to find \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\).

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Check the cross product to determine the correct sign for theta2
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
- **\(\theta_1\):** This is calculated using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the XY plane.
- **\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):** These are calculated using the law of cosines and the `atan2` function to determine the angles in the XZ plane. The cross product is used to determine the correct sign for \(\theta_2\).

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions.
