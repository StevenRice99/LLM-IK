The error indicates that the value passed to `math.acos` is outside the valid range \([-1, 1]\). This can happen if the target position is not reachable or if there is an error in the calculations. Since we are assuming all targets are reachable, let's re-examine the calculations for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\).

### Step 1: Solve for \(\theta_1\)

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\)

We need to ensure that the calculations for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) are correct. Let's re-examine the approach:

1. **Calculate the position of the wrist center**:
   \[
   \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{p} - l_3 \cdot \mathbf{\hat{u}}
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{\hat{u}}\) is the unit vector in the direction of the last link.

2. **Calculate \(\theta_2\)**:
   \[
   D = \frac{r^2 + z_{\text{wrist}}^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 \cdot l_1 \cdot l_2}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \text{acos}(D)
   \]

3. **Calculate \(\theta_3\)**:
   \[
   D = \frac{r^2 + z_{\text{wrist}}^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2 - l_3^2}{2 \cdot l_2 \cdot l_3}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_3 = \text{acos}(D)
   \]

### Step 3: Implement the Inverse Kinematics Function

We will now implement the inverse kinematics function with corrected calculations.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the position of the wrist center
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the Z direction
    z_wrist = z - l3
    
    # Step 3: Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    numerator = r**2 + z_wrist**2 - l1**2 - l2**2
    denominator = 2 * l1 * l2
    D = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure D is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    if D < -1:
        D = -1
    elif D > 1:
        D = 1
    
    theta2 = math.acos(D)
    
    # Step 4: Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    numerator = r**2 + z_wrist**2 - l1**2 - l2**2 - l3**2
    denominator = 2 * l2 * l3
    D = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure D is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    if D < -1:
        D = -1
    elif D > 1:
        D = 1
    
    theta3 = math.acos(D)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Step 1**: We solve for \(\theta_1\) using the `atan2` function.
2. **Step 2**: We calculate the position of the wrist center by subtracting the length of the last link from the target position.
3. **Step 3**: We use the law of cosines to solve for \(\theta_2\), ensuring that the value passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range \([-1, 1]\).
4. **Step 4**: We use the law of cosines to solve for \(\theta_3\), ensuring that the value passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range \([-1, 1]\).

This function should now correctly return the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) needed to reach the target position \(p\).
