The error occurs because the `math.acos` function is receiving a value outside the range [-1, 1], which is not valid for the inverse cosine function. This can happen if the target position is not reachable or if there is an error in the calculation.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range. We can do this by checking the value before passing it to `math.acos` and handling any potential issues.

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function to include this check:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using EXISTING 2
    z_normalized = z / 0.425
    if z_normalized < -1.0:
        z_normalized = -1.0
    elif z_normalized > 1.0:
        z_normalized = 1.0
    theta2 = math.acos(z_normalized)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using EXISTING 4
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This updated function ensures that the value passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range [-1, 1], preventing the `ValueError` from occurring.
