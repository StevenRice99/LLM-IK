The error occurs because the `math.acos` function is receiving a value outside its valid domain of [-1, 1]. This can happen if the target position `p` is not reachable by the robot arm, but according to the instructions, we can assume that all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable. Therefore, the issue might be due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations.

Let's re-examine the calculation of `theta2`. The value passed to `math.acos` should be within the range [-1, 1]. To ensure this, we can add a check to clamp the value within this range.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2
    acos_arg = z / 0.425
    # Clamp the argument to the valid range for acos
    acos_arg = max(-1.0, min(1.0, acos_arg))
    theta2 = math.acos(acos_arg)
    
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # The position of the TCP relative to the third joint is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    # The target position in the coordinate system of the third joint is:
    x3 = x - 0.425 * sin_theta2 * cos_theta1
    y3 = y - 0.425 * sin_theta2 * sin_theta1
    z3 = z - 0.425 * cos_theta2
    
    # The angle theta3 is the arctangent of the z-component of the target position relative to the third joint
    theta3 = math.atan2(z3, math.sqrt(x3**2 + y3**2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This code ensures that the argument passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range [-1, 1] by clamping it using `max` and `min`. This should prevent the `ValueError` from occurring.
