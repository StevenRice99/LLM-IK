The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the argument to `math.acos` must be within the range [-1, 1]. If the value of `z / 0.425` is outside this range, it will cause a domain error. This can happen if the target position is not reachable by the robot arm, but according to the instructions, we can assume that all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable. Therefore, we need to ensure that the value passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range.

Let's modify the code to handle this issue:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using existing code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using existing code 2
    # Ensure the argument to acos is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    z_normalized = z / 0.425
    if z_normalized < -1:
        z_normalized = -1
    elif z_normalized > 1:
        z_normalized = 1
    theta2 = math.acos(z_normalized)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using existing code 4
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:

- **theta1**: This is the angle of the first joint, calculated using the `atan2` function with the x and y coordinates of the target position.
- **theta2**: This is the angle of the second joint, calculated using the `acos` function with the z coordinate of the target position normalized by the length of the second link (0.425). We ensure that the argument to `acos` is within the valid range [-1, 1] by clamping the value.
- **theta3**: This is the angle of the third joint, calculated using the `atan2` function with the x and z coordinates of the target position.

This modification ensures that the argument to `math.acos` is always within the valid range, preventing the `ValueError` from occurring.
