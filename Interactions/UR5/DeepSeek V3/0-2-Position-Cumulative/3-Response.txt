The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs when the argument passed to `math.acos` is outside the valid range \([-1, 1]\). This can happen if the target position is unreachable or if there is a miscalculation in the code. Since the problem states that all targets are reachable, the issue likely lies in the calculation of `cos_theta2`.

### Debugging and Fixing the Code:

1. **Check the Calculation of `cos_theta2`:**
   - The formula for `cos_theta2` is derived from the law of cosines:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 \cdot L_1 \cdot L_2}
     \]
   - If the target position is reachable, this value should always be within \([-1, 1]\). However, due to floating-point precision errors or miscalculations, it might fall outside this range.

2. **Clamp `cos_theta2` to the Valid Range:**
   - To avoid the `math domain error`, we can clamp the value of `cos_theta2` to the range \([-1, 1]\) using `min` and `max`.

### Updated Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Check the cross product to determine the correct sign for theta2
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Clamping `cos_theta2`:** The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using `max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)`. This ensures that `math.acos` does not receive an invalid input.
- **Rest of the Code:** The rest of the code remains unchanged, as it correctly calculates \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) for reachable targets.

This fix ensures that the code does not raise a `ValueError` due to invalid inputs to `math.acos`.
