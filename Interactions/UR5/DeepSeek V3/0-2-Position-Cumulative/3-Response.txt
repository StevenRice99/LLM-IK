To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \(p = [x, y, z]\).

Given the forward kinematics results, we can see the positions of each joint and the TCP. We will use the existing solutions to help us solve for the joint angles.

### Step 1: Solve for \(\theta_1\)

From the existing code 1, we can solve for \(\theta_1\) using the target position \(p = [x, y, z]\):

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, y)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\)

From the existing code 2, we can solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). However, we need to extend this to solve for \(\theta_3\) as well.

Given the positions of the joints and the TCP, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the position of the end-effector relative to the base.
2. Use the existing solutions to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
3. Use the position of the TCP to solve for \(\theta_3\).

### Step 3: Implement the Inverse Kinematics Function

We will now implement the inverse kinematics function using the above steps.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3
    # Calculate the position of the end-effector relative to the base
    # Assuming the base is at [0, 0, 0]
    # The position of the TCP is [x, y, z]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the Z direction
    z_tcp = z
    
    # Calculate theta2 and theta3 using the existing solution
    # Assuming the lengths of the links are known
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + z_tcp**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_tcp**2 - l1**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Step 1**: We solve for \(\theta_1\) using the `atan2` function, which gives us the angle in the XY plane.
2. **Step 2**: We calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the XY plane and the Z direction.
3. **Step 3**: We use the cosine rule to solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) based on the distances calculated.

This function will return the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) needed to reach the target position \(p\).
