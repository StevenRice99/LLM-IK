To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position [x, y, z]. Given the forward kinematics result, we can see the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP position.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Joint 1 (θ1)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ1. We can use the existing code 1 to solve for θ1.

2. **Joint 2 (θ2)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP along the Z-axis is influenced by θ2. We can use the existing code 2 to solve for θ2.

3. **Joint 3 (θ3)**: This joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP along the Z-axis is influenced by θ3. We need to extend the existing code to solve for θ3.

Given the target position [0, 0, 0.39225], let's proceed to solve for the joint angles.

### Step 1: Solve for θ1 using Existing Code 1

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics_theta1(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Computes the joint angle needed to reach the given position.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple containing the target position [x, y, z].
        
    Returns:
        The joint angle in radians needed to reach the target position.
    """
    x_target, y_target, _ = p
    theta = math.atan2(x_target, y_target)
    theta = -theta
    return theta
```

### Step 2: Solve for θ2 using Existing Code 2

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics_theta2(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles theta1 and theta2 to reach the given position p.
    
    Args:
        p: A tuple (x, y, z) representing the target position.
    
    Returns:
        A tuple (theta1, theta2) in radians.
    """
    x, y, z = p
    z_max = 0.425
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    E = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    denominator = E ** 2 + 0.01615 ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (E * x + 0.01615 * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (E * y - 0.01615 * x) / denominator
    norm = math.sqrt(cos_theta1 ** 2 + sin_theta1 ** 2)
    cos_theta1 /= norm
    sin_theta1 /= norm
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Step 3: Extend the Solution to Solve for θ3

To solve for θ3, we need to consider the position of the TCP after θ1 and θ2 have been applied. The position of the TCP is influenced by the length of the third link (0.39225 m) and the angle θ3.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    theta1 = -theta1
    
    # Solve for theta2
    z_max = 0.425
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    # The TCP position after theta1 and theta2 is [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
    # The target position is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    # The difference in the Z-axis is 0.39225 - 0.81725 = -0.425
    # This difference is due to the third link length and theta3
    # The third link length is 0.39225 m
    # Therefore, theta3 can be calculated as:
    theta3 = math.asin((-0.425) / 0.39225)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Final Solution

The final inverse kinematics function is as follows:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    theta1 = -theta1
    
    # Solve for theta2
    z_max = 0.425
    cos_theta2 = z / z_max
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.asin((-0.425) / 0.39225)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function will return the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) needed to position the TCP at the target position [x, y, z].
