The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions. The errors suggest that the calculations for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) are incorrect. Let's re-examine the approach and correct the calculations.

### Step 1: Solve for \(\theta_1\)

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\)

We need to ensure that the calculations for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) are correct. Let's re-examine the approach:

1. **Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the XY plane**:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the Z direction**:
   \[
   z_{\text{tcp}} = z
   \]

3. **Calculate \(\theta_2\)**:
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 + z_{\text{tcp}}^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 \cdot l_1 \cdot l_2}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \text{acos}(\cos(\theta_2))
   \]

4. **Calculate \(\theta_3\)**:
   \[
   \cos(\theta_3) = \frac{r^2 + z_{\text{tcp}}^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2 - l_3^2}{2 \cdot l_2 \cdot l_3}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_3 = \text{acos}(\cos(\theta_3))
   \]

### Step 3: Implement the Inverse Kinematics Function

We will now implement the inverse kinematics function with corrected calculations.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3
    # Calculate the position of the end-effector relative to the base
    # Assuming the base is at [0, 0, 0]
    # The position of the TCP is [x, y, z]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the Z direction
    z_tcp = z
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate theta2
    numerator = r**2 + z_tcp**2 - l1**2 - l2**2
    denominator = 2 * l1 * l2
    cos_theta2 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure cos_theta2 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    if cos_theta2 < -1:
        cos_theta2 = -1
    elif cos_theta2 > 1:
        cos_theta2 = 1
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    numerator = r**2 + z_tcp**2 - l1**2 - l2**2 - l3**2
    denominator = 2 * l2 * l3
    cos_theta3 = numerator / denominator
    
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    if cos_theta3 < -1:
        cos_theta3 = -1
    elif cos_theta3 > 1:
        cos_theta3 = 1
    
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Step 1**: We solve for \(\theta_1\) using the `atan2` function.
2. **Step 2**: We calculate the distance from the base to the TCP in the XY plane and the Z direction.
3. **Step 3**: We use the cosine rule to solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\), ensuring that the values passed to `math.acos` are within the valid range \([-1, 1]\).

This function should now correctly return the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) needed to reach the target position \(p\).
