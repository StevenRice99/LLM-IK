To ensure that the inverse kinematics function returns the correct number of joint angles, let's revise the function to correctly compute all three joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3). We will use the existing solutions and extend them to include the third joint.

### Revised Solution

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    # The position of the second joint is [0, 0.13585, 0]
    # The position of the third joint is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # The position of the TCP is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the TCP
    dx = x - 0
    dy = y - 0.13585
    dz = z - 0
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the third joint
    d2 = 0.425
    
    # Distance from the third joint to the TCP
    d3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the TCP
    D = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - d2**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d2**2 + d3**2 - D**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ1 (Joint 1)**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the XY plane.
2. **θ2 (Joint 2)**: This is calculated using the law of cosines to determine the angle between the second and third joints.
3. **θ3 (Joint 3)**: This is also calculated using the law of cosines to determine the angle between the third joint and the TCP.

This revised function should now correctly return the three joint angles needed to position the TCP at the target position [x, y, z].
