The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the target positions. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint values suggest that the approach needs further refinement.

To address this, we need to consider the full kinematic chain and ensure that the calculations for each joint angle are correctly accounting for the positions and orientations of all links. Let's re-examine the problem and derive the correct joint angles step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate `theta1` (Joint 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle `theta1` can be calculated using the arctangent of the y and x coordinates of the target position.

2. **Calculate `theta2` (Joint 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle `theta2` can be calculated using the arctangent of the z coordinate and the distance in the x-y plane.

3. **Calculate `theta3` (Joint 3):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle `theta3` can be calculated based on the remaining distance to the target position after accounting for the first two joints.

Let's implement this step-by-step approach in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the x-y plane
    d_xy = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # The second joint is at [0, 0.13585, 0]
    # The third joint is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the third joint
    # The total length from the second joint to the TCP is 0.425 + 0.39225 = 0.81725
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = math.sqrt(d_xy**2 + z**2)
    cos_theta2 = (a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # Using the law of cosines again to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **`theta1` Calculation:**
   - The angle `theta1` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in the x-y plane.

2. **`theta2` Calculation:**
   - The distance `d_xy` in the x-y plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
   - The law of cosines is used to find `theta2` based on the lengths of the links and the distance to the target.

3. **`theta3` Calculation:**
   - The law of cosines is used again to find `theta3` based on the lengths of the links and the distance to the target.

This approach ensures that all joint angles are correctly calculated to reach the target position. The clamping of the cosine values ensures that the arguments to `math.acos` are within the valid range [-1, 1], preventing any domain errors.
