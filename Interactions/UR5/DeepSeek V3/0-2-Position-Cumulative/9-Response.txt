Given the feedback, it's clear that the current approach to solving the inverse kinematics is not sufficient. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\). Let's re-examine the problem and try a different approach.

### Step 1: Solve for \(\theta_1\)

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\)

We need to consider the geometry of the robot arm more carefully. The robot arm consists of three revolute joints, and we need to find the angles \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) such that the end-effector reaches the target position.

Let's denote:
- \(l_1 = 0.13585\) (length of the first link)
- \(l_2 = 0.425\) (length of the second link)
- \(l_3 = 0.39225\) (length of the third link)

The position of the end-effector relative to the base can be expressed as:
\[
\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix}
\]

We can express the position of the end-effector in terms of the joint angles:
\[
\mathbf{p} = \begin{bmatrix}
l_1 \cos(\theta_1) + l_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + l_3 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3) \\
l_1 \sin(\theta_1) + l_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + l_3 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2 + \theta_3) \\
0
\end{bmatrix}
\]

However, this approach is complex and may not be the best way to solve the problem. Instead, let's use a geometric approach.

### Step 3: Geometric Approach

1. **Calculate the position of the wrist center**:
   The wrist center is the point where the last two links meet. We can calculate its position by subtracting the length of the last link from the target position:
   \[
   \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{p} - l_3 \cdot \mathbf{\hat{u}}
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{\hat{u}}\) is the unit vector in the direction of the last link.

2. **Calculate \(\theta_2\)**:
   The angle \(\theta_2\) can be found using the law of cosines in the triangle formed by the first two links and the line from the base to the wrist center.

3. **Calculate \(\theta_3\)**:
   The angle \(\theta_3\) can be found using the law of cosines in the triangle formed by the last two links and the line from the wrist center to the target position.

### Step 4: Implement the Inverse Kinematics Function

We will now implement the inverse kinematics function using the geometric approach.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the position of the wrist center
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the XY plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the wrist center in the Z direction
    z_wrist = z - l3
    
    # Step 3: Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    D = (r**2 + z_wrist**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(D)
    
    # Step 4: Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    D = (r**2 + z_wrist**2 - l1**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = math.acos(D)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Step 1**: We solve for \(\theta_1\) using the `atan2` function.
2. **Step 2**: We calculate the position of the wrist center by subtracting the length of the last link from the target position.
3. **Step 3**: We use the law of cosines to solve for \(\theta_2\).
4. **Step 4**: We use the law of cosines to solve for \(\theta_3\).

This function should now correctly return the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) needed to reach the target position \(p\).
