The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions. The errors suggest that the approach needs to be revised to correctly handle the kinematics of the 3-DOF manipulator.

To address this, we need to consider the geometry and the relationships between the joints more carefully. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Solve for theta1**: This is the rotation around the Z-axis of the first joint. We can use the existing code from EXISTING 1 to solve for theta1.

2. **Solve for theta2 and theta3**: These are the rotations around the Y-axis of the second and third joints. We need to consider the geometry of the manipulator to solve for these angles.

Let's implement a revised version of the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Distance from the origin to the target in the XY plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the geometry of the manipulator
    # The lengths of the links are 0.13585 and 0.425
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    
    # The target position in the plane of the second and third links
    z_target = z - l1
    d_target = math.sqrt(d**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d_target**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    alpha = math.atan2(z_target, d)
    beta = math.asin((l2 * math.sin(theta3)) / d_target)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This revised function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position (x, y, z). The function uses the geometry of the manipulator to solve for the joint angles step by step. It also includes a check to ensure that the value passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range [-1, 1].

However, given the feedback, it seems that the current approach is still not sufficient. Let's try a different approach by using the existing code from EXISTING 2 and EXISTING 4 to solve for theta2 and theta3.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using EXISTING 2 and EXISTING 4
    # First, solve for theta2 using EXISTING 2
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # Then, solve for theta3 using EXISTING 4
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This approach uses the existing solutions to solve for theta2 and theta3. Let's see if this resolves the issues.
