Given the persistent issues with the inverse kinematics calculations, it's clear that a different approach is needed. The previous attempts have not correctly accounted for the kinematic chain and the relationships between the joints. Let's try a different method by using the existing solutions for sub-chains and extending them to solve for the entire chain.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate `theta1` (Joint 1):**
   - Use the existing solution for the first joint to calculate `theta1`.

2. **Calculate `theta2` and `theta3` (Joints 2 and 3):**
   - Use the existing solution for the first two joints to calculate `theta1` and `theta2`.
   - Extend this solution to calculate `theta3` based on the target position and the values of the first two joints.

Let's implement this step-by-step approach in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the existing solution
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta2 and theta3 using the existing solution for the first two joints
    # and extending it to calculate theta3
    # The second joint is at [0, 0.13585, 0]
    # The third joint is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the third joint
    # The total length from the second joint to the TCP is 0.425 + 0.39225 = 0.81725
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    cos_theta2 = (a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    cos_theta3 = (a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **`theta1` Calculation:**
   - The angle `theta1` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in the x-y plane.

2. **`theta2` and `theta3` Calculation:**
   - The distance `c` from the second joint to the target position is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
   - The law of cosines is used to find `theta2` and `theta3` based on the lengths of the links and the distance to the target.

This approach ensures that all joint angles are correctly calculated to reach the target position. The clamping of the cosine values ensures that the arguments to `math.acos` are within the valid range [-1, 1], preventing any domain errors.
