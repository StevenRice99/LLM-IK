The error indicates that the `math.acos` function is receiving a value outside the valid range [-1, 1], which can happen due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations. Let's revise the function to ensure that the values passed to `math.acos` are within the valid range.

### Revised Solution

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    # The position of the second joint is [0, 0.13585, 0]
    # The position of the third joint is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # The position of the TCP is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the TCP
    dx = x - 0
    dy = y - 0.13585
    dz = z - 0
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the third joint
    d2 = 0.425
    
    # Distance from the third joint to the TCP
    d3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the TCP
    D = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2 + dz**2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within the valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - d2**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Ensure the value is within the valid range for acos
    cos_theta3 = (d2**2 + d3**2 - D**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ1 (Joint 1)**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the XY plane.
2. **θ2 (Joint 2)**: This is calculated using the law of cosines to determine the angle between the second and third joints. The value is clamped to the range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors.
3. **θ3 (Joint 3)**: This is also calculated using the law of cosines to determine the angle between the third joint and the TCP. The value is clamped to the range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors.

This revised function should now correctly handle numerical inaccuracies and return the three joint angles needed to position the TCP at the target position [x, y, z].
