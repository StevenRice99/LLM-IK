To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we can break down the problem into two main steps:

1. **Solve for the first joint (Revolute 1)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis, and its angle can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the XY plane.
2. **Solve for the second and third joints (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3)**: These joints rotate around the Y-axis, and their angles can be determined by the position of the target relative to the second joint.

We can use the existing functions to help us solve these steps. First, we will use `EXISTING 1` to solve for the first joint, and then we will use `EXISTING 2` to solve for the second and third joints.

Here is the completed `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for the first joint (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target position to the coordinate system of the second joint
    # The second joint is located at [0, 0.13585, 0] relative to the first joint
    # We need to rotate the target position by -theta1 around the Z-axis to align it with the second joint's coordinate system
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_transformed = x * cos_theta1 + y * sin_theta1
    y_transformed = -x * sin_theta1 + y * cos_theta1 - 0.13585
    z_transformed = z
    
    # Step 3: Solve for the second and third joints (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3)
    theta2, theta3 = inverse_kinematics_joints_2_3((x_transformed, y_transformed, z_transformed))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)

def inverse_kinematics_joints_2_3(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" for the second and third joints.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Step 1**: We calculate `theta1` using the `atan2` function to determine the angle of the first joint based on the target position's projection onto the XY plane.
2. **Step 2**: We transform the target position to the coordinate system of the second joint by rotating it by `-theta1` around the Z-axis and adjusting for the offset of the second joint.
3. **Step 3**: We use the `inverse_kinematics_joints_2_3` function to solve for `theta2` and `theta3` based on the transformed target position.

This approach ensures that we correctly solve for all three joint angles to reach the target position.
