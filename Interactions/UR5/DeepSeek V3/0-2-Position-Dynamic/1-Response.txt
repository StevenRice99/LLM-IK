To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position (x, y, z). We can use the existing solutions as a starting point and extend them to solve for the entire chain.

### Step 1: Solve for θ1
From the existing code 1, we can solve for θ1 using the target position (x, y, z). The function calculates θ1 as the angle between the x and y coordinates of the target position.

### Step 2: Solve for θ3
From the existing code 2, we can solve for θ3 using the target position (x, y, z). The function calculates θ3 as the angle between the x and z coordinates of the target position.

### Step 3: Solve for θ2
To solve for θ2, we need to consider the geometry of the manipulator. The position of the TCP is influenced by the lengths of the links and the angles θ1, θ2, and θ3. We can use the law of cosines to find θ2.

### Step 4: Combine the solutions
We will combine the solutions for θ1, θ2, and θ3 to form the complete inverse kinematics solution.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ1 using existing code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)
    theta1 = -theta1
    
    # Solve for θ3 using existing code 2
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ2 using the law of cosines
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Distance from the base to the target in the x-z plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find θ2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 required to position the TCP at the target position (x, y, z). The function uses the existing solutions for θ1 and θ3 and extends them to solve for θ2 using the law of cosines.
