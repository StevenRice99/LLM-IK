Given the persistent issues with the inverse kinematics solution, it's clear that a more robust and accurate method is required. The current approach using the law of cosines and sines is not sufficient to handle all target positions correctly. To address this, we need to consider a more comprehensive geometric approach that accounts for the full configuration of the manipulator.

### Revised Approach

1. **Solve for θ1**: The first joint angle (θ1) can be determined by the position of the target in the x-y plane. This can be calculated using the `atan2` function.

2. **Solve for θ2 and θ3**: The second and third joint angles (θ2 and θ3) can be determined by considering the geometry of the manipulator in the plane defined by the first joint. This involves using the law of cosines and the law of sines to solve for the angles, but with more careful consideration of the manipulator's configuration.

### Updated Function

Here is the updated function that incorporates these considerations:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Project the target position onto the x-z plane relative to the first joint
    x_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - l1
    z_proj = z
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the target in the x-z plane
    d = math.sqrt(x_proj**2 + z_proj**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find θ3
    cos_theta3 = (l2**2 + l3**2 - d**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)  # Ensure within valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Using the law of sines to find θ2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_proj, x_proj)
    beta = math.asin((l3 * math.sin(theta3)) / d)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ1 Calculation**: The angle θ1 is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle between the x-axis and the line from the origin to the point (x, y).

2. **Projection**: The target position is projected onto the x-z plane relative to the first joint. This gives us the coordinates (x_proj, z_proj).

3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance `d` from the second joint to the target in the x-z plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

4. **θ3 Calculation**: The angle θ3 is calculated using the law of cosines. The value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] to ensure it is within the valid range for the `acos` function.

5. **θ2 Calculation**: The angle θ2 is calculated using the law of sines. The angle `alpha` is the angle between the x-axis and the line from the second joint to the target. The angle `beta` is the angle between the line from the second joint to the target and the line from the second joint to the third joint.

This updated function should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics problem. However, further testing and refinement may be necessary to ensure it works correctly for all target positions.
