Given the feedback and the correct joint values, it's clear that the previous approach was not correctly solving the inverse kinematics problem. Let's re-examine the problem and develop a new solution.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Manipulator Structure:**
   - The manipulator has three revolute joints with specific positions and orientations.
   - The TCP position is influenced by all three joints.

2. **Use Existing Solutions:**
   - The existing solutions provided can be used to solve for sub-chains of the manipulator.

3. **Combine Solutions:**
   - Use the existing solutions to solve for the first two joints and then adjust for the third joint.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust z for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target position in the x-y plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the target position
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_adjusted**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (0.425**2 + d**2 - 0.13585**2) / (2 * 0.425 * d)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2) - math.atan2(z_adjusted, r)
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (0.425**2 + 0.13585**2 - d**2) / (2 * 0.425 * 0.13585)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Adjust z for the TCP Offset:**
   - The z-coordinate is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset (0.39225).

2. **Calculate the Distance in the x-y Plane:**
   - The distance `r` from the base to the target position in the x-y plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Calculate theta1:**
   - The angle theta1 is calculated using `math.atan2`.

4. **Calculate the Distance from the Second Joint to the Target Position:**
   - The distance `d` from the second joint to the target position is calculated.

5. **Calculate theta2:**
   - The angle theta2 is calculated using the law of cosines and adjusted by the angle to the target position.

6. **Calculate theta3:**
   - The angle theta3 is calculated using the law of cosines and adjusted by `math.pi`.

This revised solution should correctly calculate the joint angles for the given position.
