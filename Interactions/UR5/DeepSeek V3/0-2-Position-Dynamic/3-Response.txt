The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the argument to `math.acos` is outside the range [-1, 1]. This can happen if the target position is not reachable or if there is an error in the calculation.

Let's re-examine the code and ensure that the calculations are correct and that the target position is reachable.

### Revised Solution

1. **Check the Reachability:**
   - Ensure that the target position is within the reachable workspace of the manipulator.

2. **Adjust the Calculation for theta2:**
   - The calculation for theta2 should ensure that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range.

3. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where the target position is at the boundary of the workspace.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust z for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target position in the x-y plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target position in 3D space
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_adjusted**2)
    
    # Check if the target position is reachable
    if d > 0.425 + 0.13585 or d < abs(0.425 - 0.13585):
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (0.425**2 + 0.13585**2 - d**2) / (2 * 0.425 * 0.13585)
    if cos_theta2 < -1 or cos_theta2 > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_adjusted, r)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Adjust z for the TCP Offset:**
   - The z-coordinate is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset (0.39225).

2. **Calculate the Distance in the x-y Plane:**
   - The distance `r` from the base to the target position in the x-y plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Calculate the 3D Distance:**
   - The distance `d` from the base to the target position in 3D space is calculated.

4. **Check Reachability:**
   - The target position is checked to ensure it is within the reachable workspace of the manipulator.

5. **Calculate theta2:**
   - The angle theta2 is calculated using the law of cosines. The argument to `math.acos` is checked to ensure it is within the valid range.

6. **Calculate theta1 and theta3:**
   - The angles theta1 and theta3 are calculated using `math.atan2`.

This revised solution ensures that the target position is reachable and handles edge cases appropriately.
