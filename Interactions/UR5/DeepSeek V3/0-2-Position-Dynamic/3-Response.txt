The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs when the argument to `math.acos` is outside the range [-1, 1]. This can happen if the target position is not reachable, but since we are assuming all targets are reachable, the issue might be due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations.

Let's re-examine the calculations for θ2 and θ3 to ensure they are correct and handle any potential numerical inaccuracies.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint1 (θ1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Transform the target position to the coordinate system of joint2
    # The position of joint2 is [0, 0.13585, 0]
    # The position of joint3 is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    # The position of TCP is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    
    # Calculate the position of the TCP relative to joint2
    # The vector from joint2 to TCP is [0, -0.1197, 0.425] + [0, 0, 0.39225] = [0, -0.1197, 0.81725]
    # We need to rotate this vector by -θ1 around the Z-axis to get it into the joint2 coordinate system
    # The rotation matrix around Z-axis is:
    # [cos(θ1), -sin(θ1), 0]
    # [sin(θ1), cos(θ1), 0]
    # [0, 0, 1]
    
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Rotate the vector [0, -0.1197, 0.81725] by -θ1
    x_rot = 0 * cos_theta1 - (-0.1197) * sin_theta1
    y_rot = 0 * sin_theta1 + (-0.1197) * cos_theta1
    z_rot = 0.81725
    
    # Now, we have the position of the TCP relative to joint2 in the joint2 coordinate system
    # We can now solve for θ2 and θ3 using the lengths of the links
    # The length from joint2 to joint3 is 0.425
    # The length from joint3 to TCP is 0.39225
    
    # The distance from joint2 to TCP is sqrt(x_rot^2 + y_rot^2 + z_rot^2)
    distance = math.sqrt(x_rot**2 + y_rot**2 + z_rot**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to solve for θ3
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    c = distance
    
    # Ensure the argument to acos is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = (a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)  # Clamp to valid range
    
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Using the law of sines to solve for θ2
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    theta2 = math.asin((b * sin_theta3) / c)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation

1. **Clamping `cos_theta3`:**
   - We ensure that `cos_theta3` is within the valid range [-1, 1] by using `max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)`. This prevents the `math.acos` function from receiving an invalid argument.

2. **Numerical Stability:**
   - The clamping step ensures that even if there are minor numerical inaccuracies, the argument to `math.acos` remains valid.

This revised implementation should handle the numerical inaccuracies and prevent the `ValueError: math domain error` from occurring.
