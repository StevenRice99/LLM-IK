To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired location. Given the forward kinematics result, we can see that the TCP is positioned at `[0, 0.016149999999999998, 0.81725]` when all joint angles are set to `0`.

However, the target position provided is `[0, 0, 0.39225]`. To reach this position, we need to adjust the joint angles accordingly. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the required change in position
The target position is `[0, 0, 0.39225]`, and the current position is `[0, 0.016149999999999998, 0.81725]`. The required change in position is:
```
delta_x = 0 - 0 = 0
delta_y = 0 - 0.016149999999999998 = -0.016149999999999998
delta_z = 0.39225 - 0.81725 = -0.425
```

### Step 2: Determine the joint angles
We need to find the joint angles that will result in the TCP moving by `[0, -0.016149999999999998, -0.425]`.

Given the structure of the manipulator:
- Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis.
- Joint 2 rotates around the Y-axis.
- Joint 3 rotates around the Y-axis.

We can use the existing code provided in `EXISTING 1` to solve for joints 1 and 2, and then adjust joint 3 to achieve the desired position.

### Step 3: Use existing code to solve for joints 1 and 2
The existing code in `EXISTING 1` solves for joints 1 and 2 given a target position. We can use this to find the angles for joints 1 and 2.

### Step 4: Adjust joint 3
After solving for joints 1 and 2, we need to adjust joint 3 to achieve the final position. Since joint 3 also rotates around the Y-axis, we can calculate the required angle based on the remaining change in position.

### Step 5: Implement the solution
Let's implement the solution step by step.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the required change in position
    delta_x = x - 0
    delta_y = y - 0.016149999999999998
    delta_z = z - 0.81725
    
    # Use existing code to solve for joints 1 and 2
    theta2 = math.acos(delta_z / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * delta_x + L * delta_y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * delta_x + K * delta_y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Adjust joint 3 to achieve the final position
    theta3 = math.atan2(delta_y, delta_z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles to reach the target position `[0, 0, 0.39225]`. The function uses the existing code to solve for joints 1 and 2 and then adjusts joint 3 to achieve the final position.
