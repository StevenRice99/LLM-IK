The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions. The errors suggest that the approach to solving for θ2 using the law of cosines may not be sufficient or correctly applied in this context. Additionally, the solutions for θ1 and θ3 may need to be revisited to ensure they are correctly calculated.

Given the complexity of the problem and the feedback, it's clear that a more comprehensive approach is needed. This involves considering the full geometry of the manipulator and possibly using a different method to solve for the joint angles.

However, since the instructions specify not to use optimization methods and to assume all targets are reachable, we need to refine our approach within these constraints. Let's attempt to adjust the function by re-evaluating the calculation of θ2 and ensuring that the solutions for θ1 and θ3 are correctly applied.

Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ1 using existing code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ3 using existing code 2
    # Adjust the calculation to consider the correct plane and link lengths
    # Assuming l1 is the length from the base to the second joint
    l1 = 0.13585
    l2 = 0.425
    l3 = 0.39225
    
    # Project the target position onto the x-z plane relative to the first joint
    x_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - l1
    z_proj = z
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the target in the x-z plane
    d = math.sqrt(x_proj**2 + z_proj**2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find θ3
    cos_theta3 = (l2**2 + l3**2 - d**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)  # Ensure within valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Solve for θ2 using the law of sines
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_proj, x_proj) - math.atan2(l3 * sin_theta3, l2 + l3 * cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This updated function attempts to more accurately solve for θ2 and θ3 by considering the projection of the target position onto the x-z plane relative to the first joint and using both the law of cosines and the law of sines. The calculation of θ1 remains based on the existing code 1 but is adjusted to use `math.atan2(y, x)` for a more straightforward calculation.

Please note that this is a complex problem, and further adjustments may be necessary based on additional testing and feedback. The goal is to iteratively refine the solution until it accurately reaches all target positions.
