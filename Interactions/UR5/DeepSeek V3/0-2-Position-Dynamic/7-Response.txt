The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the argument to `math.acos` is outside the range [-1, 1]. This can happen due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations. To address this, we need to ensure that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range.

### Revised Solution

1. **Clamp the Argument to `math.acos`:**
   - Ensure that the argument to `math.acos` is within the range [-1, 1] by clamping it.

2. **Adjust the Calculation for theta2:**
   - Ensure that the calculation for theta2 is correct and does not result in a domain error.

3. **Calculate theta1 and theta3:**
   - Ensure that the calculations for theta1 and theta3 are correct.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust z for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target position in the x-y plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate the argument for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + z_adjusted**2 - 0.425**2 - 0.13585**2) / (2 * 0.425 * 0.13585)
    
    # Clamp the value to the valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_adjusted, r)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Adjust z for the TCP Offset:**
   - The z-coordinate is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset (0.39225).

2. **Calculate the Distance in the x-y Plane:**
   - The distance `r` from the base to the target position in the x-y plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Calculate the Argument for theta2:**
   - The argument for theta2 is calculated using the law of cosines. The argument is clamped to the range [-1, 1] to ensure it is within the valid range for `math.acos`.

4. **Calculate theta2:**
   - The angle theta2 is calculated using `math.acos`.

5. **Calculate theta1 and theta3:**
   - The angles theta1 and theta3 are calculated using `math.atan2`.

This revised solution ensures that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range and correctly calculates the joint angles for the given position.
