The error indicates that the argument to `math.acos` is outside the valid range `[-1, 1]`. This can happen if the value of `delta_z / 0.425` is outside this range. Let's ensure that the value is within the valid range before calling `math.acos`.

### Step 1: Check the value of `delta_z / 0.425`
We need to ensure that the value of `delta_z / 0.425` is within the range `[-1, 1]`. If it is not, we need to handle it appropriately.

### Step 2: Handle the case when the value is outside the range
If the value is outside the range, we can clamp it to the nearest valid value.

### Step 3: Update the code
Let's update the code to handle this case.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate the required change in position
    delta_x = x - 0
    delta_y = y - 0.016149999999999998
    delta_z = z - 0.81725
    
    # Ensure delta_z / 0.425 is within the valid range for acos
    acos_arg = delta_z / 0.425
    if acos_arg > 1:
        acos_arg = 1
    elif acos_arg < -1:
        acos_arg = -1
    
    # Use existing code to solve for joints 1 and 2
    theta2 = math.acos(acos_arg)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * delta_x + L * delta_y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * delta_x + K * delta_y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Adjust joint 3 to achieve the final position
    theta3 = math.atan2(delta_y, delta_z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This updated code ensures that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range `[-1, 1]` by clamping the value if necessary. This should prevent the `ValueError` from occurring.
