The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions. The provided correct joint values suggest that the solution requires a more comprehensive approach, considering the full kinematic chain and the constraints of each joint.

### Step 1: Analyze the Correct Joint Values
The correct joint values provided in the feedback show that the solution involves a combination of positive and negative angles, and some angles are outside the typical `[0, 2π]` range. This suggests that the solution needs to consider multiple configurations and handle the joint limits appropriately.

### Step 2: Re-evaluate the Approach
The current approach uses a simplified method to solve for the joint angles, which does not account for the full kinematic chain and the constraints of each joint. We need to implement a more robust solution that considers the full kinematic chain and handles the joint limits.

### Step 3: Implement a Comprehensive Solution
Let's implement a more comprehensive solution that considers the full kinematic chain and handles the joint limits.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the position of the end effector relative to the base
    target_x = x
    target_y = y
    target_z = z - L1
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target position in the XY plane
    d = math.sqrt(target_x**2 + target_y**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 1 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(target_y, target_x)
    
    # Calculate the distance from joint 2 to the target position in the XZ plane
    D = math.sqrt(d**2 + (target_z - L1)**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 2 (rotation around Y-axis)
    cos_theta2 = (L2**2 + D**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * D)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2) - math.atan2(target_z - L1, d)
    
    # Calculate the angle for joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis)
    cos_theta3 = (L2**2 + L3**2 - D**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Step 4: Explanation
1. **Link Lengths**: We define the lengths of the links based on the provided URDF.
2. **Target Position**: We adjust the target position to account for the base height.
3. **Distance Calculation**: We calculate the distance from the base to the target position in the XY plane and the XZ plane.
4. **Joint Angles**:
   - **Theta1**: Calculated using `atan2` to determine the rotation around the Z-axis.
   - **Theta2**: Calculated using the law of cosines to determine the rotation around the Y-axis.
   - **Theta3**: Calculated using the law of cosines to determine the rotation around the Y-axis, adjusted by `π` to account for the link orientation.

This solution should provide a more accurate and robust inverse kinematics solution for the given manipulator.
