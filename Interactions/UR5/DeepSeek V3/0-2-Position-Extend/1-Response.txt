To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to extend the existing solution for the first two links to include the third link. The third link introduces an additional degree of freedom, which affects the position of the TCP.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Existing Solution:**
   - The existing solution calculates the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` for the first two links to reach a given position `p = (x_d, y_d, z_d)`.
   - The third link is not considered in the existing solution.

2. **Extend the Solution to Include the Third Link:**
   - The third link has a length of `0.39225` meters along the Z-axis in its local frame.
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by the rotation of the third link around the Y-axis (`theta3`).

3. **Calculate the Position of the Third Link:**
   - The position of the third link in world coordinates can be calculated using the forward kinematics of the first two links.
   - The TCP position is then calculated by adding the offset due to the third link.

4. **Solve for `theta3`:**
   - The third link's rotation affects the Z-coordinate of the TCP.
   - We can solve for `theta3` by considering the Z-coordinate of the target position.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution
    cos_theta2 = (z_d - 0.39225) / 0.425
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    # The third link's rotation affects the Z-coordinate of the TCP
    # Since the third link rotates around the Y-axis, it affects the X and Z coordinates
    # However, in this case, the third link's rotation only affects the Z-coordinate
    # Therefore, theta3 can be calculated based on the Z-coordinate of the target position
    theta3 = math.asin((z_d - 0.39225) / 0.425)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
- **`theta1` and `theta2`:** These are calculated using the existing solution, but adjusted to account for the TCP offset.
- **`theta3`:** This is calculated based on the Z-coordinate of the target position, considering the length of the third link.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not check for joint limits or singularities.
