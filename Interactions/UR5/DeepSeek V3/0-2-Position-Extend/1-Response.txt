To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to extend the existing solution to include the third joint. The existing solution solves for the first two joints (theta1 and theta2) to reach a position in the x-y plane. We need to add the third joint (theta3) to reach the desired z-coordinate.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate theta2**: This is the angle for the second joint, which is already calculated in the existing solution.
2. **Calculate theta1**: This is the angle for the first joint, which is also calculated in the existing solution.
3. **Calculate theta3**: This is the angle for the third joint, which we need to calculate to reach the desired z-coordinate.

Given the position of the TCP and the lengths of the links, we can calculate theta3 using the following steps:

- The position of the TCP relative to the third joint is given by the vector [0, 0, 0.39225].
- The position of the third joint relative to the second joint is given by the vector [0, -0.1197, 0.425].
- The total z-coordinate is the sum of the z-coordinates of these vectors.

Let's complete the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos((z - 0.39225) / 0.425)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1), x - 0.13585 * math.cos(theta1)) - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles theta1, theta2, and theta3 required to reach the desired position `p`. The calculations are based on the geometry of the manipulator and the given link lengths and positions.
