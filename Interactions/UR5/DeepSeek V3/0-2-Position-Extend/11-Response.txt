Given the feedback and the forward kinematics results, it's clear that the current inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the desired positions. The discrepancies between the expected and actual positions indicate that the mathematical model used in the inverse kinematics function is not accurately representing the manipulator's geometry.

To address this, let's re-examine the approach and adjust the calculations based on the forward kinematics results. The forward kinematics show that the TCP position is influenced by the positions and orientations of all three joints. Therefore, the inverse kinematics solution must accurately account for the contributions of each joint to the TCP position.

Here's a revised approach:

1. **Calculate theta2**:
   - The z-coordinate is influenced by both the second and third joints.
   - The effective length in the z-direction is `0.425 * sin(theta2) + 0.39225`.
   - Therefore, we need to solve for `theta2` in the equation: `z = 0.425 * sin(theta2) + 0.39225`.
   - Rearranging, we get `sin(theta2) = (z - 0.39225) / 0.425`.

2. **Calculate theta1**:
   - The x and y coordinates are influenced by the first and second joints.
   - We need to solve for `theta1` using the x and y coordinates, considering the effect of `theta2`.

3. **Calculate theta3**:
   - The third joint affects the y-coordinate.
   - We need to solve for `theta3` using the y-coordinate, considering the effect of `theta1` and `theta2`.

Given the complexity, let's use the forward kinematics results to guide the inverse kinematics calculations. We'll adjust the calculations to ensure they align with the forward kinematics results.

Here's the revised `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta2
    sin_theta2 = (z - 0.39225) / 0.425
    if sin_theta2 < -1:
        sin_theta2 = -1
    elif sin_theta2 > 1:
        sin_theta2 = 1
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * cos_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    sin_theta1_plus_theta3 = (y - 0.13585 * math.sin(theta1)) / 0.1197
    if sin_theta1_plus_theta3 < -1:
        sin_theta1_plus_theta3 = -1
    elif sin_theta1_plus_theta3 > 1:
        sin_theta1_plus_theta3 = 1
    theta3 = math.asin(sin_theta1_plus_theta3) - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This revised function should now correctly calculate the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` required to reach the desired position `p`. The calculations are adjusted to align with the forward kinematics results, ensuring that the inverse kinematics solution accurately represents the manipulator's geometry.
