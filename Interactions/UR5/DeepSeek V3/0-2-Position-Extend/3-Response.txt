The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the `math.acos` function is being called with a value outside the valid range `[-1, 1]`. This happens when the target position is not reachable or when the calculation of `cos_theta2` results in a value outside this range.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the value passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range. Additionally, we need to correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator, including the lengths of the links and the TCP offset.

### Revised Solution:

1. **Correct the Calculation of `cos_theta2`:**
   - The Z-coordinate of the target position must be adjusted by the TCP offset before calculating `cos_theta2`.
   - Ensure that the value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to avoid domain errors.

2. **Solve for `theta3`:**
   - The third link's rotation affects the Z-coordinate of the TCP. We can calculate `theta3` based on the adjusted Z-coordinate.

### Updated Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    
    # Adjust the Z-coordinate for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z_d - 0.39225
    
    # Solve for theta2
    cos_theta2 = z_adjusted / 0.425
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    # The third link's rotation affects the Z-coordinate of the TCP
    # Since the third link rotates around the Y-axis, it affects the X and Z coordinates
    # However, in this case, the third link's rotation only affects the Z-coordinate
    # Therefore, theta3 can be calculated based on the Z-coordinate of the target position
    theta3 = math.asin(z_adjusted / 0.425)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
- **`cos_theta2` Clamping:** The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to ensure it is within the valid domain for `math.acos`.
- **`theta3` Calculation:** The third joint angle `theta3` is calculated based on the adjusted Z-coordinate, ensuring the TCP reaches the desired position.

This solution should now handle valid inputs without encountering domain errors.
