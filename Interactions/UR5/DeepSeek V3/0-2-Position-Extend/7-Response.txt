The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics solver is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the target positions. The errors suggest that the solution is not accounting for the full geometry of the manipulator, particularly the third link's influence on the TCP position.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `theta3`:**
   - The current approach assumes that `theta3` can be calculated directly from the adjusted Z-coordinate, but this is not sufficient because the third link's rotation affects both the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `theta1` and `theta2`:**
   - The existing solution for `theta1` and `theta2` does not account for the third link's influence on the TCP position.

3. **Multiple Solutions:**
   - The inverse kinematics problem often has multiple solutions, and the current implementation does not consider this.

### Revised Approach:
To correctly solve the inverse kinematics for this 3-DOF manipulator, we need to:
1. **Account for the Third Link's Influence:**
   - The third link's rotation affects both the X and Z coordinates of the TCP. We need to solve for `theta3` in a way that considers this.

2. **Use a Geometric Approach:**
   - We can use a geometric approach to solve for the joint angles, considering the lengths of the links and the TCP offset.

3. **Handle Multiple Solutions:**
   - The inverse kinematics problem may have multiple valid solutions. We need to ensure that the solution we choose is valid and reaches the target position.

### Updated Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    
    # Adjust the Z-coordinate for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z_d - 0.39225
    
    # Solve for theta2
    # The distance from the origin to the target in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_d**2 + y_d**2)
    # The distance from the second joint to the target in the X-Z plane
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_adjusted**2)
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > 0.425 + 0.1197 or d < abs(0.425 - 0.1197):
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    
    # Calculate cos_theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (0.425**2 + d**2 - 0.1197**2) / (2 * 0.425 * d)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y_d, x_d)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    # The angle between the second link and the line from the second joint to the target
    alpha = math.atan2(z_adjusted, r)
    # The angle between the second link and the third link
    beta = math.acos((0.425**2 + 0.1197**2 - d**2) / (2 * 0.425 * 0.1197))
    # Clamp beta to the valid range [-1, 1]
    beta = max(-1.0, min(1.0, beta))
    theta3 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
- **`theta2` Calculation:** We use the law of cosines to calculate `theta2`, considering the lengths of the second and third links.
- **`theta1` Calculation:** We calculate `theta1` using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the X-Y plane.
- **`theta3` Calculation:** We calculate `theta3` by considering the angles between the second link, the third link, and the line from the second joint to the target.

This solution should now correctly calculate the joint angles to reach the target positions, considering the full geometry of the manipulator.
