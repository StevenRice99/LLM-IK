The error `ValueError: Target position is not reachable` occurs because the code is incorrectly checking the reachability of the target position. The condition `if d > 0.425 + 0.1197 or d < abs(0.425 - 0.1197)` is not appropriate for this manipulator's geometry. Additionally, the feedback indicates that the target positions are valid and reachable, so the reachability check should be removed.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Remove Reachability Check:**
   - Since the feedback confirms that all target positions are reachable, we can remove the reachability check.

2. **Correct Calculation of `theta2` and `theta3`:**
   - The previous implementation of `theta2` and `theta3` was incorrect. We need to use a more accurate geometric approach to calculate these angles.

3. **Use the Law of Cosines:**
   - We will use the law of cosines to calculate `theta2` and `theta3` based on the geometry of the manipulator.

### Updated Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    
    # Adjust the Z-coordinate for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z_d - 0.39225
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y_d, x_d)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    # The distance from the origin to the target in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_d**2 + y_d**2)
    # The distance from the second joint to the target in the X-Z plane
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_adjusted**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (0.425**2 + d**2 - 0.1197**2) / (2 * 0.425 * d)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (0.425**2 + 0.1197**2 - d**2) / (2 * 0.425 * 0.1197)
    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
- **`theta1` Calculation:** We calculate `theta1` using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the X-Y plane.
- **`theta2` Calculation:** We use the law of cosines to calculate `theta2`, considering the lengths of the second and third links.
- **`theta3` Calculation:** We use the law of cosines to calculate `theta3`, considering the lengths of the second and third links.

This solution should now correctly calculate the joint angles to reach the target positions, considering the full geometry of the manipulator. The reachability check has been removed, as the feedback confirms that all target positions are reachable.
