To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1, joint2, joint3) that will position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details of the manipulator, we can break down the problem step by step:

1. **Revolute Joint 1 (Joint1)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis. Its position is at the origin [0, 0, 0]. The rotation of Joint1 will affect the x and y coordinates of the TCP.

2. **Revolute Joint 2 (Joint2)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. Its position is at [0, 0.13585, 0]. The rotation of Joint2 will affect the z coordinate and the projection of the TCP on the x-y plane.

3. **Revolute Joint 3 (Joint3)**: This joint also rotates around the Y-axis. Its position is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]. The rotation of Joint3 will further affect the z coordinate and the projection of the TCP on the x-y plane.

4. **TCP**: The Tool Center Point is located at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the last link.

To find the joint angles, we can use geometric and trigonometric relationships. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Joint1**: The angle for Joint1 can be found using the arctangent of the y and x coordinates of the target position.
   \[
   \text{joint1} = \arctan2(y, x)
   \]

2. **Calculate Joint2 and Joint3**: After determining Joint1, we can project the target position onto the plane defined by Joint2 and Joint3. This simplifies the problem to a 2D planar manipulator, where we can use the law of cosines to find the angles.

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Project the target position onto the plane defined by joint2 and joint3
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    s = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the position of joint2
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from joint2 to joint3
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from joint3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate joint3 using the law of cosines
    D = (r**2 + s**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    joint3 = np.arctan2(np.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    joint2 = np.arctan2(s, r) - np.arctan2(l2 * np.sin(joint3), l1 + l2 * np.cos(joint3))
    
    return joint1, joint2, joint3
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p \). The calculations are based on geometric and trigonometric relationships, and the function returns the joint angles in radians.
