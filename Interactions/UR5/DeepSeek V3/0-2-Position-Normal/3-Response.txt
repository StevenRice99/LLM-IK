To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that will position the TCP at the desired position p = (x, y, z). 

Given the forward kinematics results, we can see how the joint angles affect the position of the TCP. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine θ1
The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ1. We can determine θ1 by using the arctangent function:

\[
\theta1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Determine θ2 and θ3
The second and third joints (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3) rotate around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the XZ plane is influenced by θ2 and θ3. We can use the law of cosines to determine these angles.

First, let's define the lengths of the links:
- L1 = 0.13585 (distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2)
- L2 = 0.425 (distance from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3)
- L3 = 0.39225 (distance from Revolute 3 to TCP)

The position of the TCP relative to Revolute 1 can be represented as:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
\[
z' = z - L1
\]

We can then use the law of cosines to find θ3:
\[
\cos(\theta3) = \frac{r^2 + z'^2 - L2^2 - L3^2}{2 \cdot L2 \cdot L3}
\]
\[
\theta3 = \arccos(\cos(\theta3))
\]

Next, we can find θ2 using the arctangent function:
\[
\theta2 = \arctan2(z', r) - \arctan2(L3 \cdot \sin(\theta3), L2 + L3 \cdot \cos(\theta3))
\]

### Step 3: Implement the Solution in Python
Now, let's implement the solution in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Determine θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Determine θ2 and θ3
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - L1
    
    # Calculate θ3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 + z_prime**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate θ2 using the arctangent function
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_prime, r) - math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 required to position the TCP at the desired position p = (x, y, z). The function uses the arctangent function and the law of cosines to determine the angles, ensuring that the solution is analytical and does not rely on optimization methods.
