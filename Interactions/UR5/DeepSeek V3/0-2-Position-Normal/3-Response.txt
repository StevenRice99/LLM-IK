To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that will position the TCP at the desired position p = (x, y, z).

Given the forward kinematics result, we can see the position of the TCP when all joint angles are set to 0. The TCP position is [0, 0.016149999999999998, 0.81725].

Let's denote the desired TCP position as p = (x, y, z). We need to find the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 such that the TCP reaches this position.

### Step 1: Solve for θ1
The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ1. We can calculate θ1 using the arctangent function:

\[
θ1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for θ2 and θ3
After determining θ1, we can project the desired TCP position onto the plane defined by the second and third joints. Let's denote the projected position as (x', y', z').

The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Y-axis, and the third joint (Revolute 3) also rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the law of cosines to solve for θ2 and θ3.

Let's denote the lengths of the links as:
- L1 = 0.13585 (distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2)
- L2 = 0.425 (distance from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3)
- L3 = 0.39225 (distance from Revolute 3 to TCP)

The projected position (x', y', z') can be calculated as:
\[
x' = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
\[
z' = z - L1
\]

Now, we can use the law of cosines to solve for θ2 and θ3:
\[
d = \sqrt{x'^2 + z'^2}
\]
\[
θ3 = \arccos\left(\frac{L2^2 + L3^2 - d^2}{2 \cdot L2 \cdot L3}\right)
\]
\[
θ2 = \arctan2(z', x') - \arctan2(L3 \cdot \sin(θ3), L2 + L3 \cdot \cos(θ3))
\]

### Step 3: Implement the Solution in Python
Now, let's implement the solution in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 and θ3
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - L1
    
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    theta3 = math.acos((L2**2 + L3**2 - d**2) / (2 * L2 * L3))
    
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles θ1, θ2, and θ3 required to position the TCP at the desired position p = (x, y, z). The function uses the arctangent function and the law of cosines to solve for the joint angles.
