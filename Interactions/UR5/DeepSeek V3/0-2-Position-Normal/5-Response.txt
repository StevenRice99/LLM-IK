The error indicates that the argument to `math.acos` is outside the valid range [-1, 1], which can happen if the target position is not reachable. However, according to the instructions, we can assume that all target positions given as inputs are reachable. Therefore, the issue might be due to a miscalculation in the code.

Let's re-examine the calculation of `d` and ensure that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range.

### Step 1: Re-examining the Calculation of `d`
The value of `d` is calculated as:
\[
d = \sqrt{x'^2 + z'^2}
\]
where:
\[
x' = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
\[
z' = z - L1
\]

### Step 2: Ensuring the Argument to `math.acos` is Valid
The argument to `math.acos` is:
\[
\frac{L2^2 + L3^2 - d^2}{2 \cdot L2 \cdot L3}
\]
We need to ensure that this value is within the range [-1, 1].

### Step 3: Adjusting the Calculation
Let's adjust the calculation to ensure that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range. We can use the `min` and `max` functions to clamp the value.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 and θ3
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - L1
    
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Ensure the argument to math.acos is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    arg = (L2**2 + L3**2 - d**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    arg = max(-1.0, min(1.0, arg))  # Clamp the value to the valid range
    
    theta3 = math.acos(arg)
    
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This adjusted code ensures that the argument to `math.acos` is clamped to the valid range [-1, 1], preventing the `ValueError: math domain error`.
