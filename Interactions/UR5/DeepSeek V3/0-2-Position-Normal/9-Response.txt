Given the feedback, it's clear that the current inverse kinematics solution is not correctly computing the joint angles for some target positions. The main issue seems to be in the calculation of `theta2` and `theta3`. Let's re-examine the approach and adjust it accordingly.

### Revised Approach

1. **Solve for θ1**:
   - θ1 = atan2(y, x)

2. **Project the desired position onto the plane defined by θ1**:
   - r = sqrt(x² + y²)
   - z_prime = z - 0.39225

3. **Solve for θ2 and θ3**:
   - L1 = 0.13585
   - L2 = sqrt((-0.1197)² + 0.425²)
   - D = (r² + z_prime² - L1² - L2²) / (2 * L1 * L2)
   - D = max(-1.0, min(D, 1.0))  # Clamp D to the range [-1, 1]
   - theta3 = atan2(sqrt(1 - D²), D)
   - theta2 = atan2(z_prime, r) - atan2(L2 * sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * cos(theta3))

### Updated Code

```python
import numpy as np
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Project the desired position onto the plane defined by θ1
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - 0.39225  # Adjust for TCP offset
    
    # Solve for θ2 and θ3 using the projected coordinates
    # Using the law of cosines
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = math.sqrt((-0.1197)**2 + 0.425**2)
    
    D = (r**2 + z_prime**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Clamp D to the range [-1, 1] to avoid numerical inaccuracies
    D = max(-1.0, min(D, 1.0))
    
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_prime, r) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ1 Calculation**: We use `atan2(y, x)` to find the angle that aligns the end-effector with the desired x and y coordinates.
2. **Projection**: We project the desired position onto the plane defined by θ1 to simplify the problem to a 2D plane.
3. **θ2 and θ3 Calculation**: We use the law of cosines to solve for θ3 and then use the projected coordinates to solve for θ2.

This revised solution should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target positions. If the issue persists, further debugging and validation of the geometric relationships and calculations will be necessary.
