The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the desired target positions and orientations. The issue lies in the way the joint angles are being calculated, particularly for θ₂ and θ₃, which are both rotating around the Y-axis. The current approach of using `atan2(x, z)` for both θ₂ and θ₃ is incorrect because it does not account for the kinematic chain and the cumulative effect of the joint rotations.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (θ₁):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ₁ is calculated using `atan2(-x, y)` to align the manipulator with the target position in the XY plane. This part of the solution is correct.

2. **Joint 2 (θ₂):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ₂ should be calculated based on the position of the target relative to the second joint, taking into account the rotation of the first joint.

3. **Joint 3 (θ₃):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ₃ should be calculated based on the position of the target relative to the third joint, taking into account the rotations of the first and second joints.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ₁ (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Transform the target position to the frame of Joint 2
    x2 = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y2 = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z2 = z
    
    # Solve for θ₂ (Joint 2)
    # The target position relative to Joint 2 is [x2, y2 - 0.13585, z2]
    theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2)
    
    # Solve for θ₃ (Joint 3)
    # The target position relative to Joint 3 is [x2, y2 - 0.13585 + 0.1197, z2 - 0.425]
    theta3 = math.atan2(x2, z2 - 0.425)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation:
- **θ₁ (Joint 1):** The angle is calculated using `atan2(-x, y)` to align the manipulator with the target position in the XY plane.
- **θ₂ (Joint 2):** The target position is transformed to the frame of Joint 2 by accounting for the rotation of Joint 1. The angle θ₂ is then calculated using `atan2(x2, z2)`.
- **θ₃ (Joint 3):** The target position is further transformed to the frame of Joint 3 by accounting for the rotation of Joint 1 and the position of Joint 2. The angle θ₃ is then calculated using `atan2(x2, z2 - 0.425)`.

This revised approach should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF serial manipulator. However, further refinement may be necessary to account for the specific geometry and constraints of the manipulator.
