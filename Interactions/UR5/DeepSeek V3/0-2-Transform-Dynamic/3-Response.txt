The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions and orientations. The provided correct joint values suggest that the solution requires a more comprehensive approach, considering the geometry of the manipulator and the relationships between the joints.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (θ₁):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ₁.
   - We can use the `atan2` function to determine the angle based on the target position's X and Y coordinates.

2. **Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃):**
   - The second and third joints rotate around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the XZ plane is influenced by θ₂ and θ₃.
   - We need to consider the link lengths and the geometry of the manipulator to solve for θ₂ and θ₃.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    # Solve for θ₁ (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ (Joint 2) and θ₃ (Joint 3)
    # Calculate the position of the end of the second link
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - L1
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the TCP
    D = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Law of cosines to find θ₃
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)
    
    # Law of cosines to find θ₂
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * sin_theta3, L2 + L3 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
- **θ₁ (Joint 1):** The angle is calculated using `atan2(y, x)` to determine the rotation around the Z-axis that aligns the manipulator with the target position in the XY plane.
- **θ₂ (Joint 2) and θ₃ (Joint 3):** The angles are calculated using the law of cosines and the geometry of the manipulator. The position of the end of the second link is calculated, and the distances and angles are used to determine θ₂ and θ₃.

### Next Steps:
To verify the solution, you can call the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position and orientation to see if the calculated joint angles correctly position the TCP.

TEST_SOLUTION x y z rx ry rz

This revised approach should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF serial manipulator.
