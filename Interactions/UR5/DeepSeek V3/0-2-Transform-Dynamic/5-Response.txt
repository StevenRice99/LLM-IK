The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the argument to `math.sqrt` is negative, which is not allowed. This happens when the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the range `[-1, 1]`, which can occur if the target position is unreachable or if there is a miscalculation in the geometry.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the value of `cos_theta3` is within the valid range before calculating `sin_theta3`. Additionally, we should handle cases where the target position is unreachable gracefully, even though the problem states that all targets are reachable.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    # Solve for θ₁ (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ (Joint 2) and θ₃ (Joint 3)
    # Calculate the position of the end of the second link
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - L1
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the TCP
    D = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if D > L2 + L3 or D < abs(L2 - L3):
        raise ValueError("Target position is unreachable")
    
    # Law of cosines to find θ₃
    cos_theta3 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within the valid range
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)
    
    # Law of cosines to find θ₂
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta = math.atan2(L3 * sin_theta3, L2 + L3 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Range Check for `cos_theta3`:**
   - The value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` using `max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)` to ensure it is valid for the `math.sqrt` function.

2. **Reachability Check:**
   - A check is added to ensure that the target position is reachable by verifying that the distance `D` is within the range `[abs(L2 - L3), L2 + L3]`. If not, a `ValueError` is raised.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code now gracefully handles edge cases where the target position might be on the boundary of the workspace.

### Next Steps:
To verify the solution, you can call the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position and orientation to see if the calculated joint angles correctly position the TCP.

```plaintext
TEST_SOLUTION x y z rx ry rz
```

This revised implementation should avoid the `math domain error` and provide a more robust solution for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF serial manipulator.
