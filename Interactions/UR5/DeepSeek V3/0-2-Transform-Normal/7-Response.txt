The error occurs because the `^` operator in Python is the **bitwise XOR operator**, not the exponentiation operator. For exponentiation, you should use `**`. This is a simple syntax issue that can be fixed by replacing `^` with `**`.

### Corrected Code
Here is the corrected implementation of the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    phi, theta, psi = r
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Project the position onto the plane defined by the second and third joints
    x_prime = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - 0.13585
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the TCP
    d = np.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using a geometric approach
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta = np.arccos(np.clip((L2**2 + d**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * d), -1, 1))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip((L2**2 + L3**2 - d**2) / (2 * L2 * L3), -1, 1))
    
    # Handle multiple configurations
    theta2_alt = alpha + beta
    theta3_alt = -theta3
    
    # Choose the configuration that best matches the desired orientation
    # (This step requires additional logic based on the desired orientation)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Fix
1. **Exponentiation Operator**: Replaced `^` with `**` for exponentiation in the calculation of `theta3`.
2. **Numerical Stability**: Used `np.clip` to ensure that the argument to `np.arccos` remains within the valid range \([-1, 1]\).

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**: Use `np.arctan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle of the first joint.
2. **Project the TCP Position**: Project the TCP position onto the plane defined by the second and third joints.
3. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)**: Use a geometric approach to calculate the angles of the second and third joints.
4. **Handle Multiple Configurations**: Consider both elbow-up and elbow-down configurations.
5. **Return Joint Angles**: Return the calculated joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \).

### Final Notes
This corrected implementation should now work without syntax errors. However, additional logic may be needed to choose the best joint configuration based on the desired orientation.
