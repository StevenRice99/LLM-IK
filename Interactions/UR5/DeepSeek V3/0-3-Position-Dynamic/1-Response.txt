To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we can break the problem into two parts:

1. **Solve for the first joint (Revolute 1)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis, and its angle can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the XY plane.
2. **Solve for the remaining joints (Revolute 2, Revolute 3, Revolute 4)**: These joints rotate around the Y-axis, and their angles can be determined by the position of the target relative to the first joint.

We can use the existing functions to help us solve these sub-problems. Let's start by solving for the first joint using the existing code from "EXISTING 1".

### Step 1: Solve for the first joint (Revolute 1)
The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, and its angle can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the XY plane. The existing code from "EXISTING 1" provides a solution for this:

```python
import math

def solve_joint1(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint value needed to reach position "p" for the first joint.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the first joint to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    return theta1
```

### Step 2: Solve for the remaining joints (Revolute 2, Revolute 3, Revolute 4)
The remaining joints rotate around the Y-axis, and their angles can be determined by the position of the target relative to the first joint. The existing code from "EXISTING 2" provides a solution for this:

```python
import math

def solve_joints234(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" for the remaining joints.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    theta3 = 0
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Step 3: Combine the solutions
Now, we can combine these two solutions to solve for all four joints. The first joint is solved using `solve_joint1`, and the remaining joints are solved using `solve_joints234`.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for the first joint (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Transform the target position to the coordinate system of the second joint
    # The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, so we need to rotate the target position
    # by -theta1 around the Z-axis to get the position in the second joint's frame.
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_rot = x * cos_theta1 + y * sin_theta1
    y_rot = -x * sin_theta1 + y * cos_theta1
    z_rot = z
    
    # Solve for the remaining joints (Revolute 2, Revolute 3, Revolute 4)
    theta2, theta3, theta4 = solve_joints234((x_rot, y_rot, z_rot))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation:
1. **First Joint (Revolute 1)**: We calculate `theta1` using the `atan2` function, which gives us the angle required to align the target position with the Y-axis in the XY plane.
2. **Transformation**: We then transform the target position to the coordinate system of the second joint by rotating it by `-theta1` around the Z-axis.
3. **Remaining Joints (Revolute 2, Revolute 3, Revolute 4)**: We use the existing `solve_joints234` function to calculate the angles for the remaining joints based on the transformed target position.

This approach ensures that we correctly solve for all four joints to reach the target position.
