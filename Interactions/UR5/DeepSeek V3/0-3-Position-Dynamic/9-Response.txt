The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics solver is still not producing the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint angles suggest that the approach needs to be significantly revised. Let’s analyze the problem and develop a more robust solution.

---

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Transformation**: The transformation of the target position into the coordinate system of the second joint may not be accurate.
2. **Incorrect Joint Calculations**: The calculations for `theta2`, `theta3`, and `theta4` may not account for the correct geometric relationships.
3. **TCP Offset Handling**: The TCP offset may not be correctly applied in the calculations.

---

### Revised Approach:
To address these issues, we will:
1. **Correctly Transform the Target Position**: Use the correct transformation to account for the first joint's rotation.
2. **Use Geometric Relationships**: Apply the correct geometric relationships for the remaining joints.
3. **Handle the TCP Offset**: Ensure the TCP offset is correctly applied in the calculations.

Here’s the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for the first joint (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Transform the target position to the coordinate system of the second joint
    # The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, so we need to rotate the target position
    # by -theta1 around the Z-axis to get the position in the second joint's frame.
    cos_theta1 = math.cos(theta1)
    sin_theta1 = math.sin(theta1)
    x_rot = x * cos_theta1 + y * sin_theta1
    y_rot = -x * sin_theta1 + y * cos_theta1
    z_rot = z
    
    # Solve for the remaining joints (Revolute 2, Revolute 3, Revolute 4)
    # Adjust for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    y_rot_adj = y_rot - tcp_offset
    
    # Solve for theta2, theta3, and theta4
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_rot ** 2 + z_rot ** 2)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta2 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_rot * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_rot * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x_rot, z_rot)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta
    theta4 = 0  # Assuming no rotation for the TCP
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **First Joint Calculation**: The first joint angle `theta1` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)` to align the target position with the X-axis in the XY plane.
2. **Transformation**: The target position is transformed into the coordinate system of the second joint by rotating it by `-theta1` around the Z-axis.
3. **TCP Offset Adjustment**: The `y_rot` value is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset (`0.093`) to account for the TCP's position relative to the last joint.
4. **Joint Calculations**: The remaining joint angles `theta2`, `theta3`, and `theta4` are calculated using the geometric relationships for the manipulator.

### Testing the Function:
You can test the function with various target positions to ensure it works correctly. For example:

```python
target_position = (0.5, 0.3, 0.4)
joint_angles = inverse_kinematics(target_position)
print(joint_angles)
```

---

### Next Steps:
If the function still fails to reach some targets, we may need to:
1. **Verify the Geometric Model**: Ensure the link lengths and TCP offset are correctly applied.
2. **Handle Edge Cases**: Add logic to handle edge cases, such as when the target position is aligned with the Z-axis or when the manipulator is fully extended.
3. **Use Numerical Methods**: If a closed-form solution is not sufficient, consider using numerical methods to refine the joint angles.
