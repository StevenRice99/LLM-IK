The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the target positions. The main issue lies in the geometric approach used to solve for \( \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \). Specifically, the law of cosines and sines approach does not account for the full 3D nature of the problem, leading to incorrect joint angles.

To address this, we need to refine the solution by considering the full 3D geometry of the manipulator. Hereâ€™s an updated approach:

### Step 1: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, so \( \theta_1 \) can still be found using the arctangent of the x and y coordinates of the target position:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Project the Target Position
After determining \( \theta_1 \), we project the target position onto the plane perpendicular to the Z-axis. This gives us the radial distance \( r \) and the height \( z \):
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
\[
z_{\text{target}} = z
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \)
We now need to solve for \( \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) such that the end-effector reaches the projected target position. This can be done using a geometric approach, but we need to consider the full 3D geometry.

#### Step 3.1: Define the Link Lengths
The lengths of the links are:
\[
L1 = 0.13585
\]
\[
L2 = 0.425
\]
\[
L3 = 0.39225
\]
\[
L4 = 0.093
\]

#### Step 3.2: Solve for \( \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \)
We can use the following approach to solve for \( \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \):

1. **Calculate the position of the wrist center**:
   The wrist center is located at a distance \( L4 \) from the TCP. Therefore, the wrist center position \( (x_w, y_w, z_w) \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   x_w = r - L4 \cdot \cos(\theta_1)
   \]
   \[
   y_w = z_{\text{target}} - L4 \cdot \sin(\theta_1)
   \]

2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)**:
   We can use the law of cosines to solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \). The distance from the second joint to the wrist center is:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{x_w^2 + y_w^2}
   \]
   The angles \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) can be found using:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan2(y_w, x_w) - \arctan2(L3 \cdot \sin(\theta_3), L2 + L3 \cdot \cos(\theta_3))
   \]
   \[
   \theta_3 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 - L2^2 - L3^2}{2 \cdot L2 \cdot L3}\right)
   \]

3. **Solve for \( \theta_4 \)**:
   The angle \( \theta_4 \) can be found using:
   \[
   \theta_4 = -(\theta_2 + \theta_3)
   \]

### Step 4: Implementation
We will implement the refined solution in Python using the `numpy` library for mathematical operations.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Project the target position onto the plane perpendicular to the Z-axis
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_target = z
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta2, theta3, theta4 using geometric approach
    # Define the lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    L4 = 0.093
    
    # The wrist center position
    x_w = r - L4 * np.cos(theta1)
    y_w = z_target - L4 * np.sin(theta1)
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the wrist center
    d = np.sqrt(x_w**2 + y_w**2)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta3, -1, 1))
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_w, x_w)
    beta = np.arctan2(L3 * np.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = - (theta2 + theta3)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: We calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the arctangent of the x and y coordinates.
- **Step 2**: We project the target position onto the plane perpendicular to the Z-axis.
- **Step 3**: We use the geometric approach to solve for \( \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) using the law of cosines and the law of sines.

This refined solution should better handle the 3D geometry of the manipulator and produce more accurate joint angles.
