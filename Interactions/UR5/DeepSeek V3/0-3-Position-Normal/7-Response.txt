The error occurs because the `^` operator in Python is the **bitwise XOR operator**, not the exponentiation operator. To fix this, we need to use the `**` operator for exponentiation. Here's the corrected code:

### Corrected Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Project the target position onto the plane perpendicular to the Z-axis
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_target = z
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta2, theta3, theta4 using geometric approach
    # Define the lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    L4 = 0.093
    
    # The wrist center position
    x_w = r - L4 * np.cos(theta1)
    y_w = z_target - L4 * np.sin(theta1)
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the wrist center
    d = np.sqrt(x_w**2 + y_w**2)
    
    # Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta3, -1, 1))
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_w, x_w)
    beta = np.arctan2(L3 * np.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = - (theta2 + theta3)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Exponentiation Operator**:
   - Replaced `^` with `**` for exponentiation in the calculation of `cos_theta3`:
     ```python
     cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
     ```

2. **No Other Changes**:
   - The rest of the code remains unchanged, as it was logically correct.

### Testing the Solution
This corrected code should now run without errors. However, based on the previous feedback, the solution may still not reach all targets due to limitations in the geometric approach. If further refinement is needed, we can explore alternative methods, such as using symbolic computation or iterative approaches.
