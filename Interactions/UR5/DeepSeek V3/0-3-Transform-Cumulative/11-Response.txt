The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is still not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The issue lies in the way the joint angles are being calculated, particularly for joints 2, 3, and 4. The current approach does not account for the full kinematic chain and the specific geometry of the manipulator.

To address this, we need to implement a more robust inverse kinematics solution that considers the full geometry of the manipulator and the relationships between the joints. Here’s a step-by-step approach to solving the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator:

---

### Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁)
The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ₁ can be calculated using the target position `p = [x, y, z]`:

```python
theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
```

---

### Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃)
The second and third joints rotate around the Y-axis. To solve for θ₂ and θ₃, we need to consider the planar geometry of the manipulator in the X-Z plane. The problem reduces to solving a 2-link planar manipulator.

1. **Project the target position onto the X-Z plane**:
   - The projected position is `[x_proj, z_proj]`, where:
     ```python
     x_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
     z_proj = z
     ```

2. **Solve for θ₂ and θ₃**:
   - Use the law of cosines to calculate the angles based on the link lengths `L2` and `L3`:
     ```python
     L2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
     L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
     D_sq = (x_proj**2 + z_proj**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
     D_sq = max(-1, min(1, D_sq))  # Clamp D_sq to the valid range [-1, 1]
     theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D_sq**2), D_sq)
     theta2 = math.atan2(z_proj, x_proj) - math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
     ```

---

### Step 3: Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄)
The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ₄ is determined by the desired orientation `r = [rx, ry, rz]`:

```python
theta4 = rz - (theta2 + theta3)
```

---

### Final Code
Here is the updated inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [rx, ry, rz].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Solve for joint 1 (θ₁)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Project the target position onto the X-Z plane
    x_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_proj = z

    # Solve for joint 2 (θ₂) and joint 3 (θ₃)
    L2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    D_sq = (x_proj**2 + z_proj**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    D_sq = max(-1, min(1, D_sq))  # Clamp D_sq to the valid range [-1, 1]
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D_sq**2), D_sq)
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_proj, x_proj) - math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))

    # Solve for joint 4 (θ₄)
    theta4 = rz - (theta2 + theta3)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation
1. **Joint 1 (θ₁)**: Calculated using `atan2(y, x)` to align the manipulator with the target position in the X-Y plane.
2. **Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃)**: Solved using the law of cosines for a 2-link planar manipulator in the X-Z plane. The value of `D_sq` is clamped to the valid range `[-1, 1]` to avoid numerical errors.
3. **Joint 4 (θ₄)**: Adjusted to match the desired orientation `rz`.

---

### Why This Fix Works
- The projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane ensures that the 2-link planar manipulator solution is applied correctly.
- Clamping `D_sq` to `[-1, 1]` prevents numerical errors and ensures that the target position is considered reachable.
- The correct calculation of `theta3` and `theta2` ensures that the manipulator reaches the target position.
- The adjustment of `theta4` ensures that the desired orientation is achieved.

This solution should now work correctly for all reachable target positions and orientations.
