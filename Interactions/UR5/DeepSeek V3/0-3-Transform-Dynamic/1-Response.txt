To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. We will use the existing solutions for each joint as a starting point and extend them to solve for the entire chain.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution to find the angle `theta1` that aligns the manipulator in the direction of the target position.
   - The existing solution for Joint 1 is:
     ```python
     theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
     ```

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to find the angle `theta2` that positions the end effector in the correct plane.
   - The existing solution for Joint 2 is:
     ```python
     theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
     ```

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We need to find the angle `theta3` that positions the end effector at the correct height.
   - The existing solution for Joint 3 is:
     ```python
     theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
     ```

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to find the angle `theta4` that aligns the TCP with the desired orientation.
   - The existing solution for Joint 4 is:
     ```python
     theta4 = math.atan2(px, pz)
     ```

### Implementation:

We will now implement the inverse kinematics function by combining the existing solutions for each joint:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1: Rotates around Z-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 4: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle `theta1` is calculated using `atan2(-x, y)` to align the manipulator in the direction of the target position.
- **Joint 2:** The angle `theta2` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to position the end effector in the correct plane.
- **Joint 3:** The angle `theta3` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to position the end effector at the correct height.
- **Joint 4:** The angle `theta4` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to align the TCP with the desired orientation.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable targets.
