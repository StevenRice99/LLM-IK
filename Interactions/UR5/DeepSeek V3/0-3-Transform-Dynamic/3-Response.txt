The feedback indicates that the initial implementation of the inverse kinematics function did not correctly solve for the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The main issue is that the existing solutions for each joint were applied independently without considering the interdependence of the joints in the kinematic chain. To address this, we need to develop a more comprehensive solution that accounts for the geometry of the manipulator and the relationships between the joints.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution to find the angle `theta1` that aligns the manipulator in the direction of the target position.
   - The existing solution for Joint 1 is:
     ```python
     theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
     ```

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to find the angle `theta2` that positions the end effector in the correct plane.
   - The existing solution for Joint 2 is:
     ```python
     theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
     ```

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We need to find the angle `theta3` that positions the end effector at the correct height.
   - The existing solution for Joint 3 is:
     ```python
     theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
     ```

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to find the angle `theta4` that aligns the TCP with the desired orientation.
   - The existing solution for Joint 4 is:
     ```python
     theta4 = math.atan2(px, pz)
     ```

### Implementation:

We will now implement the inverse kinematics function by combining the existing solutions for each joint and considering the geometry of the manipulator:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1: Rotates around Z-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 4: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle `theta1` is calculated using `atan2(-x, y)` to align the manipulator in the direction of the target position.
- **Joint 2:** The angle `theta2` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to position the end effector in the correct plane.
- **Joint 3:** The angle `theta3` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to position the end effector at the correct height.
- **Joint 4:** The angle `theta4` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to align the TCP with the desired orientation.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable targets. However, the feedback indicates that this approach is not sufficient. To improve the solution, we need to consider the geometry of the manipulator and the relationships between the joints more carefully.

### Next Steps:
To further refine the solution, we need to:
1. **Calculate the position of the end effector relative to the base frame.**
2. **Use the geometry of the manipulator to determine the joint angles.**
3. **Ensure that the joint angles are within their limits.**

Given the complexity of the problem, it may be necessary to use a more advanced method, such as the geometric approach or the algebraic approach, to solve the inverse kinematics problem accurately. This would involve deriving the equations that describe the position and orientation of the end effector in terms of the joint angles and solving these equations to find the joint angles that achieve the desired position and orientation.

Given the feedback, it is clear that the initial approach is not sufficient, and a more comprehensive solution is required. I will now call the `FORWARD_KINEMATICS` function to test the current solution and gather more information to refine the approach.
