The error occurs because `nsolve` requires at least as many equations as variables. In this case, we have 3 equations (from the position components) but 4 variables (the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`, and `theta4`). This means the system is underdetermined, and `nsolve` cannot solve it directly.

To resolve this, we need to add additional constraints or use a different approach. Since the manipulator has 4 degrees of freedom and we are solving for both position and orientation, we need to include the orientation constraints in the system of equations. However, as previously mentioned, directly solving for the orientation is complex due to the orthonormality constraints of the rotation matrix.

### Revised Approach
Instead of using `nsolve`, we will use a geometric approach to solve the inverse kinematics problem. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step plan:

1. **Solve for `theta1`**: Use the x and y components of the target position to determine `theta1`.
2. **Solve for `theta2` and `theta3`**: Use the z component and the distance in the x-y plane to determine `theta2` and `theta3`.
3. **Solve for `theta4`**: Use the orientation constraints to determine `theta4`.

### Implementation
```python
import numpy as np
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    d2 = 0.13585
    d3 = -0.1197
    a3 = 0.425
    d4 = 0.39225
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3
    # Project the target position onto the x-y plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    # Adjust for the offset of link 2
    r -= d2
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the z and r components
    D = (r**2 + z**2 - a3**2 - d4**2) / (2 * a3 * d4)
    if D > 1 or D < -1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is unreachable")
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(z, r) - math.atan2(d4 * math.sin(theta3), a3 + d4 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta4
    # The orientation is determined by the difference between the target orientation and the orientation of the first three joints
    # For simplicity, assume theta4 is the difference between the target orientation and the orientation of the first three joints
    theta4 = r[2] - (theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Geometric Approach**: Instead of using `nsolve`, we use a geometric approach to solve for the joint angles.
2. **Step 1: Solve for `theta1`**: We use the `atan2` function to determine `theta1` based on the x and y components of the target position.
3. **Step 2: Solve for `theta2` and `theta3`**: We project the target position onto the x-y plane and use the z component to solve for `theta2` and `theta3` using the law of cosines.
4. **Step 3: Solve for `theta4`**: We assume `theta4` is the difference between the target orientation and the orientation of the first three joints. This is a simplification and may need to be adjusted based on the specific orientation requirements.

### Next Steps:
This implementation should work for most cases, but it assumes a specific orientation for `theta4`. If the orientation requirements are more complex, we may need to refine the solution further. Let me know if you'd like to explore that.
