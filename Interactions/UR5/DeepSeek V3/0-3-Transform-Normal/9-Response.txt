The feedback indicates that the current implementation fails to reach the target positions and orientations in most cases. This is because the geometric approach used in the previous implementation is too simplistic and does not account for the full complexity of the manipulator's kinematics, especially the orientation constraints.

To address this, we need to use a more robust method that considers both the position and orientation of the TCP. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

---

### Revised Approach
1. **Use Transformation Matrices**: Represent the forward kinematics using transformation matrices for each joint.
2. **Solve for Joint Angles**: Use a numerical solver to find the joint angles that minimize the difference between the target and computed TCP position and orientation.

### Implementation
```python
import numpy as np
import math
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    # Target position and orientation
    target_position = np.array(p)
    target_orientation = np.array(r)  # Roll, pitch, yaw in radians

    # Link lengths
    d2 = 0.13585
    d3 = -0.1197
    a3 = 0.425
    d4 = 0.39225

    # Function to compute the forward kinematics
    def forward_kinematics(theta):
        theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4 = theta

        # Transformation matrices
        T01 = np.array([
            [math.cos(theta1), -math.sin(theta1), 0, 0],
            [math.sin(theta1), math.cos(theta1), 0, 0],
            [0, 0, 1, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 1]
        ])

        T12 = np.array([
            [math.cos(theta2), 0, math.sin(theta2), 0],
            [0, 1, 0, d2],
            [-math.sin(theta2), 0, math.cos(theta2), 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 1]
        ])

        T23 = np.array([
            [math.cos(theta3), 0, math.sin(theta3), a3],
            [0, 1, 0, d3],
            [-math.sin(theta3), 0, math.cos(theta3), 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 1]
        ])

        T34 = np.array([
            [math.cos(theta4), 0, math.sin(theta4), 0],
            [0, 1, 0, d4],
            [-math.sin(theta4), 0, math.cos(theta4), 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 1]
        ])

        # Total transformation matrix
        T04 = T01 @ T12 @ T23 @ T34

        # Extract position and orientation
        position = T04[:3, 3]
        orientation = np.array([
            math.atan2(T04[2, 1], T04[2, 2]),
            math.asin(-T04[2, 0]),
            math.atan2(T04[1, 0], T04[0, 0])
        ])

        return position, orientation

    # Objective function to minimize
    def objective(theta):
        position, orientation = forward_kinematics(theta)
        position_error = np.linalg.norm(position - target_position)
        orientation_error = np.linalg.norm(orientation - target_orientation)
        return position_error + orientation_error

    # Initial guess for joint angles
    initial_guess = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    # Solve for joint angles
    result = minimize(objective, initial_guess, method='SLSQP')

    # Return the joint angles
    return tuple(result.x)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Forward Kinematics**: The `forward_kinematics` function computes the TCP position and orientation using transformation matrices for each joint.
2. **Objective Function**: The `objective` function calculates the error between the target and computed TCP position and orientation.
3. **Numerical Optimization**: The `minimize` function from `scipy.optimize` is used to find the joint angles that minimize the error.

---

### Advantages:
- **Robustness**: This approach considers both position and orientation, making it more robust than the previous geometric method.
- **Flexibility**: It can handle a wide range of target positions and orientations.

---

### Next Steps:
This implementation should now work for most cases. If further refinement is needed, we can adjust the objective function or use a different optimization method.
