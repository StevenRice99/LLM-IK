To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). We can break this problem down into several steps, leveraging the existing solutions provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁):**
   - Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution from **Existing 1** to determine θ₁ based on the target position \( p \).

2. **Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃):**
   - Joints 2 and 3 rotate around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **Existing 4** to determine θ₂ and θ₃ based on the target position \( p \).

3. **Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄):**
   - Joint 4 rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **Existing 8** to determine θ₄ based on the target position \( p \).

4. **Solve for Joint 5 (θ₅):**
   - Joint 5 rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution from **Existing 10** to determine θ₅ based on the target position \( p \).

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃)
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta
    
    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄)
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 5 (θ₅)
    theta5 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** We calculate θ₁ using the `atan2` function to determine the angle required to align the manipulator with the target position in the XY plane.
- **Step 2:** We calculate θ₂ and θ₃ using the law of cosines and the `atan2` function to determine the angles required to position the end effector at the desired height and distance.
- **Step 3:** We calculate θ₄ using the `atan2` function to align the end effector with the target position in the XZ plane.
- **Step 4:** We calculate θ₅ using the `atan2` function to align the end effector with the target position in the XY plane.

This solution provides the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
