The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the target positions. The problem lies in the approach used to compute the joint angles, particularly for joints 2, 3, and 4. The initial solution assumes a simplified geometric approach, which does not account for the full kinematic chain of the manipulator.

To address this, we need to use a more systematic approach, such as solving the inverse kinematics using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters or a geometric approach that considers the full manipulator structure. Here, we will use a geometric approach to compute the joint angles.

### Revised Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - This joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The angle \( \theta_1 \) is calculated using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
     \]

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - This joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP in the XZ plane depends on the angle of this joint.
   - We can calculate the angle \( \theta_2 \) using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arctan2(z, \sqrt{x^2 + y^2})
     \]

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - This joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP in the XZ plane depends on the angle of this joint.
   - We can calculate the angle \( \theta_3 \) using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_3 = \arctan2(z - L_2 \sin(\theta_2), \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - L_2 \cos(\theta_2))
     \]
     where \( L_2 \) is the length of the second link.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - This joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP in the XZ plane depends on the angle of this joint.
   - We can calculate the angle \( \theta_4 \) using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_4 = \arctan2(z - L_2 \sin(\theta_2) - L_3 \sin(\theta_3), \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - L_2 \cos(\theta_2) - L_3 \cos(\theta_3))
     \]
     where \( L_3 \) is the length of the third link.

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - This joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The orientation of the TCP depends on the angle of this joint.
   - We can calculate the angle \( \theta_5 \) using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_5 = \arctan2(\text{orientation}_y, \text{orientation}_x)
     \]

### Revised Python Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Joint 2
    L2 = 0.13585
    theta2 = np.arctan2(z, np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2))
    
    # Joint 3
    L3 = 0.425
    theta3 = np.arctan2(z - L2 * np.sin(theta2), np.sqrt(x**2 + y^2) - L2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Joint 4
    L4 = 0.39225
    theta4 = np.arctan2(z - L2 * np.sin(theta2) - L3 * np.sin(theta3), np.sqrt(x**2 + y^2) - L2 * np.cos(theta2) - L3 * np.cos(theta3))
    
    # Joint 5
    theta5 = 0.0  # Assuming no specific orientation requirement
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle \( \theta_1 \) is calculated using the arctangent of the y and x coordinates of the target position.
- **Joint 2:** The angle \( \theta_2 \) is calculated using the arctangent of the z coordinate and the distance in the XY plane.
- **Joint 3:** The angle \( \theta_3 \) is calculated by considering the position of the TCP relative to the second link.
- **Joint 4:** The angle \( \theta_4 \) is calculated by considering the position of the TCP relative to the third link.
- **Joint 5:** The angle \( \theta_5 \) is set to 0.0, assuming no specific orientation requirement.

This revised solution provides the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired target position.
