The error occurs because the variables `theta2`, `theta3`, and `theta4` are used in the calculation of `x_w`, `y_w`, and `z_w` before they are defined. This is a logical error in the code. To fix this, we need to calculate the wrist center position without relying on the undefined joint angles.

### Corrected Approach:
We will calculate the wrist center position based on the TCP position and the length of the fifth link. Then, we will solve for the joint angles using the wrist center position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - This joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The angle \( \theta_1 \) is calculated using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
     \]

2. **Wrist Center Position:**
   - The wrist center is located at a distance \( L_5 \) from the TCP along the Z-axis of the fifth link.
   - The wrist center position \( (x_w, y_w, z_w) \) is calculated as:
     \[
     x_w = x - L_5 \cdot \cos(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     y_w = y - L_5 \cdot \sin(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     z_w = z
     \]

3. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - This joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The angle \( \theta_2 \) is calculated using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arctan2(z_w, \sqrt{x_w^2 + y_w^2})
     \]

4. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - This joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The angle \( \theta_3 \) is calculated using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_3 = \arctan2(z_w - L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_2), \sqrt{x_w^2 + y_w^2} - L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2))
     \]

5. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - This joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The angle \( \theta_4 \) is calculated using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_4 = \arctan2(z_w - L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_2) - L_3 \cdot \sin(\theta_3), \sqrt{x_w^2 + y_w^2} - L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2) - L_3 \cdot \cos(\theta_3))
     \]

6. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - This joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The orientation of the TCP depends on the angle of this joint.
   - We can calculate the angle \( \theta_5 \) using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta_5 = \arctan2(\text{orientation}_y, \text{orientation}_x)
     \]

### Corrected Python Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L2 = 0.13585
    L3 = 0.425
    L4 = 0.39225
    L5 = 0.093
    L6 = 0.09465
    
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Wrist center position
    x_w = x - L6 * np.cos(theta1)
    y_w = y - L6 * np.sin(theta1)
    z_w = z
    
    # Joint 2
    theta2 = np.arctan2(z_w, np.sqrt(x_w**2 + y_w**2))
    
    # Joint 3
    theta3 = np.arctan2(z_w - L2 * np.sin(theta2), np.sqrt(x_w**2 + y_w**2) - L2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Joint 4
    theta4 = np.arctan2(z_w - L2 * np.sin(theta2) - L3 * np.sin(theta3), np.sqrt(x_w**2 + y_w**2) - L2 * np.cos(theta2) - L3 * np.cos(theta3))
    
    # Joint 5
    theta5 = 0.0  # Assuming no specific orientation requirement
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle \( \theta_1 \) is calculated using the arctangent of the y and x coordinates of the target position.
- **Wrist Center Position:** The wrist center position is calculated based on the TCP position and the length of the fifth link.
- **Joint 2:** The angle \( \theta_2 \) is calculated using the arctangent of the z coordinate and the distance in the XY plane of the wrist center.
- **Joint 3:** The angle \( \theta_3 \) is calculated by considering the position of the wrist center relative to the second link.
- **Joint 4:** The angle \( \theta_4 \) is calculated by considering the position of the wrist center relative to the third link.
- **Joint 5:** The angle \( \theta_5 \) is set to 0.0, assuming no specific orientation requirement.

This corrected implementation should now work without errors and provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the manipulator. However, further refinement may be needed to ensure it reaches all targets correctly.
