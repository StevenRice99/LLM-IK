To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. We will use the existing solutions for each joint as a starting point and extend them to solve for the entire chain.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution for Joint 1 to determine the angle `theta1` based on the target position `p`.
   - The existing solution for Joint 1 is:
     ```python
     theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
     ```

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to determine the angle `theta2` based on the target position `p` after accounting for the rotation of Joint 1.
   - The existing solution for Joint 2 is:
     ```python
     theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
     ```

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We need to determine the angle `theta3` based on the target position `p` after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1 and 2.
   - The existing solution for Joint 3 is:
     ```python
     theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
     ```

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to determine the angle `theta4` based on the target position `p` after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1, 2, and 3.
   - The existing solution for Joint 4 is:
     ```python
     theta4 = math.atan2(px, pz)
     ```

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - The fifth joint rotates around the Z-axis. We need to determine the angle `theta5` based on the target orientation `r` after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The existing solution for Joint 5 is:
     ```python
     theta5 = math.atan2(y, x)
     ```

### Final Inverse Kinematics Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 5
    theta5 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle `theta1` is calculated based on the target position `p` using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the XY plane.
- **Joint 2:** The angle `theta2` is calculated based on the target position `p` after accounting for the rotation of Joint 1.
- **Joint 3:** The angle `theta3` is calculated based on the target position `p` after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1 and 2.
- **Joint 4:** The angle `theta4` is calculated based on the target position `p` after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1, 2, and 3.
- **Joint 5:** The angle `theta5` is calculated based on the target orientation `r` after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1, 2, 3, and 4.

This function returns the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.
