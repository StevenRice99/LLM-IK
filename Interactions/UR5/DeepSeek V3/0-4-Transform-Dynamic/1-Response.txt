To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. We will use the existing solutions for each joint as a starting point and extend them to solve the entire chain.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution for Joint 1 to determine the angle `theta1` that aligns the manipulator in the correct direction.
   - The position `p` is given in world coordinates. We need to project this position onto the XY plane to determine the angle `theta1`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution for Joint 2 to determine the angle `theta2` that positions the manipulator in the correct plane.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution for Joint 3 to determine the angle `theta3` that positions the manipulator in the correct plane.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution for Joint 4 to determine the angle `theta4` that positions the manipulator in the correct plane.

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - The fifth joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution for Joint 5 to determine the angle `theta5` that aligns the TCP with the desired orientation.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Joint 1: Rotates around Z-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis
    # We need to project the position onto the plane defined by Joint 1
    # and then calculate the angle theta2
    # Assuming the position is in the local frame after Joint 1 rotation
    # We can use the existing solution for Joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis
    # We can use the existing solution for Joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Joint 4: Rotates around Y-axis
    # We can use the existing solution for Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Joint 5: Rotates around Z-axis
    # We can use the existing solution for Joint 5
    theta5 = math.atan2(y, x)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle `theta1` is calculated using `atan2(-x, y)` to align the manipulator in the correct direction.
- **Joint 2:** The angle `theta2` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to position the manipulator in the correct plane.
- **Joint 3:** The angle `theta3` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to further position the manipulator.
- **Joint 4:** The angle `theta4` is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to position the manipulator.
- **Joint 5:** The angle `theta5` is calculated using `atan2(y, x)` to align the TCP with the desired orientation.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable targets. The existing solutions for each joint are used to determine the joint angles required to reach the desired position and orientation.
