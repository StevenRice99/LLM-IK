The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The main issue is that the solution does not account for the full geometry of the manipulator and the dependencies between the joints. To address this, we need to develop a more comprehensive solution that considers the entire chain and the relationships between the joints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can determine `theta1` by projecting the target position onto the XY plane and calculating the angle using `atan2(y, x)`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to consider the position of the end-effector relative to the second joint and calculate `theta2` using the law of cosines.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We can calculate `theta3` by considering the position of the end-effector relative to the third joint and using the law of cosines.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can calculate `theta4` by considering the position of the end-effector relative to the fourth joint and using the law of cosines.

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - The fifth joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can determine `theta5` by considering the desired orientation of the end-effector and calculating the angle using `atan2`.

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle `theta1` is calculated using `atan2(y, x)` to align the manipulator in the correct direction.
- **Joint 2:** The angle `theta2` is calculated using the law of cosines, with the argument to `math.acos` clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to avoid domain errors.
- **Joint 3:** The angle `theta3` is calculated using the law of cosines, with the argument to `math.acos` clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to avoid domain errors.
- **Joint 4:** The angle `theta4` is calculated based on the desired orientation.
- **Joint 5:** The angle `theta5` is calculated based on the desired orientation.

This solution ensures numerical stability by clamping the arguments to `math.acos` to the valid range `[-1, 1]`, preventing domain errors. It also considers the full geometry of the manipulator and the relationships between the joints to correctly solve for the joint angles needed to reach the desired position and orientation.
