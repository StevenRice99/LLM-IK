The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The main issue is that the existing solutions for each joint are being applied independently without considering the dependencies between the joints and the overall chain.

To address this, we need to develop a more comprehensive solution that takes into account the geometry of the manipulator and the relationships between the joints. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to solving the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can determine `theta1` by projecting the target position onto the XY plane and calculating the angle using `atan2(y, x)`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to consider the position of the end-effector relative to the second joint and calculate `theta2` using the law of cosines.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We can calculate `theta3` by considering the position of the end-effector relative to the third joint and using the law of cosines.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can calculate `theta4` by considering the position of the end-effector relative to the fourth joint and using the law of cosines.

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - The fifth joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can determine `theta5` by considering the desired orientation of the end-effector and calculating the angle using `atan2`.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    L4 = 0.093
    L5 = 0.09465

    # Joint 1: Rotates around Z-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis
    # Calculate the position of the end-effector relative to Joint 2
    x2 = x - L1 * math.cos(theta1)
    y2 = y - L1 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = z

    # Calculate the distance from Joint 2 to the end-effector
    d = math.sqrt(x2**2 + y2**2 + z2**2)

    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    theta2 = math.acos((L2**2 + d**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * d)) + math.atan2(z2, math.sqrt(x2**2 + y2**2))

    # Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis
    # Calculate theta3 using the law of cosines
    theta3 = math.acos((L2**2 + L3**2 - d**2) / (2 * L2 * L3))

    # Joint 4: Rotates around Y-axis
    # Calculate theta4 based on the desired orientation
    theta4 = ry - (theta2 + theta3)

    # Joint 5: Rotates around Z-axis
    # Calculate theta5 based on the desired orientation
    theta5 = rz

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle `theta1` is calculated using `atan2(y, x)` to align the manipulator in the correct direction.
- **Joint 2:** The angle `theta2` is calculated using the law of cosines to position the manipulator in the correct plane.
- **Joint 3:** The angle `theta3` is calculated using the law of cosines to further position the manipulator.
- **Joint 4:** The angle `theta4` is calculated based on the desired orientation.
- **Joint 5:** The angle `theta5` is calculated based on the desired orientation.

This solution takes into account the geometry of the manipulator and the relationships between the joints to correctly solve for the joint angles needed to reach the desired position and orientation.
