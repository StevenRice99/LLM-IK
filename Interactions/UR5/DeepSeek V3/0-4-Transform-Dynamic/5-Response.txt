The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the argument passed to `math.acos` is outside the valid range `[-1, 1]`. This can happen if the target position is unreachable or if there is a miscalculation in the intermediate steps. To fix this, we need to ensure that the argument passed to `math.acos` is within the valid range and handle cases where the target is unreachable (though the problem states that all targets are reachable, we still need to ensure numerical stability).

### Updated Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - Calculate `theta1` using `atan2(y, x)`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - Calculate the position of the end-effector relative to Joint 2.
   - Compute the distance `d` from Joint 2 to the end-effector.
   - Use the law of cosines to calculate `theta2`, ensuring the argument to `math.acos` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]`.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - Use the law of cosines to calculate `theta3`, ensuring the argument to `math.acos` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]`.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - Calculate `theta4` based on the desired orientation.

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - Calculate `theta5` based on the desired orientation.

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle `theta1` is calculated using `atan2(y, x)` to align the manipulator in the correct direction.
- **Joint 2:** The angle `theta2` is calculated using the law of cosines, with the argument to `math.acos` clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to avoid domain errors.
- **Joint 3:** The angle `theta3` is calculated using the law of cosines, with the argument to `math.acos` clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to avoid domain errors.
- **Joint 4:** The angle `theta4` is calculated based on the desired orientation.
- **Joint 5:** The angle `theta5` is calculated based on the desired orientation.

This solution ensures numerical stability by clamping the arguments to `math.acos` to the valid range `[-1, 1]`, preventing domain errors.
