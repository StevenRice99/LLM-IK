To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. The manipulator has the following structure:

1. **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
2. **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
3. **Revolute 3**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
4. **Revolute 4**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
5. **Revolute 5**: Rotates around the Z-axis.

### Step 1: Determine the Position of the Wrist Center
The wrist center is the point where the last three joints (Revolute 3, 4, and 5) intersect. The TCP is offset from the wrist center by the length of the last link (0.09465 m along the Z-axis).

Given the target position `p = [x, y, z]`, the wrist center position `w` can be calculated as:

\[
w = p - R \cdot [0, 0, 0.09465]^T
\]

where \( R \) is the rotation matrix corresponding to the desired orientation `r`.

### Step 2: Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁)
The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, so it affects the X and Y coordinates of the wrist center. The angle θ₁ can be calculated as:

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(w_y, w_x)
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃)
The second and third joints rotate around the Y-axis. The position of the wrist center in the X-Y plane after accounting for θ₁ can be used to determine θ₂ and θ₃.

Let \( w' = [w_x', w_y', w_z'] \) be the wrist center position after accounting for θ₁:

\[
w_x' = \sqrt{w_x^2 + w_y^2}
\]
\[
w_y' = w_z
\]

The lengths of the links are:
- \( L_2 = 0.13585 \) m
- \( L_3 = 0.425 \) m
- \( L_4 = 0.39225 \) m

Using the law of cosines, we can solve for θ₂ and θ₃:

\[
\theta_3 = \text{acos}\left(\frac{w_x'^2 + w_y'^2 - L_2^2 - L_3^2}{2 \cdot L_2 \cdot L_3}\right)
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \text{atan2}(w_y', w_x') - \text{atan2}(L_3 \cdot \sin(\theta_3), L_2 + L_3 \cdot \cos(\theta_3))
\]

### Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄)
The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ₄ can be determined by the desired orientation of the TCP after accounting for the previous joints.

### Step 5: Solve for Joint 5 (θ₅)
The fifth joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ₅ can be determined by the desired orientation of the TCP after accounting for the previous joints.

### Python Implementation
Here is the Python function implementing the above steps:

```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, acos, sin, cos

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Step 1: Calculate wrist center position
    R = np.array([
        [cos(yaw) * cos(pitch), cos(yaw) * sin(pitch) * sin(roll) - sin(yaw) * cos(roll), cos(yaw) * sin(pitch) * cos(roll) + sin(yaw) * sin(roll)],
        [sin(yaw) * cos(pitch), sin(yaw) * sin(pitch) * sin(roll) + cos(yaw) * cos(roll), sin(yaw) * sin(pitch) * cos(roll) - cos(yaw) * sin(roll)],
        [-sin(pitch), cos(pitch) * sin(roll), cos(pitch) * cos(roll)]
    ])
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0, 0.09465])
    w = np.array([x, y, z]) - R @ tcp_offset
    
    # Step 2: Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = atan2(w[1], w[0])
    
    # Step 3: Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
    wx_prime = np.sqrt(w[0]**2 + w[1]**2)
    wy_prime = w[2]
    
    L2 = 0.13585
    L3 = 0.425
    L4 = 0.39225
    
    D = (wx_prime**2 + wy_prime**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = acos(D)
    
    theta2 = atan2(wy_prime, wx_prime) - atan2(L3 * sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * cos(theta3))
    
    # Step 4: Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = pitch - theta2 - theta3
    
    # Step 5: Solve for θ₅
    theta5 = yaw - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to reach the desired position and orientation of the TCP.
