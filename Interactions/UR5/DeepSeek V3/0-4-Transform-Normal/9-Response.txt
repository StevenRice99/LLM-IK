The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is still not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The issue likely stems from incorrect assumptions or calculations in the geometric approach used. To address this, we need to refine the solution by carefully considering the manipulator's geometry and the relationship between the joints.

### Revised Approach
1. **Wrist Center Calculation**: The wrist center is still calculated as the target position minus the TCP offset transformed by the desired orientation.
2. **Joint 1 (θ₁)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis, so it affects the X and Y coordinates of the wrist center. The angle θ₁ is calculated using `atan2(w_y, w_x)`.
3. **Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃)**: These joints rotate around the Y-axis. We use the law of cosines to solve for θ₃ and then calculate θ₂ based on the geometry of the manipulator.
4. **Joint 4 (θ₄)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis and is calculated based on the desired orientation after accounting for the previous joints.
5. **Joint 5 (θ₅)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis and is calculated based on the desired orientation after accounting for the previous joints.

### Revised Python Implementation
Here is the corrected Python function:

```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, acos, sin, cos, sqrt

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Step 1: Calculate wrist center position
    R = np.array([
        [cos(yaw) * cos(pitch), cos(yaw) * sin(pitch) * sin(roll) - sin(yaw) * cos(roll), cos(yaw) * sin(pitch) * cos(roll) + sin(yaw) * sin(roll)],
        [sin(yaw) * cos(pitch), sin(yaw) * sin(pitch) * sin(roll) + cos(yaw) * cos(roll), sin(yaw) * sin(pitch) * cos(roll) - cos(yaw) * sin(roll)],
        [-sin(pitch), cos(pitch) * sin(roll), cos(pitch) * cos(roll)]
    ])
    tcp_offset = np.array([0, 0, 0.09465])
    w = np.array([x, y, z]) - R @ tcp_offset
    
    # Step 2: Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = atan2(w[1], w[0])
    
    # Step 3: Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
    wx_prime = sqrt(w[0]**2 + w[1]**2)
    wy_prime = w[2]
    
    L2 = 0.13585
    L3 = 0.425
    L4 = 0.39225
    
    D = (wx_prime**2 + wy_prime**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    # Clamp D to the valid range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors
    D = max(min(D, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta3 = acos(D)
    
    theta2 = atan2(wy_prime, wx_prime) - atan2(L3 * sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * cos(theta3))
    
    # Step 4: Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = pitch - theta2 - theta3
    
    # Step 5: Solve for θ₅
    theta5 = yaw - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Clamping `D`**: The value of `D` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to ensure it is within the valid domain for the `acos` function.
2. **Correct Calculation of θ₂ and θ₃**: The angles θ₂ and θ₃ are calculated using the law of cosines and the geometry of the manipulator.
3. **Correct Calculation of θ₄ and θ₅**: The angles θ₄ and θ5 are calculated based on the desired orientation after accounting for the previous joints.

This revised solution should now correctly calculate the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation.
