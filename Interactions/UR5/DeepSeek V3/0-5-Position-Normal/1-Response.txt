To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 6-DOF serial manipulator, we will break down the problem step by step. The goal is to find the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4, \theta_5, \theta_6 \) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = [x, y, z] \).

### Step 1: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by \( \theta_1 \). We can solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the arctangent function:

\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joints (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3) rotate around the Y-axis. We can model the arm as a 2-link planar manipulator in the XZ plane after accounting for \( \theta_1 \). The position of the end effector in the XZ plane is given by:

\[
x' = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
\[
z' = z - L_1
\]

where \( L_1 \) is the length of the first link (0.13585 m).

Using the law of cosines, we can solve for \( \theta_3 \):

\[
\cos(\theta_3) = \frac{x'^2 + z'^2 - L_2^2 - L_3^2}{2 L_2 L_3}
\]
\[
\theta_3 = \arccos(\cos(\theta_3))
\]

where \( L_2 \) is the length of the second link (0.425 m) and \( L_3 \) is the length of the third link (0.39225 m).

Next, we solve for \( \theta_2 \):

\[
\alpha = \arctan2(z', x')
\]
\[
\beta = \arctan2(L_3 \sin(\theta_3), L_2 + L_3 \cos(\theta_3))
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \alpha - \beta
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_4 \), \( \theta_5 \), and \( \theta_6 \)
The fourth, fifth, and sixth joints (Revolute 4, Revolute 5, and Revolute 6) are used to orient the TCP. These angles can be determined by solving the orientation part of the inverse kinematics problem, which typically involves solving a system of equations derived from the rotation matrix of the end effector.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution in Python
Now, we will implement the above steps in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3
    L1 = 0.13585
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    x_prime = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_prime = z - L1
    
    cos_theta3 = (x_prime**2 + z_prime**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_prime, x_prime)
    beta = np.arctan2(L3 * np.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta4, theta5, and theta6
    # For simplicity, we assume these angles are zero in this example
    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    theta6 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

### Step 5: Test the Solution
To test the solution, we can call the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position.

```
TEST_SOLUTION x y z
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution.
