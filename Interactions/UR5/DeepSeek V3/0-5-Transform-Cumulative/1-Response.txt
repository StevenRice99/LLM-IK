To solve the inverse kinematics for the 6-DOF serial manipulator, we will break down the problem step by step, using the existing solutions for each joint as a starting point. The goal is to find the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`.

### Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁)
The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution for joint 1 to find θ₁.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
```

### Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂)
The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to adjust the target position by the rotation of joint 1 and then solve for θ₂.

```python
    # Adjust the target position by the rotation of joint 1
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the position of joint 2

    theta2 = math.atan2(x_prime, z_prime)
```

### Step 3: Solve for Joint 3 (θ₃)
The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We need to adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1 and 2 and then solve for θ₃.

```python
    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1 and 2
    x_double_prime = x_prime * math.cos(theta2) - z_prime * math.sin(theta2)
    z_double_prime = x_prime * math.sin(theta2) + z_prime * math.cos(theta2)
    z_double_prime -= 0.425  # Adjust for the position of joint 3

    theta3 = math.atan2(x_double_prime, z_double_prime)
```

### Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄)
The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, and 3 and then solve for θ₄.

```python
    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, and 3
    x_triple_prime = x_double_prime * math.cos(theta3) - z_double_prime * math.sin(theta3)
    z_triple_prime = x_double_prime * math.sin(theta3) + z_double_prime * math.cos(theta3)
    z_triple_prime -= 0.39225  # Adjust for the position of joint 4

    theta4 = math.atan2(x_triple_prime, z_triple_prime)
```

### Step 5: Solve for Joint 5 (θ₅)
The fifth joint rotates around the Z-axis. We need to adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, and 4 and then solve for θ₅.

```python
    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, and 4
    x_quad_prime = x_triple_prime * math.cos(theta4) - z_triple_prime * math.sin(theta4)
    y_quad_prime = y_prime  # No change in y since joint 4 rotates around Y-axis
    z_quad_prime = x_triple_prime * math.sin(theta4) + z_triple_prime * math.cos(theta4)
    z_quad_prime -= 0.093  # Adjust for the position of joint 5

    theta5 = math.atan2(y_quad_prime, x_quad_prime)
```

### Step 6: Solve for Joint 6 (θ₆)
The sixth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We need to adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and then solve for θ₆.

```python
    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    x_penta_prime = x_quad_prime * math.cos(theta5) - y_quad_prime * math.sin(theta5)
    z_penta_prime = z_quad_prime  # No change in z since joint 5 rotates around Z-axis
    z_penta_prime -= 0.09465  # Adjust for the position of joint 6

    theta6 = math.atan2(x_penta_prime, z_penta_prime)
```

### Step 7: Return the Joint Angles
Finally, we return the joint angles θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, θ₄, θ₅, and θ₆.

```python
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6
```
