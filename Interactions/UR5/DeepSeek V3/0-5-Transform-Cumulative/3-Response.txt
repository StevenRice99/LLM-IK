The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution did not correctly position the TCP at the desired targets. The issue likely arises from the way the joint angles are being calculated, particularly in how the target position and orientation are being transformed and adjusted for each joint. Let’s refine the approach step by step, ensuring that the transformations and adjustments are correctly applied.

### Revised Approach

1. **Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ₁ is determined by the target position in the XY plane.

2. **Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The target position is adjusted by the rotation of joint 1, and then θ₂ is calculated.

3. **Solve for Joint 3 (θ₃):**
   - The third joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The target position is further adjusted by the rotations of joints 1 and 2, and then θ₃ is calculated.

4. **Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. The target position is adjusted by the rotations of joints 1, 2, and 3, and then θ₄ is calculated.

5. **Solve for Joint 5 (θ₅):**
   - The fifth joint rotates around the Z-axis. The target position is adjusted by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, and 4, and then θ₅ is calculated.

6. **Solve for Joint 6 (θ₆):**
   - The sixth joint rotates around the Y-axis. The target position is adjusted by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and then θ₆ is calculated.

    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Adjust the target position by the rotation of joint 1
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the position of joint 2
    
    # Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂)

    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1 and 2
    x_double_prime = x_prime * math.cos(theta2) - z_prime * math.sin(theta2)
    z_double_prime = x_prime * math.sin(theta2) + z_prime * math.cos(theta2)
    z_double_prime -= 0.425  # Adjust for the position of joint 3
    
    # Solve for Joint 3 (θ₃)
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_double_prime, x_double_prime)
    
    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, and 3
    x_triple_prime = x_double_prime * math.cos(theta3) - z_double_prime * math.sin(theta3)
    z_triple_prime = x_double_prime * math.sin(theta3) + z_double_prime * math.cos(theta3)
    z_triple_prime -= 0.39225  # Adjust for the position of joint 4
    
    # Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄)
    theta4 = math.atan2(z_triple_prime, x_triple_prime)
    
    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, and 4
    x_quad_prime = x_triple_prime * math.cos(theta4) - z_triple_prime * math.sin(theta4)
    y_quad_prime = y_prime  # No change in y since joint 4 rotates around Y-axis
    z_quad_prime = x_triple_prime * math.sin(theta4) + z_triple_prime * math.cos(theta4)
    z_quad_prime -= 0.093  # Adjust for the position of joint 5
    
    # Solve for Joint 5 (θ₅)
    theta5 = math.atan2(y_quad_prime, x_quad_prime)
    
    # Adjust the target position by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    x_penta_prime = x_quad_prime * math.cos(theta5) - y_quad_prime * math.sin(theta5)
    z_penta_prime = z_quad_prime  # No change in z since joint 5 rotates around Z-axis
    z_penta_prime -= 0.09465  # Adjust for the position of joint 6
    
    # Solve for Joint 6 (θ₆)
    theta6 = math.atan2(x_penta_prime, z_penta_prime)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6
```

### Explanation

- **Joint 1 (θ₁):** The angle is calculated based on the target position in the XY plane.
- **Joint 2 (θ₂):** The target position is adjusted by the rotation of joint 1, and the angle is calculated based on the adjusted position.
- **Joint 3 (θ₃):** The target position is further adjusted by the rotations of joints 1 and 2, and the angle is calculated based on the new adjusted position.
- **Joint 4 (θ₄):** The target position is adjusted by the rotations of joints 1, 2, and 3, and the angle is calculated based on the new adjusted position.
- **Joint 5 (θ₅):** The target position is adjusted by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the angle is calculated based on the new adjusted position.
- **Joint 6 (θ₆):** The target position is adjusted by the rotations of joints 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the angle is calculated based on the new adjusted position.

This revised approach ensures that the target position and orientation are correctly transformed and adjusted for each joint, leading to more accurate inverse kinematics solutions.
