The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution did not correctly position the TCP at the desired targets. The issue likely arises from the oversimplified approach to solving the joint angles, which does not account for the full kinematic chain or the orientation constraints. To address this, we need to incorporate the orientation `r` into the solution and ensure that the joint angles are calculated in a way that satisfies both the position and orientation requirements.

### Revised Approach
1. **Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁)**: Use the target position `p` to determine the rotation around the Z-axis.
2. **Solve for Joint 2 (θ₂) and Joint 3 (θ₃)**: Use the target position `p` and the orientation `r` to determine the rotations around the Y-axis.
3. **Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄), Joint 5 (θ₅), and Joint 6 (θ₆)**: Use the orientation `r` to determine the rotations around the Y and Z axes.

### Revised Code
Here is the revised inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
    d1 = 0.13585
    a2 = 0.425
    a3 = 0.39225
    d4 = 0.093
    d6 = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate the position of the wrist center
    x_wrist = x - d6 * math.cos(pitch) * math.cos(yaw)
    y_wrist = y - d6 * math.cos(pitch) * math.sin(yaw)
    z_wrist = z - d6 * math.sin(pitch)
    
    # Solve for θ₂
    r = math.sqrt(x_wrist**2 + y_wrist**2)
    D = (r**2 + (z_wrist - d1)**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Solve for θ₂
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_wrist - d1, r) - math.atan2(a3 * math.sin(theta3), a2 + a3 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    # Solve for θ₄, θ₅, and θ₆
    # Calculate the rotation matrix from the base to the wrist center
    R0_3 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta1) * math.cos(theta2 + theta3), -math.cos(theta1) * math.sin(theta2 + theta3), math.sin(theta1)],
        [math.sin(theta1) * math.cos(theta2 + theta3), -math.sin(theta1) * math.sin(theta2 + theta3), -math.cos(theta1)],
        [math.sin(theta2 + theta3), math.cos(theta2 + theta3), 0]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the desired rotation matrix from the base to the TCP
    R0_6 = np.array([
        [math.cos(yaw) * math.cos(pitch), -math.sin(yaw) * math.cos(roll) + math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.sin(roll), math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(roll) + math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.cos(roll)],
        [math.sin(yaw) * math.cos(pitch), math.cos(yaw) * math.cos(roll) + math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.sin(roll), -math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(roll) + math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.cos(roll)],
        [-math.sin(pitch), math.cos(pitch) * math.sin(roll), math.cos(pitch) * math.cos(roll)]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the rotation matrix from the wrist center to the TCP
    R3_6 = np.dot(np.linalg.inv(R0_3), R0_6)
    
    # Solve for θ₅
    theta5 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(R3_6[0, 2]**2 + R3_6[1, 2]**2), R3_6[2, 2])
    
    # Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = math.atan2(R3_6[1, 2], R3_6[0, 2])
    
    # Solve for θ₆
    theta6 = math.atan2(R3_6[2, 1], -R3_6[2, 0])
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6
```

### Explanation
1. **θ₁**: Calculated based on the target position `p` to align the manipulator in the correct direction.
2. **θ₂ and θ₃**: Calculated using the wrist center position, which is derived from the target position `p` and the orientation `r`. These angles position the wrist center correctly.
3. **θ₄, θ₅, and θ₆**: Calculated using the rotation matrix from the wrist center to the TCP, ensuring the correct orientation of the end-effector.

This approach should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the 6-DOF serial manipulator.
