To solve the inverse kinematics for the 6-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. The manipulator has a combination of revolute joints with different axes of rotation, and we will use geometric and trigonometric methods to find the joint angles.

### Step 1: Understand the Manipulator Structure
The manipulator consists of 6 revolute joints with the following properties:
- **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
- **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
- **Revolute 3**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
- **Revolute 4**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
- **Revolute 5**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
- **Revolute 6**: Rotates around the Y-axis.

The TCP is offset from the last joint by `[0, 0.0823, 0]` and has an orientation of `[0, 0, 1.570796325]` radians.

### Step 2: Position the TCP
The position of the TCP is influenced by all the joints. We can break down the problem into finding the joint angles that position the TCP at `p`.

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles
We will solve for the joint angles step by step:

1. **Joint 1 (θ₁)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can find θ₁ by projecting the desired position `p` onto the XY plane and calculating the angle between the projection and the X-axis.
   
   \[
   \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(p_y, p_x)
   \]

2. **Joint 2 (θ₂)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can find θ₂ by considering the position of the TCP relative to the base after accounting for θ₁.

3. **Joint 3 (θ₃)**: This joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We can find θ₃ by considering the position of the TCP relative to the second joint.

4. **Joint 4 (θ₄)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can find θ₄ by considering the position of the TCP relative to the third joint.

5. **Joint 5 (θ₅)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can find θ₅ by considering the orientation of the TCP.

6. **Joint 6 (θ₆)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can find θ₆ by considering the orientation of the TCP.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
We will implement the solution in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, sqrt, acos, pi

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Step 1: Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for θ₂, θ₃, θ₄
    # We need to solve the position of the TCP in the plane defined by θ₁
    # The position of the TCP in the plane is given by the distance from the base to the TCP
    # We can use the law of cosines to find the angles θ₂, θ₃, θ₄
    
    # Step 3: Solve for θ₅, θ₆
    # The orientation of the TCP is influenced by θ₅ and θ₆
    # We can use the orientation angles to find θ₅ and θ₆
    
    # Placeholder for the actual calculations
    theta2 = 0.0
    theta3 = 0.0
    theta4 = 0.0
    theta5 = 0.0
    theta6 = 0.0
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

### Step 5: Test the Solution
To test the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to verify that the joint angles returned by `inverse_kinematics` correctly position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

```
TEST_SOLUTION x y z roll pitch yaw
```

This will allow us to verify the correctness of the inverse kinematics solution.
