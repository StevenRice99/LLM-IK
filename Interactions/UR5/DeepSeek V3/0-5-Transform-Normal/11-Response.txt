The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the `inverse_kinematics` function is not correctly solving for the joint angles, resulting in the TCP failing to reach the desired position and orientation. The issue lies in the calculations for `theta2`, `theta3`, and `theta4`, which are not accounting for the full geometry of the manipulator or the orientation of the TCP.

To address this, we need to refine the calculations for these joint angles and ensure that the orientation of the TCP is properly considered. Here’s the updated implementation:

### Updated Implementation

```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, sqrt, acos, pi

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Step 1: Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for θ₂, θ₃, θ₄
    # Transform the target position into the coordinate frame of the second joint
    x_prime = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    y_prime = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the height of the first joint
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of the second link
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of the third link
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length of the fourth link
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the TCP
    d = sqrt(x_prime**2 + y_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ₃
    cos_theta3 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - d**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure cos_theta3 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)
    theta3 = acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ₂
    alpha = atan2(y_prime, x_prime)
    cos_beta = (L1**2 + d**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * d)
    # Ensure cos_beta is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_beta = max(min(cos_beta, 1), -1)
    beta = acos(cos_beta)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # Step 3: Solve for θ₅ and θ₆
    # Use the orientation angles to solve for θ₅ and θ₆
    theta5 = yaw
    theta6 = pitch
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

### Key Changes
1. **Clamping `cos_theta3` and `cos_beta`**:
   - The values of `cos_theta3` and `cos_beta` are clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to ensure they are valid for the `acos` function.

2. **Orientation Handling**:
   - The orientation angles (roll, pitch, yaw) are directly assigned to `theta5` and `theta6`. This assumes that the orientation of the TCP is directly controlled by these joints.

---

### Step 5: Test the Solution
To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position and orientation. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION -0.075089136493105 -0.43859261796554405 0.6470180646172311 -1.729125696600872 -1.056947818667297 2.8927115047047343
```

This will allow us to check if the joint angles returned by the `inverse_kinematics` function correctly position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

---

### Notes
- The solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable, as per the instructions.
- The implementation may need further refinement to handle specific configurations of the manipulator or edge cases.
