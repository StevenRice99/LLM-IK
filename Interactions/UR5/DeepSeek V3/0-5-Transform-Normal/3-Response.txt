The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the `inverse_kinematics` function is incomplete and only solves for the first joint angle (θ₁). The remaining joint angles (θ₂, θ₃, θ₄, θ₅, θ₆) are not being calculated, which is why the TCP fails to reach the desired position and orientation.

To address this, we need to implement a complete solution for all six joint angles. Here’s how we can proceed:

---

### Step 1: Solve for θ₁
The first joint angle (θ₁) is calculated using the `atan2` function to determine the angle between the X-axis and the projection of the target position onto the XY plane.

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(p_y, p_x)
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for θ₂, θ₃, and θ₄
These joints control the position of the TCP. We can use geometric methods to solve for these angles. Here’s the approach:

1. **Transform the target position into the coordinate frame of the second joint**:
   - Subtract the position of the first joint from the target position.
   - Rotate the result by -θ₁ to align it with the second joint’s frame.

2. **Use the law of cosines**:
   - The distances between the joints form a triangle, and we can use the law of cosines to solve for θ₂, θ₃, and θ₄.

### Step 3: Solve for θ₅ and θ₆
These joints control the orientation of the TCP. We can use the orientation angles (roll, pitch, yaw) to solve for θ₅ and θ₆.

---

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
Here’s the updated implementation of the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, sqrt, acos, pi

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Step 1: Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for θ₂, θ₃, θ₄
    # Transform the target position into the coordinate frame of the second joint
    x_prime = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    y_prime = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the height of the first joint
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of the second link
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of the third link
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length of the fourth link
    
    # Distance from the second joint to the TCP
    d = sqrt(x_prime**2 + y_prime**2)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ₃
    cos_theta3 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - d**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ₂
    alpha = atan2(y_prime, x_prime)
    beta = acos((L1**2 + d**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * d))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = -theta2 - theta3
    
    # Step 3: Solve for θ₅ and θ₆
    # Use the orientation angles to solve for θ₅ and θ₆
    theta5 = yaw
    theta6 = pitch
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

---

### Step 5: Test the Solution
To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position and orientation. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION -0.075089136493105 -0.43859261796554405 0.6470180646172311 -1.729125696600872 -1.056947818667297 2.8927115047047343
```

This will allow us to check if the joint angles returned by the `inverse_kinematics` function correctly position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

---

### Notes
- The solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable.
- The implementation may need further refinement to handle edge cases or specific configurations of the manipulator.
