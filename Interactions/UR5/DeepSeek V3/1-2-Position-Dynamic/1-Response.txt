To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details of the manipulator:
- Revolute 1 is at the base with its axis along the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 is connected to Revolute 1 with a position offset of [0, -0.1197, 0.425] and its axis also along the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, 0, 0.39225].

The forward kinematics can be described as:
1. Rotate by joint1 around the Y-axis.
2. Translate by [0, -0.1197, 0.425].
3. Rotate by joint2 around the Y-axis.
4. Translate by [0, 0, 0.39225].

To find the inverse kinematics, we need to solve for joint1 and joint2 given the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Position of Revolute 2**: The position of Revolute 2 relative to the base frame after rotating by joint1 and translating by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] can be described as:
   \[
   P_{2} = R_{y}(\theta_1) \cdot [0, -0.1197, 0.425]^T
   \]
   where \( R_{y}(\theta_1) \) is the rotation matrix around the Y-axis by angle \( \theta_1 \).

2. **Position of TCP**: The position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2 after rotating by joint2 and translating by [0, 0, 0.39225] can be described as:
   \[
   P_{TCP} = P_{2} + R_{y}(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \cdot [0, 0, 0.39225]^T
   \]
   where \( R_{y}(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \) is the rotation matrix around the Y-axis by angle \( \theta_1 + \theta_2 \).

3. **Solving for joint1 and joint2**: We need to solve the above equations for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) given the target position \( P_{TCP} = (x, y, z) \).

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # Distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    alpha = math.atan2(z, x)
    beta = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). The function uses the law of cosines to solve for \( \theta_2 \) and then calculates \( \theta_1 \) based on the geometry of the manipulator.
