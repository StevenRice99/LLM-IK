To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 is at the base with its axis along Y.
- Revolute 2 is connected to Revolute 1 with a position offset of [0, -0.1197, 0.425] and its axis also along Y.
- The TCP is at a position offset of [0, 0, 0.39225] from Revolute 2.

The forward kinematics can be represented as:
\[
\begin{align*}
x &= (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \cos(\theta_1) \\
y &= y_1 + y_2 \\
z &= (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \sin(\theta_1)
\end{align*}
\]
where:
- \( l_1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
- \( l_2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)
- \( \theta_1 \) is the angle of Revolute 1
- \( \theta_2 \) is the angle of Revolute 2

To find the inverse kinematics, we need to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) given the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step 1: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
From the forward kinematics equations, we can see that:
\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(z, x)
\]
This is because \( \theta_1 \) determines the direction of the projection of the TCP position on the XZ plane.

### Step 2: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
Once \( \theta_1 \) is known, we can use the distance from the origin to the TCP in the XZ plane to solve for \( \theta_2 \). The distance \( d \) in the XZ plane is:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
\]
Using the law of cosines in the triangle formed by the two links and the distance \( d \):
\[
d^2 = l_1^2 + l_2^2 + 2 l_1 l_2 \cos(\theta_2)
\]
Solving for \( \theta_2 \):
\[
\theta_2 = \text{acos}\left(\frac{d^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 l_1 l_2}\right)
\]

### Implementation
Now, let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta2
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    theta2 = math.acos((d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the required joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
