Given the persistent issues with the current approach, let's try a different method to calculate `theta1` and `theta2`. We will use the geometric approach to solve the inverse kinematics problem.

### Revised Approach

1. **Calculate `theta2`**: Use the law of cosines to find the angle between the two links.

2. **Calculate `theta1`**: Use the atan2 function to find the angle from the base to the target position in the XZ plane and then adjust it based on the geometry of the manipulator.

### Revised Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # Distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z, x) - math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    # Adjust theta1 to ensure it is within the correct quadrant
    if x < 0:
        theta1 += math.pi
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation

- **Distance Calculation**: The distance `d` from the base to the target in the XZ plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Joint2 Calculation**: The angle `theta2` is calculated using the law of cosines.
- **Joint1 Calculation**: The angle `theta1` is calculated using the `atan2` function to find the angle from the base to the target position in the XZ plane and then adjusting it based on the geometry of the manipulator. The adjustment ensures that `theta1` is within the correct quadrant by adding `math.pi` if the target position is in the negative X direction.

This revised approach should correctly calculate the joint angles for the given target positions.
