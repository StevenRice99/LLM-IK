The feedback indicates that the revised implementation still fails to reach the correct target positions. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of `theta1`. Let's try a different approach to calculate `theta1` by considering the geometry of the manipulator more carefully.

### Revised Approach

1. **Calculate `theta2`**: This part of the calculation seems correct as it uses the law of cosines to find the angle between the two links.

2. **Calculate `theta1`**: Instead of using `alpha` and `beta`, we will directly calculate `theta1` using the atan2 function and adjust it based on the geometry of the manipulator.

### Revised Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    
    # Distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z, x) - math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation

- **Distance Calculation**: The distance `d` from the base to the target in the XZ plane is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
- **Joint2 Calculation**: The angle `theta2` is calculated using the law of cosines.
- **Joint1 Calculation**: The angle `theta1` is calculated using the `atan2` function to find the angle from the base to the target position in the XZ plane and then adjusting it based on the geometry of the manipulator.

This revised approach should correctly calculate the joint angles for the given target positions.
