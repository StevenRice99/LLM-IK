The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is producing incorrect joint angles, particularly for \(\theta_1\). The issue arises because the current solution does not account for the correct quadrant of the angles and does not handle the sign of \(\theta_2\) properly. Let's revise the solution step by step.

---

### Revised Solution:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis.
   - The first joint is at the origin \([0, 0, 0]\).
   - The second joint is at \([0, -0.1197, 0.425]\) relative to the first joint.
   - The TCP is at \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to the second joint.

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be expressed as:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     x &= L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2), \\
     z &= L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2),
     \end{aligned}
     \]
     where \(L_1 = 0.425\) and \(L_2 = 0.39225\).

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Calculate the distance \(d\) from the origin to the target point:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
     \]
   - Use the law of cosines to find \(\theta_2\):
     \[
     \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \pm \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)
     \]
   - Solve for \(\theta_1\):
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z) - \arctan2(L_2 \sin(\theta_2), L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2))
     \]

4. **Handling Quadrant Ambiguity:**
   - The sign of \(\theta_2\) must be chosen correctly to ensure the TCP reaches the target position.
   - If \(\theta_2\) is positive, the arm is in an "elbow-up" configuration.
   - If \(\theta_2\) is negative, the arm is in an "elbow-down" configuration.

### Revised Python Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target point
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Handle the sign of theta2 (elbow-up or elbow-down)
    # Use the cross product to determine the correct configuration
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    # Calculate theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

---

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Sign of \(\theta_2\):**
   - The cross product is used to determine whether \(\theta_2\) should be positive or negative. This ensures the correct configuration (elbow-up or elbow-down) is chosen.

2. **Handling Quadrant Ambiguity:**
   - The `atan2` function is used to calculate \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), ensuring the correct quadrant for \(\theta_1\).

3. **General Robustness:**
   - The solution now accounts for the correct configuration of the arm, ensuring the TCP reaches the target position.

### Testing:
To verify the correctness of the solution, you can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the provided target positions and compare the results with the expected joint values. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION 0.22761911732701 -0.1197 0.578992943548258
```

This will test the revised inverse kinematics function and confirm whether it produces the correct joint values.
