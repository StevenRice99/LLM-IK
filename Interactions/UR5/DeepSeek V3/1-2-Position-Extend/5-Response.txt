The forward kinematics results show that the correct joint values \([-0.29750955248180505, 1.412498801150204]\) position the TCP at \([0.22761911732701, -0.1197, 0.5789929435482581]\), which matches the target position.

Let's analyze the discrepancies in the initial solution:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Joint Angles:**
   - The initial solution incorrectly calculates the joint angles, leading to the TCP reaching the wrong position.
   - The main issue is in the calculation of `theta1` and `theta2`.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to correctly calculate the joint angles using the correct trigonometric relationships.
   - The correct approach involves using the law of cosines and the atan2 function to determine the angles.

Let's revise the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.425  # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 2 to TCP
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target in the x-z plane
    d = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > L1 + L2 or d < abs(L1 - L2):
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    alpha = math.atan2(z_target, x_target)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Calculate the distance \( d \) from the origin to the target in the x-z plane.**
2. **Check if the target is reachable** by comparing \( d \) with the sum and difference of the link lengths.
3. **Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines.**
4. **Calculate joint1** by determining the angles \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) and then finding the difference.

This revised function should correctly calculate the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) needed to position the TCP at the target position \( p \).
