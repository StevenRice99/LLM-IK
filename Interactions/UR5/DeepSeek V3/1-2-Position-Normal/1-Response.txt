To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 is at the origin with its axis along the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 is offset from Revolute 1 by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] with its axis also along the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, 0, 0.39225].

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.425 \) (length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along the Z-axis)
- \( L_2 = 0.39225 \) (length from Revolute 2 to TCP along the Z-axis)
- \( d = 0.1197 \) (offset along the Y-axis between Revolute 1 and Revolute 2)

The position of the TCP can be expressed in terms of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) as follows:
\[
x = (L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + (L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2))
\]
\[
z = (L_1 \cos(\theta_1)) + (L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2))
\]
\[
y = -d
\]

Given that the Y-coordinate is fixed at \( y = -d \), we only need to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using the X and Z coordinates.

Let's proceed to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

1. **Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane:**
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
\]

2. **Use the Law of Cosines to find \( \theta_2 \):**
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \pm \arccos\left(\frac{r^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)
\]

3. **Use the Law of Sines to find \( \theta_1 \):**
\[
\alpha = \arctan2(z, x)
\]
\[
\beta = \arccos\left(\frac{L_1^2 + r^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 r}\right)
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \alpha - \beta
\]

Now, let's implement this logic in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = 0.1197
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the Law of Cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the Law of Sines
    alpha = math.atan2(z, x)
    beta = math.acos((L1**2 + r**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * r))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired coordinates \( (x, y, z) \).
