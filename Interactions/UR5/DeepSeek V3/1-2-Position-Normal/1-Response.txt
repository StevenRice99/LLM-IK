To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 is at the origin with its axis of rotation along the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 is offset from Revolute 1 by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] and also rotates around the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, 0, 0.39225].

The forward kinematics can be represented as:
\[
\begin{align*}
x &= (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \cos(\theta_1) \\
y &= (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \sin(\theta_1) \\
z &= l_2 \sin(\theta_2) + d_1
\end{align*}
\]
where:
- \( l_1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
- \( l_2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)
- \( d_1 = -0.1197 \) (offset in the Y-axis)
- \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are the joint angles for Revolute 1 and Revolute 2, respectively.

To find the inverse kinematics, we need to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) given \( x, y, z \).

1. First, we can find \( \theta_2 \) using the z-coordinate:
\[
z = l_2 \sin(\theta_2) + d_1 \\
\Rightarrow \sin(\theta_2) = \frac{z - d_1}{l_2} \\
\Rightarrow \theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{z - d_1}{l_2}\right)
\]

2. Next, we can find \( \theta_1 \) using the x and y coordinates:
\[
x = (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \cos(\theta_1) \\
y = (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \sin(\theta_1) \\
\Rightarrow \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

Now, let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    l1 = 0.425
    l2 = 0.39225
    d1 = -0.1197
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.asin((z - d1) / l2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired coordinates \( (x, y, z) \).
