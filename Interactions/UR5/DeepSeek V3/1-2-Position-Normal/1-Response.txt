To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the Tool Center Point (TCP) at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 is at the origin with its axis of rotation along the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 is offset from Revolute 1 by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] and also rotates around the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, 0, 0.39225].

The forward kinematics can be described as follows:
1. The position of Revolute 2 relative to the base frame is determined by the rotation of Revolute 1.
2. The position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2 is determined by the rotation of Revolute 2.

To find the inverse kinematics, we need to solve for the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position \( p \).

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
- \( L_2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)
- \( d = 0.1197 \) (offset in the Y-axis)

The position of the TCP can be described by the following equations:
\[
x = (L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)) \cos(\phi)
\]
\[
y = (L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)) \sin(\phi) - d
\]
\[
z = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

However, since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the problem simplifies to a 2D problem in the XZ plane. We can ignore the Y-coordinate for the purpose of calculating the joint angles.

Thus, the equations simplify to:
\[
x = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
z = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

We can solve these equations for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

Let's proceed to write the Python function for the inverse kinematics:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    D = (x**2 + z**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(np.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(z, x) - np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p \). The function uses the law of cosines to solve for \( \theta_2 \) and then uses the arctangent function to solve for \( \theta_1 \).
