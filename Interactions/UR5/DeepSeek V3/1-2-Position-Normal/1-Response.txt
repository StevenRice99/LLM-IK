To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that will position the TCP at the desired point \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step 1: Forward Kinematics
First, let's derive the forward kinematics of the manipulator. The position of the TCP can be expressed in terms of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

Given:
- The first revolute joint rotates around the Y-axis.
- The second revolute joint is located at \( [0, -0.1197, 0.425] \) relative to the first joint and also rotates around the Y-axis.
- The TCP is located at \( [0, 0, 0.39225] \) relative to the second joint.

The position of the TCP in the global frame can be calculated as follows:

1. **First Joint Transformation:**
   - Rotation matrix \( R_1 \) around the Y-axis by \( \theta_1 \):
     \[
     R_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta_1) & 0 & \sin(\theta_1) \\
     0 & 1 & 0 \\
     -\sin(\theta_1) & 0 & \cos(\theta_1)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The position of the first joint is \( [0, 0, 0] \).

2. **Second Joint Transformation:**
   - The second joint is located at \( [0, -0.1197, 0.425] \) relative to the first joint.
   - Rotation matrix \( R_2 \) around the Y-axis by \( \theta_2 \):
     \[
     R_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
     \cos(\theta_2) & 0 & \sin(\theta_2) \\
     0 & 1 & 0 \\
     -\sin(\theta_2) & 0 & \cos(\theta_2)
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The position of the second joint in the global frame is:
     \[
     p_2 = R_1 \cdot [0, -0.1197, 0.425]^T
     \]

3. **TCP Transformation:**
   - The TCP is located at \( [0, 0, 0.39225] \) relative to the second joint.
   - The position of the TCP in the global frame is:
     \[
     p_{\text{TCP}} = p_2 + R_1 \cdot R_2 \cdot [0, 0, 0.39225]^T
     \]

### Step 2: Inverse Kinematics
We need to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) such that \( p_{\text{TCP}} = [x, y, z] \).

Letâ€™s denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
- \( L_2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)
- \( d = -0.1197 \) (offset in the Y-axis)

The position of the TCP can be expressed as:
\[
x = (L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)) \cdot \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = d + (L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)) \cdot \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

### Step 3: Solving for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)
We can solve these equations to find \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \):**
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(y - d, x)
   \]

2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \):**
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan2(z - L_1 \sin(\theta_1), \sqrt{x^2 + (y - d)^2} - L_1 \cos(\theta_1)) - \theta_1
   \]

### Step 4: Implementation
Now, we can implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = -0.1197
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y - d, x)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + (y - d)**2)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(z - L1 * np.sin(theta1), r - L1 * np.cos(theta1)) - theta1
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired point \( p \).
