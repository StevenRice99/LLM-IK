The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). The main issue appears to be in the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), particularly in handling the correct quadrant for the arctangent function and ensuring the correct sign of the angles.

### Revised Approach
To address this, we need to carefully handle the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using the `atan2` function, which correctly determines the angle in the correct quadrant. Additionally, we need to ensure that the solution accounts for the geometry of the manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \):**
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(y - d, x)
   \]
   This ensures that \( \theta_1 \) is calculated in the correct quadrant based on the signs of \( x \) and \( y - d \).

2. **Calculate \( \theta_2 \):**
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + (y - d)^2}
   \]
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 + z^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta_2) = \pm \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta_2)}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan2(\sin(\theta_2), \cos(\theta_2))
   \]

3. **Adjust \( \theta_2 \) based on the geometry:**
   The sign of \( \sin(\theta_2) \) determines the configuration of the manipulator (elbow up or elbow down). We need to ensure that the correct configuration is chosen based on the target position.

### Revised Implementation
Here is the revised implementation of the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = -0.1197
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y - d, x)
    
    # Calculate r and z_prime
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + (y - d)**2)
    z_prime = z
    
    # Calculate cos(theta2) using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + z_prime**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta2 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1, 1)
    
    # Calculate sin(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = np.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = np.arctan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the geometry (elbow up or elbow down)
    # Here we choose the elbow up configuration
    theta2 = -theta2
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation
- **`theta1` Calculation:** The `arctan2` function is used to calculate \( \theta_1 \) in the correct quadrant.
- **`theta2` Calculation:** The law of cosines is used to calculate \( \cos(\theta_2) \), and the `arctan2` function is used to determine \( \theta_2 \). The sign of \( \sin(\theta_2) \) is chosen to ensure the correct configuration (elbow up or elbow down).
- **Adjustment:** The sign of \( \theta_2 \) is adjusted to ensure the correct configuration of the manipulator.

This revised implementation should correctly solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator.
