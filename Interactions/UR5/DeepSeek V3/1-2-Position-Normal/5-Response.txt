The forward kinematics results show that the correct joint values \([-0.29750955248180505, 1.412498801150204]\) position the TCP at \([0.22761911732701, -0.1197, 0.5789929435482581]\). 

However, the initial inverse kinematics solution produced joint values \([0.5241479674569552, 1.4124988011502042]\), which resulted in the TCP being positioned at \([0.5789929435482581, -0.1197, 0.22761911732700993]\). This indicates that the initial solution for \(\theta_1\) was incorrect.

Let's re-examine the inverse kinematics solution. The issue lies in the calculation of \(\theta_1\). The initial approach used the Law of Sines, but it seems to have a sign error or an incorrect quadrant selection. We need to ensure that \(\theta_1\) is calculated correctly by considering the correct quadrant based on the signs of \(x\) and \(z\).

Here's the corrected approach:

1. **Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane:**
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
\]

2. **Use the Law of Cosines to find \(\theta_2\):**
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \pm \arccos\left(\frac{r^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)
\]

3. **Use the Law of Sines to find \(\theta_1\):**
\[
\alpha = \arctan2(z, x)
\]
\[
\beta = \arccos\left(\frac{L_1^2 + r^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 r}\right)
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \alpha - \beta
\]

However, we need to ensure that \(\theta_1\) is in the correct quadrant. The `atan2` function already handles the quadrant based on the signs of \(x\) and \(z\), so we should use it directly.

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function accordingly:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = 0.1197
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the Law of Cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the Law of Sines
    alpha = math.atan2(z, x)
    beta = math.acos((L1**2 + r**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * r))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function should now correctly calculate the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) required to position the TCP at the desired coordinates \( (x, y, z) \).
