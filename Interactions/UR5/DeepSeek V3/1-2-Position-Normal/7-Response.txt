The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution is not correctly handling the sign and quadrant selection for \(\theta_1\). The issue arises because the initial approach does not account for the correct quadrant when calculating \(\theta_1\). 

To address this, we need to ensure that \(\theta_1\) is calculated correctly by considering the correct quadrant based on the signs of \(x\) and \(z\). Additionally, we need to handle the case where \(\theta_2\) can be positive or negative, which affects the calculation of \(\theta_1\).

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function to handle these cases correctly:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = 0.1197
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the TCP in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the Law of Cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the Law of Sines
    alpha = math.atan2(z, x)
    beta = math.acos((L1**2 + r**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * r))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Handle the case where theta2 is negative
    if z < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
        theta1 = alpha + beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function should now correctly calculate the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) required to position the TCP at the desired coordinates \( (x, y, z) \). The function now handles the correct quadrant selection for \(\theta_1\) and the sign of \(\theta_2\) based on the position of the target.
