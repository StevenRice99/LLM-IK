The feedback indicates that the revised implementation still fails to reach the target positions correctly. The issue lies in the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), particularly in handling the correct configuration (elbow up or elbow down) and the sign of \( \theta_2 \). Additionally, the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) seems to be incorrect in some cases.

### Correct Approach
To fix this, we need to:
1. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \) correctly** using `arctan2`.
2. **Calculate \( \theta_2 \) using the law of cosines**, ensuring the correct configuration (elbow up or elbow down).
3. **Handle the sign of \( \theta_2 \)** based on the target position.

### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \):**
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(y - d, x)
   \]

2. **Calculate \( r \) and \( z' \):**
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + (y - d)^2}
   \]
   \[
   z' = z
   \]

3. **Calculate \( \theta_2 \) using the law of cosines:**
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 + z'^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta_2) = \pm \sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta_2)}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan2(\sin(\theta_2), \cos(\theta_2))
   \]

4. **Adjust \( \theta_2 \) based on the configuration:**
   - If \( z' > 0 \), choose the elbow-up configuration (positive \( \theta_2 \)).
   - If \( z' < 0 \), choose the elbow-down configuration (negative \( \theta_2 \)).

### Revised Implementation
Here is the corrected implementation of the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = -0.1197
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y - d, x)
    
    # Calculate r and z_prime
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + (y - d)**2)
    z_prime = z
    
    # Calculate cos(theta2) using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + z_prime**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta2 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = np.clip(cos_theta2, -1, 1)
    
    # Calculate sin(theta2)
    sin_theta2 = np.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)
    
    # Adjust sin(theta2) based on the configuration (elbow up or elbow down)
    if z_prime < 0:
        sin_theta2 = -sin_theta2
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = np.arctan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation
- **`theta1` Calculation:** The `arctan2` function is used to calculate \( \theta_1 \) in the correct quadrant.
- **`theta2` Calculation:** The law of cosines is used to calculate \( \cos(\theta_2) \), and the `arctan2` function is used to determine \( \theta_2 \). The sign of \( \sin(\theta_2) \) is adjusted based on the target \( z \)-coordinate to ensure the correct configuration (elbow up or elbow down).
- **Configuration Handling:** The sign of \( \sin(\theta_2) \) is chosen based on the target \( z \)-coordinate to ensure the correct manipulator configuration.

This revised implementation should correctly solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator.
