Given the feedback, it's clear that the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly calculating the joint angles for some target positions. The main issue seems to be with the handling of the configurations (elbow-up and elbow-down) and ensuring the correct selection based on the target position.

Let's re-examine the approach and correct the calculations. We need to ensure that the solution considers both possible configurations (elbow-up and elbow-down) for each target position and selects the correct one based on the target position.

Here's the corrected inverse kinematics function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target position in the XZ plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if r > L1 + L2 or r < abs(L1 - L2):
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach")
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    D = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = np.arccos(D)
    
    # Calculate theta1 for elbow-up configuration
    theta1_up = np.arctan2(z, x) - np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * np.cos(theta2))
    
    # Calculate theta1 for elbow-down configuration
    theta2_down = -theta2
    theta1_down = np.arctan2(z, x) - np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(theta2_down), L1 + L2 * np.cos(theta2_down))
    
    # Choose the configuration that is within the joint limits
    if -6.2831853 <= theta1_up <= 6.2831853 and -6.2831853 <= theta2 <= 6.2831853:
        return theta1_up, theta2
    elif -6.2831853 <= theta1_down <= 6.2831853 and -6.2831853 <= theta2_down <= 6.2831853:
        return theta1_down, theta2_down
    else:
        raise ValueError("No valid joint configuration found")
```

This revised function calculates both possible configurations (elbow-up and elbow-down) and selects the one that is within the joint limits. It also checks if the target position is reachable before attempting to calculate the joint angles. This should help in reaching the target positions more accurately.
