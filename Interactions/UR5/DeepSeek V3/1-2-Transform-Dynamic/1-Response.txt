To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ₁ and θ₂) that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Kinematic Chain:**
   - **Revolute 1:** Rotates around the Y-axis, with its position at `[0, 0, 0]`.
   - **Revolute 2:** Rotates around the Y-axis, with its position at `[0, -0.1197, 0.425]` relative to Revolute 1.
   - **TCP:** Positioned at `[0, 0, 0.39225]` relative to Revolute 2.

2. **Position of TCP in World Coordinates:**
   The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be expressed as:
   \[
   \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}} = \mathbf{R}_1(\theta_1) \cdot (\mathbf{R}_2(\theta_2) \cdot \mathbf{p}_2 + \mathbf{p}_1)
   \]
   where:
   - \(\mathbf{R}_1(\theta_1)\) is the rotation matrix for Revolute 1.
   - \(\mathbf{R}_2(\theta_2)\) is the rotation matrix for Revolute 2.
   - \(\mathbf{p}_1 = [0, 0, 0]\) is the position of Revolute 1.
   - \(\mathbf{p}_2 = [0, -0.1197, 0.425]\) is the position of Revolute 2 relative to Revolute 1.
   - \(\mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}} = [0, 0, 0.39225]\) is the position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2.

3. **Solve for θ₁ and θ₂:**
   - **θ₁:** This joint controls the rotation around the Y-axis. We can use the `atan2` function to determine θ₁ based on the x and z coordinates of the target position.
   - **θ₂:** This joint controls the rotation around the Y-axis relative to Revolute 1. We can use the `atan2` function to determine θ₂ based on the x and z coordinates of the target position relative to Revolute 1.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   We will use the existing functions to solve for θ₁ and θ₂.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ₁ using the existing function
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of Revolute 2 in world coordinates
    p2_x = 0.425 * math.sin(theta1)
    p2_z = 0.425 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2
    tcp_x = x - p2_x
    tcp_z = z - p2_z
    
    # Solve for θ₂ using the existing function
    theta2 = math.atan2(tcp_x, tcp_z)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **θ₁:** We use `math.atan2(x, z)` to determine the angle that aligns the TCP with the target position in the X-Z plane.
- **θ₂:** We first calculate the position of Revolute 2 in world coordinates using θ₁. Then, we calculate the position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2 and use `math.atan2(tcp_x, tcp_z)` to determine θ₂.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not check for joint limits or singularities.
