To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\) with the desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - **Link 1:** Revolute joint with axis along Y, position \([0, 0, 0]\), orientation \([0, 0, 0]\).
   - **Link 2:** Revolute joint with axis along Y, position \([0, -0.1197, 0.425]\), orientation \([0, 0, 0]\).
   - **TCP:** Position \([0, 0, 0.39225]\), orientation \([0, 0, 0]\).

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be expressed as:
     \[
     \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}} = \mathbf{R}_1(\theta_1) \cdot (\mathbf{R}_2(\theta_2) \cdot \mathbf{p}_2 + \mathbf{p}_1) + \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}}
     \]
   - Here, \(\mathbf{R}_1(\theta_1)\) and \(\mathbf{R}_2(\theta_2)\) are the rotation matrices for the joints, and \(\mathbf{p}_1\), \(\mathbf{p}_2\), and \(\mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}}\) are the positions of the links and TCP.

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - We need to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) such that the TCP reaches the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\).
   - The problem can be simplified by considering the projection of the TCP position onto the XZ plane, as both joints rotate around the Y-axis.

4. **Solving for \(\theta_1\):**
   - The angle \(\theta_1\) can be found using the `atan2` function:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
     \]

5. **Solving for \(\theta_2\):**
   - After determining \(\theta_1\), we can solve for \(\theta_2\) by considering the relative position of the TCP with respect to the second joint.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the second joint can be expressed as:
     \[
     \mathbf{p}_{\text{rel}} = \mathbf{R}_1^{-1}(\theta_1) \cdot \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}} - \mathbf{p}_2
     \]
   - The angle \(\theta_2\) can then be found using the `atan2` function on the relative position:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(p_{\text{rel},x}, p_{\text{rel},z})
     \]

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    # Position of TCP relative to joint 2
    p_rel_x = x - 0.0  # Joint 2 is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    p_rel_z = z - 0.425
    theta2 = math.atan2(p_rel_x, p_rel_z)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1:** This is the angle that aligns the first joint with the desired position in the XZ plane.
- **theta2:** This is the angle that aligns the second joint with the relative position of the TCP after accounting for the first joint's rotation.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not account for joint limits or singularities.
