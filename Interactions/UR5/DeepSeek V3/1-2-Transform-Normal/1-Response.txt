To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that will position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \).

### Step 1: Understand the Manipulator Structure
The manipulator consists of two revolute joints:
- **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis, located at the origin \([0, 0, 0]\).
- **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Y-axis, located at \([0, -0.1197, 0.425]\) relative to Revolute 1.
- **TCP**: Located at \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to Revolute 2.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be derived using the forward kinematics equations. The position of the TCP is given by:
\[
\text{TCP}_{\text{world}} = R_1 \cdot (R_2 \cdot \text{TCP}_{\text{local}} + \text{Revolute 2}_{\text{local}}) + \text{Revolute 1}_{\text{local}}
\]
Where \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \) are the rotation matrices for Revolute 1 and Revolute 2, respectively.

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
Given the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \), we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

1. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \)**:
   The Y-axis rotation affects the X and Z coordinates. We can calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the arctangent function:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
   \]

2. **Calculate \( \theta_2 \)**:
   After determining \( \theta_1 \), we can calculate \( \theta_2 \) by considering the remaining distance in the Y-Z plane. The distance from Revolute 1 to the TCP in the Y-Z plane is:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
   \]
   The distance from Revolute 2 to the TCP is fixed at \( 0.39225 \). Using the law of cosines, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \):
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 + 0.425^2 - 0.39225^2}{2 \cdot d \cdot 0.425}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 + 0.425^2 - 0.39225^2}{2 \cdot d \cdot 0.425}\right)
   \]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
The Python function to compute the inverse kinematics is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 + 0.425**2 - 0.39225**2) / (2 * d * 0.425)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

```python
TEST_SOLUTION x y z r_x r_y r_z
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution.
