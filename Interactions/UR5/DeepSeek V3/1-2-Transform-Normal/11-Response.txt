The feedback indicates that the current solution is still not correctly calculating the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to reach the desired TCP position and orientation. The issue lies in the way \( \theta_2 \) is being adjusted based on the target orientation \( r_y \). Specifically, the adjustment \( \theta_2 = r_y - \theta_1 \) does not account for the geometric constraints of the manipulator.

Letâ€™s revisit the problem and develop a more accurate solution.

---

### Step 1: Problem Analysis
The manipulator consists of two revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis, located at the origin \([0, 0, 0]\).
2. **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Y-axis, located at \([0, -0.1197, 0.425]\) relative to Revolute 1.
3. **TCP**: Located at \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to Revolute 2.

The target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \) must be achieved by solving for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

---

### Step 2: Mathematical Formulation
1. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \)**:
   The joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the target position in the X-Z plane:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
   \]

2. **Calculate \( \theta_2 \)**:
   The joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is determined by the distance \( d \) from Revolute 1 to the TCP in the X-Z plane:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
   \]
   Using the law of cosines, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \):
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 + 0.425^2 - 0.39225^2}{2 \cdot d \cdot 0.425}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 + 0.425^2 - 0.39225^2}{2 \cdot d \cdot 0.425}\right)
   \]

3. **Adjust for Orientation**:
   The target orientation \( r_y \) is the sum of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \):
   \[
   r_y = \theta_1 + \theta_2
   \]
   If \( r_y \) is provided, we can adjust \( \theta_2 \) to satisfy this constraint.

---

### Step 3: Implement the Correct Solution
Here is the updated Python function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Calculate theta1 (based on the target position in the X-Z plane)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (using the law of cosines)
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 + 0.425**2 - 0.39225**2) / (2 * d * 0.425)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust theta2 to match the target orientation
    theta2 = r_y - theta1
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

---

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

```python
TEST_SOLUTION x y z r_x r_y r_z
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution. If the solution is still incorrect, we can further refine the approach by considering additional geometric constraints or using numerical methods.
