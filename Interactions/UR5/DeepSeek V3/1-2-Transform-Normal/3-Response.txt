The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to reach the desired TCP position and orientation. Letâ€™s analyze the problem and refine the solution.

---

### Step 1: Problem Analysis
The initial solution assumes that the TCP position can be solved using only the X and Z coordinates, ignoring the Y-axis. However, the manipulator has a fixed Y-offset of \(-0.1197\) for Revolute 2, which must be considered. Additionally, the orientation \( r_y \) (rotation around the Y-axis) is not being accounted for in the initial solution.

---

### Step 2: Refined Approach
To solve the inverse kinematics correctly, we need to:
1. **Account for the Y-offset**: The Y-coordinate of the TCP is fixed at \(-0.1197\), so the target position must satisfy this constraint.
2. **Incorporate the orientation**: The orientation \( r_y \) directly affects the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
3. **Use the correct geometric relationships**: The manipulator forms a triangle in the X-Z plane, and we can use the law of cosines to solve for \( \theta_2 \).

---

### Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
1. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \)**:
   The joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the target orientation \( r_y \):
   \[
   \theta_1 = r_y
   \]

2. **Calculate \( \theta_2 \)**:
   The joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is determined by the position of the TCP in the X-Z plane. The distance \( d \) from Revolute 1 to the TCP is:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
   \]
   Using the law of cosines, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \):
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 + 0.425^2 - 0.39225^2}{2 \cdot d \cdot 0.425}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 + 0.425^2 - 0.39225^2}{2 \cdot d \cdot 0.425}\right)
   \]

---

### Step 4: Implement the Refined Solution
Here is the updated Python function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Calculate theta1 (directly from the orientation)
    theta1 = r_y
    
    # Calculate theta2 (using the law of cosines)
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 + 0.425**2 - 0.39225**2) / (2 * d * 0.425)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

---

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

```python
TEST_SOLUTION x y z r_x r_y r_z
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution. If the solution is still incorrect, we can further refine the approach by considering additional geometric constraints or using numerical methods.
