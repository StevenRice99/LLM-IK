The error occurs because the `^` operator in Python is the **bitwise XOR operator**, not the exponentiation operator. To fix this, we need to use the `**` operator for exponentiation. Letâ€™s correct the code and ensure the mathematical formulation is accurate.

### Step 1: Correct the Exponentiation Operator
Replace `^` with `**` for exponentiation in the calculation of `cos_theta2`.

---

### Step 2: Implement the Correct Solution
Here is the updated Python function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Calculate theta1 (based on the target position in the X-Z plane)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate theta2 (using the law of cosines)
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 + 0.425**2 - 0.39225**2) / (2 * d * 0.425)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust theta2 to match the target orientation
    theta2 = r_y - theta1
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

```python
TEST_SOLUTION x y z r_x r_y r_z
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution. If the solution is still incorrect, we can further refine the approach by considering additional geometric constraints or using numerical methods.
