To solve the inverse kinematics problem for both position and orientation, we need to consider the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the joint angles of the two revolute joints. Since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the orientation of the TCP will primarily be affected by the sum of the joint angles.

Given that the orientation is represented in roll, pitch, and yaw (RPY) angles, and both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the yaw component of the orientation will be the sum of the joint angles. The roll and pitch components will remain zero because the joints do not rotate around the X or Z axes.

Here’s how we can modify the existing position-only inverse kinematics solution to include the orientation:

1. **Position Solution**: Use the existing position-only inverse kinematics solution to find the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` that position the TCP at the desired location.

2. **Orientation Solution**: The yaw component of the orientation is the sum of the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2`. Therefore, we need to adjust the joint angles to match the desired yaw orientation.

3. **Adjustment for Orientation**: If the desired yaw orientation is `r_y`, then we need to ensure that `theta1 + theta2 = r_y`. This can be achieved by adjusting `theta2` accordingly.

Here’s the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Solve for position
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Adjust for orientation
    # The yaw component of the orientation is the sum of theta1 and theta2
    # So we need to ensure that theta1 + theta2 = r_y
    # We can adjust theta2 to achieve this
    theta2 = r_y - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
- **Position Solution**: The position solution is taken directly from the existing code, which calculates `theta1` and `theta2` to position the TCP at the desired location.
- **Orientation Solution**: The yaw component of the orientation is the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`. We adjust `theta2` to ensure that `theta1 + theta2` equals the desired yaw orientation `r_y`.

This solution assumes that the desired orientation is achievable given the joint limits. Since the problem states that all targets are reachable, we do not need to check for joint limits in this solution.
