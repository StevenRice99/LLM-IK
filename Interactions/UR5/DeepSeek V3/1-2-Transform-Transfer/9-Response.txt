The feedback indicates that the current solution still fails to reach the desired position and orientation in many cases. The primary issue lies in the way the orientation is being handled. Specifically, the current approach of adjusting `theta1` and `theta2` to match the desired yaw orientation while maintaining the position constraint is not sufficient. This is because the orientation of the TCP is influenced by both joint angles in a more complex way, and the current approach does not account for this.

To address this, we need to consider the full transformation of the TCP's orientation based on the joint angles. Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve the problem correctly:

---

### Step 1: Position Solution
The position solution remains the same as in the existing code. We calculate `theta1` and `theta2` to position the TCP at the desired location.

---

### Step 2: Orientation Solution
The orientation of the TCP is determined by the cumulative rotation of both joints. Since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the total rotation of the TCP is the sum of the joint angles. However, the desired orientation is given in roll, pitch, and yaw (RPY) angles. The yaw component of the orientation is directly influenced by the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`.

To match the desired yaw orientation `r_y`, we need to ensure that:
```
theta1 + theta2 = r_y
```

However, the current approach of simply adjusting `theta1` and `theta2` to satisfy this equation does not account for the position constraints. Instead, we need to solve for both `theta1` and `theta2` simultaneously, considering both the position and orientation constraints.

---

### Step 3: Simultaneous Solution
To solve for both position and orientation, we can use the following approach:
1. Use the position solution to find `theta1` and `theta2` that position the TCP at the desired location.
2. Adjust the joint angles to match the desired yaw orientation while maintaining the position constraint.

This can be achieved by solving the following system of equations:
```
theta1 + theta2 = r_y
theta1 = alpha - beta
```
where `alpha` and `beta` are derived from the position solution.

### Updated Code
Here’s the updated Python function that implements this approach:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Solve for position
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Adjust for orientation
    # The yaw component of the orientation is the sum of theta1 and theta2
    # So we need to ensure that theta1 + theta2 = r_y
    # We can adjust theta1 and theta2 to achieve this while maintaining the position constraint
    delta = r_y - (theta1 + theta2)
    theta1 += delta / 2
    theta2 += delta / 2
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

---

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Position Solution**: The position solution remains unchanged, as it correctly calculates `theta1` and `theta2` to position the TCP at the desired location.
2. **Orientation Adjustment**: Instead of simply adjusting `theta2`, we distribute the required adjustment (`delta = r_y - (theta1 + theta2)`) equally between `theta1` and `theta2`. This ensures that the position constraint is maintained while matching the desired yaw orientation.

---

### Testing the Solution
To verify the correctness of the solution, you can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the provided test cases. For example:
```
TEST_SOLUTION 0.322780066202141 -0.1197 -0.445564299638089 3.141592653589793 1.504113491087436 3.141592653589793
```

This will test the solution against the first test case and provide feedback on whether the correct joint values are achieved.
