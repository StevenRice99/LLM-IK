To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1, joint2, joint3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details of the manipulator, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. **Calculate joint1**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle for joint1 can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the XZ plane. This is similar to the solution provided in Existing code 1.

2. **Calculate joint2**: This joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle for joint2 can be determined by the distance in the XZ plane and the height (Y-axis) of the target position relative to the base.

3. **Calculate joint3**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle for joint3 can be determined by the position of the TCP relative to the position after joint2.

Let's implement this step by step in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (theta1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane
    d_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (theta2)
    # The target position in the YZ plane after joint1 rotation
    y_target = y - 0.093  # Adjust for TCP offset
    z_target = d_xz - 0.425  # Adjust for link2 offset
    
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    a = 0.39225  # Length of link3
    b = 0.1197   # Length of link2
    c = math.sqrt(y_target**2 + z_target**2)
    
    alpha = math.acos((b**2 + c**2 - a**2) / (2 * b * c))
    beta = math.acos((a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c))
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_target, z_target) - alpha
    
    # Calculate joint3 (theta3)
    theta3 = math.pi - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). The calculations are based on the geometry of the manipulator and the given link lengths and offsets. The function returns the joint angles in radians.
