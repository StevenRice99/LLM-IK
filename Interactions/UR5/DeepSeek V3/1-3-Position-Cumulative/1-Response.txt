To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1, joint2, joint3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details of the manipulator, we can break down the problem into the following steps:

1. **Calculate joint1**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle can be determined by the x and z coordinates of the target position.
2. **Calculate joint2**: This joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle can be determined by the y and z coordinates of the target position, considering the length of the links.
3. **Calculate joint3**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle can be determined by the y and z coordinates of the target position, considering the length of the links and the position of joint2.

Let's implement this step-by-step in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    # Considering the projection of the target position on the YZ plane
    y_proj = y
    z_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2) - L3
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle
    cos_joint2 = (L1**2 + z_proj**2 + y_proj**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * math.sqrt(z_proj**2 + y_proj**2))
    joint2 = math.atan2(y_proj, z_proj) - math.acos(cos_joint2)
    
    # Calculate joint3
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle
    cos_joint3 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - (z_proj**2 + y_proj**2)) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    joint3 = math.acos(cos_joint3) - math.pi / 2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). The calculations are based on the geometry of the manipulator and the lengths of its links. The function returns the joint angles in radians.
