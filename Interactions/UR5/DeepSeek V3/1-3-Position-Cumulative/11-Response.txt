The error indicates that the target position is being flagged as unreachable, even though the instructions specify that we can assume all targets are reachable. This suggests that the reachability check is unnecessary and should be removed.

Let's revise the code to remove the reachability check and ensure that the calculations for `joint2` and `joint3` are correct.

### Revised Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target position onto the YZ plane
    y_proj = y
    z_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2) - L3
    
    # Calculate the distance to the target in the YZ plane
    D = math.sqrt(y_proj**2 + z_proj**2)
    
    # Calculate joint3 using the law of cosines
    cos_joint3 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - D**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_joint3 = max(min(cos_joint3, 1), -1)  # Ensure cos_joint3 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    joint3 = math.acos(cos_joint3)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_proj, y_proj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(joint3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(joint3))
    joint2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

### Explanation

1. **joint1**:
   - Calculated using `math.atan2(x, z)` to determine the angle around the Y-axis.

2. **joint2 and joint3**:
   - The target position is projected onto the YZ plane.
   - The law of cosines is used to calculate `joint3`.
   - `joint2` is then calculated using the angles `alpha` and `beta`.

This revised approach should correctly calculate the joint angles to reach the target positions without unnecessary reachability checks.
