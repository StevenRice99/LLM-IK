The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the target positions. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint values suggest that the approach needs to be revised.

Let's re-examine the problem and derive the correct inverse kinematics solution step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate joint1**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle can be determined by the x and z coordinates of the target position.
   - `joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)`

2. **Calculate joint2**:
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle can be determined by the y and z coordinates of the target position, considering the length of the links.
   - We need to project the target position onto the YZ plane and use the law of cosines to find the angle.

3. **Calculate joint3**:
   - The third joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle can be determined by the y and z coordinates of the target position, considering the length of the links and the position of joint2.

### Revised Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target position onto the YZ plane
    y_proj = y
    z_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2) - L3
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    D = (y_proj**2 + z_proj**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    D = max(min(D, 1), -1)  # Ensure D is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    joint3 = math.acos(D)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_proj, y_proj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(joint3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(joint3))
    joint2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

### Explanation

1. **joint1**:
   - Calculated using `math.atan2(x, z)` to determine the angle around the Y-axis.

2. **joint2 and joint3**:
   - The target position is projected onto the YZ plane.
   - The law of cosines is used to calculate `joint3`.
   - `joint2` is then calculated using the angles `alpha` and `beta`.

This revised approach should correctly calculate the joint angles to reach the target positions.
