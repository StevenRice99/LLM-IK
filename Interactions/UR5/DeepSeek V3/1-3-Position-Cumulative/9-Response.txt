Given the persistent issues with the inverse kinematics calculations, it's clear that a different approach is needed. Let's try a more systematic method to solve the inverse kinematics problem for the 3-DOF manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Calculate joint1**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle can be determined by the x and z coordinates of the target position.
   - `joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)`

2. **Calculate joint2 and joint3**:
   - We need to project the target position onto the YZ plane and use the law of cosines to find the angles.
   - The target position in the YZ plane is given by `y_proj = y` and `z_proj = sqrt(x^2 + z^2) - L3`.
   - Using the law of cosines, we can find the angles for joint2 and joint3.

### Revised Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Project the target position onto the YZ plane
    y_proj = y
    z_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2) - L3
    
    # Calculate the distance to the target in the YZ plane
    D = math.sqrt(y_proj**2 + z_proj**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if D > L1 + L2 or D < abs(L1 - L2):
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    
    # Calculate joint3 using the law of cosines
    cos_joint3 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - D**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_joint3 = max(min(cos_joint3, 1), -1)  # Ensure cos_joint3 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    joint3 = math.acos(cos_joint3)
    
    # Calculate joint2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_proj, y_proj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(joint3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(joint3))
    joint2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

### Explanation

1. **joint1**:
   - Calculated using `math.atan2(x, z)` to determine the angle around the Y-axis.

2. **joint2 and joint3**:
   - The target position is projected onto the YZ plane.
   - The law of cosines is used to calculate `joint3`.
   - `joint2` is then calculated using the angles `alpha` and `beta`.

This revised approach should correctly calculate the joint angles to reach the target positions. The code also includes a check to ensure that the target position is reachable, although the instructions state that we can assume all targets are reachable.
