To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1, joint2, joint3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We have a 3-DOF manipulator with three revolute joints.
   - The positions and orientations of each link are given in the local space relative to their parent link.
   - The TCP position is given by \( p = (x, y, z) \).

2. **Understand the Kinematics:**
   - The forward kinematics of the manipulator can be represented as a series of transformations from the base to the TCP.
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by the joint angles of the three revolute joints.

3. **Use Existing Solutions:**
   - We can use the existing solutions provided in the "EXISTING 1" and "EXISTING 2" sections to help solve for the joint angles.

4. **Solve for Joint 1:**
   - The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We can use the existing solution from "EXISTING 1" to solve for joint1.

5. **Solve for Joint 2 and Joint 3:**
   - The second and third joints (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3) also rotate around the Y-axis.
   - We can use the existing solution from "EXISTING 2" to solve for joint2 and joint3.

6. **Combine the Solutions:**
   - We will combine the solutions from the existing code to form the complete inverse kinematics solution.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint1 using existing solution 1
    joint1 = -math.atan2(-x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint2 and joint3 using existing solution 2
    theta1, theta2 = inverse_kinematics_existing2((x, y, z))
    
    joint2 = theta1
    joint3 = theta2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

### Explanation:

- **joint1**: We use the existing solution from "EXISTING 1" to solve for the first joint angle. This involves calculating the angle using the `atan2` function based on the target position's x and z coordinates.
- **joint2 and joint3**: We use the existing solution from "EXISTING 2" to solve for the second and third joint angles. This involves calculating the angles using the `atan2` function based on the target position's x and z coordinates.

### Note:
- The existing solutions provided are used as a starting point to extend the solution for the entire chain.
- The function assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any reachability checks.

This solution provides a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF serial manipulator.
