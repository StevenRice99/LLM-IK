To address the feedback, it seems that the function `inverse_kinematics` is not recognized or not properly defined in the context where it is being tested. Let's ensure that the function is correctly defined and integrated. 

Given that the existing code provided in EXISTING 1 and EXISTING 2 are helper functions, we need to ensure that the main `inverse_kinematics` function is correctly calling these helper functions and returning the joint angles.

Let's redefine the `inverse_kinematics` function to ensure it is correctly structured and calls the helper functions appropriately.

```python
import math

def calculate_joint1(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint1 value needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set joint1 to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target = p[0]
    z_target = p[2]
    theta = -math.atan2(-x_target, z_target)
    return theta

def calculate_joint2(p: tuple[float, float, float], joint1: float) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint2 value needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param joint1: The value of joint1.
    :return: The value to set joint2 to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the distance in the x-z plane after accounting for joint1
    distance_xz = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    # Calculate the angle for joint2
    theta = math.atan2(y, distance_xz)
    return theta

def calculate_joint3(p: tuple[float, float, float], joint1: float, joint2: float) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint3 value needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param joint1: The value of joint1.
    :param joint2: The value of joint2.
    :return: The value to set joint3 to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Calculate the remaining distance after accounting for joint1 and joint2
    remaining_distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2) - (0.1197 + 0.425 + 0.39225)
    # Calculate the angle for joint3
    theta = math.atan2(remaining_distance, 0.093)
    return theta

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    joint1 = calculate_joint1(p)
    joint2 = calculate_joint2(p, joint1)
    joint3 = calculate_joint3(p, joint1, joint2)
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

This code defines the `inverse_kinematics` function along with the helper functions `calculate_joint1`, `calculate_joint2`, and `calculate_joint3`. The `inverse_kinematics` function calls these helper functions to compute the joint angles and returns them as a tuple.

If the error persists, it might be due to the context in which the function is being tested. Ensure that the function is correctly imported and used in the testing environment.
