The error indicates that the function `inverse_kinematics_existing2` is not defined. This is because the existing solution provided in "EXISTING 2" was not included in the code. Let's correct this by defining the `inverse_kinematics_existing2` function within the `inverse_kinematics` function.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint1 using existing solution 1
    joint1 = -math.atan2(-x, z)
    
    # Define the existing solution 2 within the function
    def inverse_kinematics_existing2(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
        """
        Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
        :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
        :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
        """
        x, y, z = p
        theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
        theta2 = 0.0
        return (theta1, theta2)
    
    # Solve for joint2 and joint3 using existing solution 2
    theta1, theta2 = inverse_kinematics_existing2((x, y, z))
    
    joint2 = theta1
    joint3 = theta2
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

### Explanation:

- **joint1**: We use the existing solution from "EXISTING 1" to solve for the first joint angle. This involves calculating the angle using the `atan2` function based on the target position's x and z coordinates.
- **joint2 and joint3**: We define the `inverse_kinematics_existing2` function within the `inverse_kinematics` function to solve for the second and third joint angles. This involves calculating the angles using the `atan2` function based on the target position's x and z coordinates.

### Note:
- The existing solutions provided are used as a starting point to extend the solution for the entire chain.
- The function assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any reachability checks.

This corrected implementation should resolve the `NameError` and provide a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF serial manipulator.
