The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of `joint2` and `joint3`. Let's re-examine the approach and correct the implementation.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Define the Problem:**
   - We have a 3-DOF manipulator with three revolute joints.
   - The positions and orientations of each link are given in the local space relative to their parent link.
   - The TCP position is given by \( p = (x, y, z) \).

2. **Understand the Kinematics:**
   - The forward kinematics of the manipulator can be represented as a series of transformations from the base to the TCP.
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by the joint angles of the three revolute joints.

3. **Solve for Joint 1:**
   - The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We can use the existing solution from "EXISTING 1" to solve for joint1.

4. **Solve for Joint 2 and Joint 3:**
   - The second and third joints (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3) also rotate around the Y-axis.
   - We need to calculate the angles based on the geometry of the manipulator.

5. **Combine the Solutions:**
   - We will combine the solutions to form the complete inverse kinematics solution.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint1 using existing solution 1
    joint1 = -math.atan2(-x, z)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the x-z plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from joint1 to joint2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from joint2 to joint3
    l3 = 0.093  # Length from joint3 to TCP
    
    # Solve for joint2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for joint3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    joint2 = theta2
    joint3 = theta3
    
    return (joint1, joint2, joint3)
```

### Explanation:

- **joint1**: We use the existing solution from "EXISTING 1" to solve for the first joint angle. This involves calculating the angle using the `atan2` function based on the target position's x and z coordinates.
- **joint2 and joint3**: We calculate the angles using the law of cosines based on the geometry of the manipulator. This involves calculating the distances and using the lengths of the links to determine the angles.

### Note:
- The function assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any reachability checks.
- The lengths of the links are based on the provided details.

This corrected implementation should provide a more accurate solution for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF serial manipulator.
