To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to extend the existing solution for the first two links to include the third link and the TCP. The existing solution calculates the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` for the first two links. We will use this solution and then calculate `theta3` to account for the third link and the TCP.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate `theta1` and `theta2` using the existing solution:**
   - The existing solution calculates `theta1` and `theta2` based on the target position `p = (x, y, z)`.
   - This solution assumes that the third link is the TCP, but in our case, the TCP is offset from the third link.

2. **Adjust the target position for the third link:**
   - The TCP is offset from the third link by `[0, 0.093, 0]`.
   - To find the position of the third link, we need to subtract this offset from the target position `p`.

3. **Calculate `theta3`:**
   - After finding the position of the third link, we can calculate `theta3` based on the orientation of the third link relative to the second link.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust the target position for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    
    # Calculate theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Calculate theta3 based on the orientation of the third link
    # Since the third link is aligned with the second link, theta3 is simply the difference in orientation
    theta3 = 0  # Assuming no additional rotation is needed for the third link
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** We adjust the target position `p` by subtracting the TCP offset `[0, 0.093, 0]` to get the position of the third link.
- **Step 2:** We use the existing solution to calculate `theta1` and `theta2` based on the adjusted position.
- **Step 3:** We assume `theta3` is 0 because the third link is aligned with the second link, and no additional rotation is needed.

This solution provides the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` required to reach the target position `p`.
