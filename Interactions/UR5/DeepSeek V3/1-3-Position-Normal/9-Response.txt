The error occurs because the `^` operator in Python is the **bitwise XOR operator**, not the exponentiation operator. For exponentiation, we should use `**`. Letâ€™s fix this issue and ensure the code is correct.

---

### Step 1: Fixing the Exponentiation Operator
Replace `^` with `**` in the calculation of `cos_theta3`.

---

### Step 2: Updated Python Implementation
Here is the corrected Python implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.1197
    L2 = 0.425
    L3 = 0.39225
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(z, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    y_prime = y - L1
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + y_prime**2)
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (L2**2 + L3**2 - d**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta3, -1, 1))  # Clip to avoid numerical errors
    
    # Step 4: Solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    alpha = np.arctan2(y_prime, r)
    beta = np.arctan2(L3 * np.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Step 3: Explanation of Changes
1. **Fixed the Exponentiation Operator**:
   - Replaced `L3 ^ 2` with `L3 ** 2` and `d ^ 2` with `d ** 2`.
   - This ensures that the correct mathematical operation (exponentiation) is performed.

2. **Numerical Stability**:
   - The `np.clip` function ensures that the argument to `np.arccos` stays within the valid range \([-1, 1]\), avoiding numerical errors.

---

### Step 4: Verification
To verify the solution, we can use the `FORWARD_KINEMATICS` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired target position.

```python
FORWARD_KINEMATICS theta1 theta2 theta3
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space, allowing us to verify the accuracy of the inverse kinematics solution.

---

### Step 5: Key Improvements
1. **Corrected the Exponentiation Operator**: Ensures the correct mathematical operation is performed.
2. **Handled Numerical Stability**: The `np.clip` function prevents invalid inputs to `np.arccos`.
3. **Refined the Calculation of \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)**: Ensures the correct relationship between the angles.

This corrected solution should now work without errors and compute the joint angles to reach the target positions.
