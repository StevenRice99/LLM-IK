To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃) that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. Given that all joints are revolute and rotate around the Y-axis, we can break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Solve for θ₁
The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane is influenced by θ₁. We can use the `inverse_kinematics` function from **Existing 1** to solve for θ₁.

```python
theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
```

### Step 2: Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
After determining θ₁, we can transform the target position `p` into the coordinate frame of the second joint. This involves subtracting the position of the first joint and rotating by -θ₁.

Let’s define the positions of the joints in the local frames:
- Joint 1: [0, 0, 0]
- Joint 2: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
- Joint 3: [0, 0, 0.39225]
- TCP: [0, 0.093, 0]

The position of the TCP in the world frame is given by:
\[
\text{TCP}_{\text{world}} = R_{y}(\theta_1) \cdot (R_{y}(\theta_2) \cdot (R_{y}(\theta_3) \cdot \text{TCP}_{\text{local}} + \text{Joint3}_{\text{local}}) + \text{Joint2}_{\text{local}}) + \text{Joint1}_{\text{local}}
\]

However, since all joints rotate around the Y-axis, the problem simplifies to a planar problem in the X-Z plane.

### Step 3: Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
We can use the law of cosines to solve for θ₂ and θ₃. Let’s define the lengths:
- L₁ = 0.425 (distance from Joint 1 to Joint 2)
- L₂ = 0.39225 (distance from Joint 2 to Joint 3)
- L₃ = 0.093 (distance from Joint 3 to TCP)

The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane after rotating by θ₁ is:
\[
x' = p[0] \cdot \cos(\theta_1) + p[2] \cdot \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z' = -p[0] \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + p[2] \cdot \cos(\theta_1)
\]

Now, we can solve for θ₂ and θ₃ using the law of cosines:
\[
d = \sqrt{x'^2 + (z' - L_1)^2}
\]
\[
\alpha = \text{atan2}(x', z' - L_1)
\]
\[
\beta = \text{acos}\left(\frac{L_2^2 + d^2 - L_3^2}{2 \cdot L_2 \cdot d}\right)
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \alpha - \beta
\]
\[
\gamma = \text{acos}\left(\frac{L_2^2 + L_3^2 - d^2}{2 \cdot L_2 \cdot L_3}\right)
\]
\[
\theta_3 = \pi - \gamma
\]
