The feedback indicates that the current solution is not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions and orientations. The issue likely arises from the way the intermediate calculations are being handled, particularly in the transformation of the target position and the application of the law of cosines.

### Revised Approach
To address this, we need to:
1. **Correctly transform the target position** into the frame of Joint 2.
2. **Ensure the law of cosines is applied correctly** to solve for θ₂ and θ₃.
3. **Account for the orientation** of the TCP, which is influenced by the joint angles.

### Revised Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Transform the target position to the frame of Joint 2
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    z_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Define lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    L3 = 0.093
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + (z_prime - L1)**2)
    
    # Ensure the argument to acos is within [-1, 1]
    arg_beta = (L2**2 + d**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * d)
    arg_beta = max(min(arg_beta, 1), -1)  # Clamp to valid range
    beta = math.acos(arg_beta)
    
    alpha = math.atan2(x_prime, z_prime - L1)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    arg_gamma = (L2**2 + L3**2 - d**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    arg_gamma = max(min(arg_gamma, 1), -1)  # Clamp to valid range
    gamma = math.acos(arg_gamma)
    theta3 = math.pi - gamma
    
    # Adjust theta2 and theta3 based on the orientation
    # The orientation is influenced by the sum of theta2 and theta3
    # Since all joints rotate around the Y-axis, the orientation is simply the sum of the joint angles
    # We need to match the orientation r[1] (Y-axis rotation)
    orientation_sum = theta2 + theta3
    orientation_diff = r[1] - orientation_sum
    theta2 += orientation_diff / 2
    theta3 += orientation_diff / 2
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Orientation Adjustment**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the sum of θ₂ and θ₃. We adjust θ₂ and θ₃ to match the desired orientation `r[1]` (Y-axis rotation).

2. **Clamping the Argument to `math.acos`**:
   - The argument to `math.acos` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to prevent domain errors.

3. **No Changes to the Core Logic**:
   - The core logic for solving θ₁, θ₂, and θ₃ remains the same. The orientation adjustment is added to ensure the TCP reaches the desired orientation.

This revised code should now correctly solve for the joint angles to reach the target positions and orientations.
