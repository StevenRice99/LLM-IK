To solve the inverse kinematics problem for both position and orientation, we need to extend the existing position-only solution to account for the desired orientation. The orientation is given in Roll-Pitch-Yaw (RPY) angles, which we need to map to the joint angles of the manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position Solution**: The existing solution calculates the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` to reach the desired position `(x, y, z)`. The third joint angle `theta3` is set to 0 because the existing solution only considers position.

2. **Orientation Solution**: The orientation is given in RPY angles `(roll, pitch, yaw)`. Since all the revolute joints rotate around the Y-axis, the yaw component of the RPY angles directly corresponds to the sum of the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3`. Therefore, we can use the yaw angle to determine `theta3`.

3. **Calculate `theta3`**: The yaw angle `yaw` is the sum of the joint angles:
   \[
   \text{yaw} = \theta1 + \theta2 + \theta3
   \]
   Solving for `theta3`:
   \[
   \theta3 = \text{yaw} - \theta1 - \theta2
   \]

4. **Return the Joint Angles**: The final joint angles are `(theta1, theta2, theta3)`.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Position solution (from existing code)
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Orientation solution
    theta3 = yaw - theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:

- **Position Solution**: The position solution is taken directly from the existing code, which calculates `theta1` and `theta2` based on the desired position `(x, y, z)`.
  
- **Orientation Solution**: The yaw angle from the RPY orientation is used to calculate `theta3` by subtracting `theta1` and `theta2` from the yaw angle. This ensures that the sum of the joint angles matches the desired yaw orientation.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable, as per the instructions.
