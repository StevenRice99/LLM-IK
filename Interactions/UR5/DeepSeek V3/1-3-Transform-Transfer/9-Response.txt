The feedback indicates that the current solution is still failing to correctly account for the orientation, particularly the pitch component of the RPY angles. The issue arises because the current approach does not properly map the pitch angle to the joint angles, and the joint limits are not being handled correctly. Additionally, the position solution is being affected by the incorrect orientation handling.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Orientation Mapping**: The orientation is given in RPY angles `(roll, pitch, yaw)`. Since all joints rotate around the Y-axis, the yaw angle corresponds to the sum of the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3`. However, the pitch angle must also be considered because it affects the orientation of the TCP.

2. **Pitch Angle**: The pitch angle directly corresponds to the angle between the TCP and the base frame. This angle is influenced by the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the pitch angle is correctly mapped to the joint angles.

3. **Joint Limits**: The joint angles must be within the specified limits `[-6.2831853, 6.2831853]`. If the calculated joint angles fall outside these limits, they need to be adjusted.

4. **Revised Solution**:
   - Calculate `theta1` and `theta2` using the position solution.
   - Use the pitch angle to adjust `theta2` and `theta3`.
   - Use the yaw angle to calculate `theta3` after accounting for the pitch angle.

### Revised Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Position solution (from existing code)
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Orientation solution
    # Adjust theta2 based on the pitch angle
    theta2_adjusted = theta2 + pitch
    
    # Calculate theta3 based on the yaw angle and adjusted theta2
    theta3 = yaw - theta1 - theta2_adjusted
    
    # Ensure joint angles are within limits
    theta1 = (theta1 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    theta2_adjusted = (theta2_adjusted + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    theta3 = (theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2_adjusted, theta3)
```

### Explanation:

- **Position Solution**: The position solution remains unchanged, calculating `theta1` and `theta2` based on the desired position `(x, y, z)`.
  
- **Orientation Solution**: The pitch angle is used to adjust `theta2`, and the yaw angle is used to calculate `theta3` after accounting for the adjusted `theta2`. This ensures that the orientation is correctly mapped to the joint angles.

- **Joint Limits**: The joint angles are adjusted to ensure they fall within the specified limits `[-6.2831853, 6.2831853]`.

This revised solution should correctly handle both the position and orientation of the TCP.
