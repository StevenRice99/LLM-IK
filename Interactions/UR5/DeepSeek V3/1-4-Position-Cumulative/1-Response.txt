To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), \(\theta_3\), and \(\theta_4\) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \(p = (x, y, z)\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for \(\theta_1\):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \(\theta_1\) can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane.
   - \(\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)\)

2. **Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):**
   - The second and third joints also rotate around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from "EXISTING 2" to solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\).
   - Adjust the target position by subtracting the TCP offset in the Y-direction.
   - Use the adjusted position to solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\).

3. **Solve for \(\theta_4\):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle \(\theta_4\) can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the X-Y plane.
   - \(\theta_4 = \text{atan2}(y, x)\)

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the target position for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the existing solution
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = math.atan2(y_adj, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, 0, theta4)
```

### Explanation:
- **\(\theta_1\):** Calculated using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the X-Z plane.
- **\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):** Solved using the existing solution from "EXISTING 2", which involves calculating the angles based on the adjusted target position.
- **\(\theta_4\):** Calculated using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the X-Y plane after adjusting for the TCP offset.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions. The joint angles are returned in radians.
