The feedback indicates that the current implementation fails to reach the target positions correctly. The issue lies in the way \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) are calculated, as well as the handling of the TCP offset and the orientation of the manipulator. Letâ€™s rework the solution step by step to address these issues.

---

### Key Observations from Feedback:
1. **Incorrect \(\theta_1\) Calculation:**
   - The current implementation calculates \(\theta_1\) using `atan2(x, z)`, but this does not account for the manipulator's geometry correctly.

2. **Incorrect \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) Calculation:**
   - The existing solution for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) does not account for the manipulator's link lengths and offsets properly.

3. **Incorrect \(\theta_4\) Calculation:**
   - The current implementation calculates \(\theta_4\) using `atan2(y_adj, x)`, but this does not align with the manipulator's geometry.

4. **TCP Offset Handling:**
   - The TCP offset is not correctly incorporated into the calculations.

---

### Revised Solution:

1. **Solve for \(\theta_1\):**
   - \(\theta_1\) should be calculated based on the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane, considering the manipulator's geometry.

2. **Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):**
   - Use the law of cosines to calculate \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) based on the adjusted target position.

3. **Solve for \(\theta_4\):**
   - \(\theta_4\) should be calculated based on the orientation of the TCP relative to the manipulator's end-effector.

4. **Incorporate TCP Offset:**
   - Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset in the Y-direction.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # TCP offset in the Y-direction
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    D = math.sqrt(d ** 2 + y_adj ** 2)  # Distance in 3D space
    
    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = (D ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Clamp sin_theta3 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    sin_theta3 = math.sin(theta3)
    sin_theta3 = max(min(sin_theta3, 1), -1)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj, d)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * sin_theta3, L1 + L2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = math.atan2(y_adj, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **\(\theta_1\) Calculation:**
   - \(\theta_1\) is calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to align the manipulator with the target position in the X-Z plane.

2. **\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) Calculation:**
   - The law of cosines is used to calculate \(\theta_3\) based on the adjusted target position.
   - \(\theta_2\) is calculated using the angles \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), which account for the manipulator's link lengths and the target position.

3. **\(\theta_4\) Calculation:**
   - \(\theta_4\) is calculated using `atan2(y_adj, x)` to align the TCP with the target position in the X-Y plane.

4. **TCP Offset Handling:**
   - The target position is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset in the Y-direction.

### Testing:
This implementation should now correctly solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator and reach the target positions. If further issues arise, we can refine the calculations further.
