To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to extend the existing solution for the first three links to include the fourth link. The fourth link is a revolute joint with a rotation axis along the Z-axis, and it has an offset of 0.093 meters in the Y-direction. The TCP is offset by 0.09465 meters in the Z-direction from the fourth link.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for the first three joints (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃):**
   - Use the existing solution to solve for the first three joints. This will position the end of the third link at a point that is offset from the target position by the length of the fourth link and the TCP offset.

2. **Adjust the target position for the first three joints:**
   - The target position for the first three joints should be adjusted to account for the offset introduced by the fourth link and the TCP. The fourth link has an offset of 0.093 meters in the Y-direction, and the TCP has an offset of0.09465 meters in the Z-direction.

3. **Solve for the fourth joint (θ₄):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ₄ can be determined by the orientation required to align the TCP with the target position.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust the target position for the first three joints
    # The fourth link has an offset of 0.093 in the Y-direction
    # The TCP has an offset of 0.09465 in the Z-direction
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - 0.093
    z_adj = z - 0.09465
    
    # Solve for the first three joints using the existing solution
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    theta3 = 0
    
    # Solve for the fourth joint (θ₄)
    # The fourth joint rotates around the Z-axis
    # The angle θ₄ is determined by the orientation required to align the TCP with the target position
    theta4 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation:
- **Adjusting the target position:** The target position is adjusted to account for the offsets introduced by the fourth link and the TCP.
- **Solving for the first three joints:** The existing solution is used to solve for the first three joints, positioning the end of the third link at the adjusted target position.
- **Solving for the fourth joint:** The fourth joint is solved by calculating the angle required to align the TCP with the target position in the XY-plane.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions.
