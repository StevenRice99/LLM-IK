To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. The manipulator consists of four revolute joints, with the first three rotating around the Y-axis and the fourth rotating around the Z-axis.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle `theta1` can be determined by projecting the target position onto the X-Z plane and calculating the angle between the projection and the Z-axis.
   - Using the existing code from "EXISTING 1":
     ```python
     theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
     ```

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis. After determining `theta1`, we can calculate the position of the end of the second link relative to the first joint.
   - The position of the end of the second link is given by:
     ```python
     x2 = p[0] - 0.1197 * math.sin(theta1)
     z2 = p[2] - 0.1197 * math.cos(theta1)
     ```
   - The angle `theta2` can then be calculated using the existing code from "EXISTING 2":
     ```python
     theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2)
     ```

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint rotates around the Y-axis. After determining `theta1` and `theta2`, we can calculate the position of the end of the third link relative to the second joint.
   - The position of the end of the third link is given by:
     ```python
     x3 = x2 - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta2)
     z3 = z2 - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta2)
     ```
   - The angle `theta3` can then be calculated using the existing code from "EXISTING 3":
     ```python
     theta3 = math.atan2(x3, z3)
     ```

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle `theta4` is determined by the desired orientation `r` of the TCP.
   - Using the existing code from "EXISTING 4":
     ```python
     theta4 = math.atan2(r[1], r[0])
     ```

### Final Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
    
    # Joint 2
    x2 = p[0] - 0.1197 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = p[2] - 0.1197 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2)
    
    # Joint 3
    x3 = x2 - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta2)
    z3 = z2 - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(x3, z3)
    
    # Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(r[1], r[0])
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This code calculates the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`, and `theta4` required to position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`.
