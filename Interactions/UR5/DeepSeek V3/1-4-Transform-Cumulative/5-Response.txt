The errors indicate that the `math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)` and `math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3 ** 2)` calculations are resulting in negative values, which is not valid for the square root function. This happens when the value of `cos_theta2` or `cos_theta3` is outside the range `[-1, 1]`, which can occur due to numerical inaccuracies or invalid geometric configurations.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the values of `cos_theta2` and `cos_theta3` are clamped to the valid range `[-1, 1]` before calculating the square root. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the target position is unreachable due to the manipulator's geometry.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Clamp `cos_theta2` and `cos_theta3` to the range `[-1, 1]`:**
   - Use the `min` and `max` functions to ensure that the values of `cos_theta2` and `cos_theta3` are within the valid range.

2. **Handle Unreachable Targets:**
   - If the target position is unreachable, the inverse kinematics solution should return `None` or raise an exception. However, since the problem states that all targets are reachable, we can proceed without this check.

### Final Revised Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
    
    # Joint 2
    x2 = p[0] - 0.1197 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = p[2] - 0.1197 * math.cos(theta1)
    d = math.sqrt(x2**2 + z2**2)
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    cos_theta2 = (a**2 + d**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * d)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2), cos_theta2)
    
    # Joint 3
    x3 = x2 - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta2)
    z3 = z2 - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta2)
    d = math.sqrt(x3**2 + z3**2)
    a = 0.39225
    b = 0.093
    cos_theta3 = (a**2 + d**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * d)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2), cos_theta3)
    
    # Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(r[1], r[0])
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Clamping `cos_theta2` and `cos_theta3`:** The `max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)` and `max(min(cos_theta3, 1), -1)` ensure that the values of `cos_theta2` and `cos_theta3` are within the valid range `[-1, 1]`, preventing the `math.sqrt` function from receiving invalid inputs.
- **No Unreachable Target Handling:** Since the problem states that all targets are reachable, we do not need to handle unreachable targets explicitly.

This revised code should now correctly calculate the joint angles without encountering domain errors.
