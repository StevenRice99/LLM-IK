The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is still not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The main issue seems to be that the solution does not account for the full kinematic chain and the transformations between joint frames. Let's revise the approach step by step.

---

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle `theta1` can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane.
   - Using the `inverse_kinematics` function from **EXISTING 1**, we calculate `theta1` as:
     ```python
     theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
     ```

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis. After determining `theta1`, we transform the target position into the coordinate frame of the second joint.
   - The position of the second joint relative to the first joint is `[0, -0.1197, 0.425]`. We subtract this offset from the target position and then calculate `theta2` using the `inverse_kinematics` function from **EXISTING 2`:
     ```python
     p2 = [p[0] - 0, p[1] - (-0.1197), p[2] - 0.425]
     theta2 = math.atan2(p2[0], p2[2])
     ```

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint rotates around the Y-axis. After determining `theta1` and `theta2`, we transform the target position into the coordinate frame of the third joint.
   - The position of the third joint relative to the second joint is `[0, 0, 0.39225]`. We subtract this offset from the target position and then calculate `theta3` using the `inverse_极坐标` function from **EXISTING 3`:
     ```python
     p3 = [p[0] - 0, p[1] - 0, p[2] - 0.39225]
     theta3 = math.atan2(p3[0], p3[2])
     ```

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Z-axis. After determining `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3`, we transform the target orientation into the coordinate frame of the fourth joint.
   - The orientation of the fourth joint relative to the third joint is `[极坐标, 0, 0]`. We calculate `theta4` using the `inverse_kinematics` function from **EXISTING 4`:
     ```python
     theta4 = math.atan2(r[1], r[0])
     ```

---

### Revised Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float极坐标, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
    
    # Joint 2
    p2 = [p[0] - 0, p[1] - (-0.1197), p[2] - 0.425]
    theta2 = math.atan2(p2[0], p2[2])
    
    # Joint 3
    p3 = [p[0] - 0, p[1] - 0, p[2] - 0.39225]
    theta3 = math.atan2(p3[0], p3[2])
    
    # Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(r[1], r[0])
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Joint 1:** The calculation of `theta1` remains the same, as it correctly determines the rotation around the Y-axis.
2. **Joint 2:** The transformation of the target position into the second joint's frame is corrected by subtracting the offset `[0, -0.1197, 0.425]`.
3. **Joint 3:** The transformation of the target position into the third joint's frame is corrected by subtracting the offset `[0, 0, 0.39225]`.
4. **Joint 4:** The calculation of `theta4` remains the same, as it correctly determines the rotation around the Z-axis.

### Next Steps:
If this solution still fails to reach the target, we may need to use the `FORWARD_KINEMATICS` function to verify the transformations between joint frames and ensure the calculations are correct. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with that.
