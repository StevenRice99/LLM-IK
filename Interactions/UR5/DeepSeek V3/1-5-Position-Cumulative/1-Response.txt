To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). We can break this problem down into several steps, leveraging the existing solutions provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for Joint 1 (θ₁):**
   - Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 1** to find θ₁ based on the target position \( p \).
   - The solution is: 
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
     \]

2. **Solve for Joints 2 and 3 (θ₂, θ₃):**
   - Joints 2 and 3 also rotate around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 2** to find θ₂ and θ₃.
   - The solution involves calculating the distance \( d \) from the origin to the target position in the XZ plane, and then using the law of cosines to find θ₂ and θ₃.

3. **Solve for Joint 4 (θ₄):**
   - Joint 4 rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 8** to find θ₄.
   - The solution is:
     \[
     \theta_4 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
     \]

4. **Solve for Joint 5 (θ₅):**
   - Joint 5 rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 10** to find θ₅.
   - The solution is:
     \[
     \theta_5 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
     \]

### Final Inverse Kinematics Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta - theta1
    
    # Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ₅
    theta5 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation:
- **θ₁**: Determines the rotation around the Y-axis to align the manipulator with the target in the XZ plane.
- **θ₂ and θ₃**: These angles are calculated using the law of cosines to position the end effector at the correct distance from the base.
- **θ₄**: This angle rotates around the Z-axis to align the end effector with the target in the XY plane.
- **θ₅**: This final angle ensures the end effector is correctly oriented in the XZ plane.

This function returns the joint angles \( (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4, \theta_5) \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \).
