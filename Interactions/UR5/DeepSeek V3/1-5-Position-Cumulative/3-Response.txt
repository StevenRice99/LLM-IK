The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs when the argument passed to `math.acos` is outside the valid range \([-1, 1]\). This can happen if the target position is unreachable or if there is a miscalculation in the intermediate steps. Since the problem assumes all targets are reachable, the issue likely lies in the calculation of `cos_theta2`.

### Debugging and Fixing the Code:

1. **Check the Calculation of `cos_theta2`:**
   The formula for `cos_theta2` is:
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
   \]
   Here, \(d\) is the distance from the origin to the target in the XZ plane. If \(d\) is too large or too small, `cos_theta2` can fall outside the valid range \([-1, 1]\).

2. **Ensure \(d\) is Within Valid Range:**
   The distance \(d\) must satisfy the triangle inequality:
   \[
   |L_1 - L_2| \leq d \leq L_1 + L_2
   \]
   If \(d\) is outside this range, the target is unreachable, and the calculation of `cos_theta2` will fail.

3. **Add a Check for Valid \(d\):**
   Although the problem assumes all targets are reachable, it’s good practice to ensure \(d\) is within the valid range. If \(d\) is outside the range, we can clamp it to the nearest valid value.

### Updated Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    
    # Ensure d is within valid range
    d_min = abs(L1 - L2)
    d_max = L1 + L2
    if d < d_min:
        d = d_min
    elif d > d_max:
        d = d_max
    
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta - theta1
    
    # Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ₅
    theta5 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Clamping \(d\):**
   - If \(d\) is less than \(d_{\text{min}}\), it is set to \(d_{\text{min}}\).
   - If \(d\) is greater than \(d_{\text{max}}\), it is set to \(d_{\text{max}}\).

2. **Clamping `cos_theta2`:**
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to ensure it is valid for `math.acos`.

This ensures that the calculations remain valid even if the target position is on the boundary of the manipulator's reachable workspace.
