The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles, leading to significant deviations from the target positions. The issue likely stems from incorrect calculations for θ₂, θ₃, and θ₄, as well as the handling of the TCP offset.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of θ₂ and θ₃:**
   - The current implementation does not account for the TCP offset correctly.
   - The calculation of θ₂ and θ₃ needs to consider the position of the TCP relative to the end of the third link.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of θ₄:**
   - The current implementation uses `math.atan2(y, x)` for θ₄, which is incorrect for a Z-axis rotation. Instead, θ₄ should be calculated based on the orientation of the end effector.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of θ₅:**
   - The current implementation uses `math.atan2(x, z)` for θ₅, which is incorrect. θ₅ should be calculated based on the orientation of the end effector.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Solve for θ₁:**
   - Use `math.atan2(x, z)` to align the manipulator with the target in the XZ plane.

2. **Solve for θ₂ and θ₃:**
   - Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset.
   - Use the law of cosines to calculate θ₂ and θ₃.

3. **Solve for θ₄:**
   - Calculate θ₄ based on the orientation of the end effector.

4. **Solve for θ₅:**
   - Calculate θ₅ based on the orientation of the end effector.

### Updated Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.0823
    
    # Solve for θ₁
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust target position for TCP offset
    x_adj = x - tcp_offset * math.cos(theta1)
    z_adj = z - tcp_offset * math.sin(theta1)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ and θ₃
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    
    # Ensure d is within valid range
    d_min = abs(L1 - L2)
    d_max = L1 + L2
    if d < d_min:
        d = d_min
    elif d > d_max:
        d = d_max
    
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta - theta1
    
    # Solve for θ₄
    theta4 = math.atan2(y, math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2))
    
    # Solve for θ₅
    theta5 = 0.0  # Assuming no rotation around the Y-axis for the end effector
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **TCP Offset Adjustment:**
   - The target position is adjusted to account for the TCP offset before solving for θ₂ and θ₃.

2. **Correct Calculation of θ₄:**
   - θ₄ is calculated based on the orientation of the end effector using `math.atan2(y, math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2))`.

3. **Correct Calculation of θ₅:**
   - θ₅ is set to 0.0, assuming no rotation around the Y-axis for the end effector.

This revised implementation should provide more accurate joint angles for reaching the target position.
