To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we can break the problem into two parts: solving for the first three joints (Revolute 1, 2, and 3) and then solving for the last two joints (Revolute 4 and 5). We can use the existing code provided in "EXISTING 1" to solve for the first three joints and then extend the solution to include the last two joints.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for the first three joints (Revolute 1, 2, and 3):**
   - We can use the existing function `inverse_kinematics` from "EXISTING 1" to solve for the first three joints. This function calculates the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` required to position the end of the third link at a given point `p`.

2. **Solve for the last two joints (Revolute 4 and 5):**
   - After solving for the first three joints, we need to calculate the position of the end of the third link in world space. This position will be used as the target for the last two joints.
   - We can then use the existing function `inverse_kinematics` from "EXISTING 2" to solve for the last two joints `theta4` and `theta5`.

3. **Combine the solutions:**
   - The final solution will be a tuple of the five joint angles `(theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)`.

### Explanation:
- **`inverse_kinematics_first_three`**: This function calculates the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` for the first three joints using the provided existing code.
- **`inverse_kinematics_last_two`**: This function calculates the joint angles `theta4` and `theta5` for the last two joints using the provided existing code.
- **`inverse_kinematics`**: This function combines the solutions from the two sub-functions to return the joint angles for all five joints.

This solution assumes that the target position `p` is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions.
