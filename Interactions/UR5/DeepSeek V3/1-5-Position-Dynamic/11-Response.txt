The feedback indicates that the current implementation still fails to reach the target positions accurately. The issue lies in the way the inverse kinematics is being solved, particularly in the calculation of the first three joints (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`) and the last two joints (`theta4`, `theta5`). The current approach does not account for the full kinematic chain and the orientation of the TCP.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `theta3`:**
   - The current implementation sets `theta3 = 0`, which is incorrect. `theta3` should be calculated based on the geometry of the manipulator.

2. **Incorrect Handling of the Last Two Joints:**
   - The function `inverse_kinematics_last_two` assumes a planar configuration and does not account for the 3D orientation of the TCP.

3. **Incorrect Position of the End of the Third Link:**
   - The calculation of the position of the end of the third link (`x3`, `y3`, `z3`) is incorrect because it does not consider the full kinematic chain.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Solve for the First Three Joints (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`):**
   - Use the law of cosines to calculate `theta2` and `theta1` based on the target position.
   - Calculate `theta3` based on the geometry of the manipulator.

2. **Solve for the Last Two Joints (`theta4`, `theta5`):**
   - Use the orientation of the TCP to calculate `theta4` and `theta5`.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`inverse_kinematics_first_three`:**
   - Correctly calculates `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` based on the target position and the geometry of the manipulator.
   - Uses the law of cosines to calculate `theta3` and clamps the value to the valid range `[-1, 1]`.

2. **`inverse_kinematics_last_two`:**
   - Calculates the position of the end of the third link (`x3`, `y3`, `z3`) based on the first three joint angles.
   - Uses the difference between the target position and the end of the third link to calculate `theta4` and `theta5`.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated code with the provided target positions to verify its accuracy.
- If further issues arise, additional debugging may be required to ensure the calculations are correct.
