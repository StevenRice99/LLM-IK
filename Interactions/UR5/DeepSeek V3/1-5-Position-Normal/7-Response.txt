The error indicates a syntax issue in the code, specifically on line 35. Upon reviewing the code, I notice that there is an indentation issue and a missing comment symbol (`#`) for the `Joint 5` section. Let's fix these issues and ensure the code is syntactically correct.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1: Rotate around Y-axis
    theta1 = np.arctan2(z, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane after Joint 1 rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    # Calculate the vertical distance after Joint 1 rotation
    h = y - (-0.1197)
    
    # Link lengths
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from Joint 2 to the target
    c = np.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    
    # Calculate the angles using the law of cosines
    alpha = np.arccos((a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c))
    beta = np.arccos((a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b))
    
    # Joint 2: Rotate around Y-axis
    theta2 = np.arctan2(h, r) - alpha
    
    # Joint 3: Rotate around Y-axis
    theta3 = np.pi - beta
    
    # Joint 4: Rotate around Z-axis
    # The orientation of the TCP is fixed, so theta4 is 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 5: Rotate around Y-axis
    # The orientation of the TCP is fixed, so theta5 is 0
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Indentation:** Ensured all lines are properly indented.
2. **Comment Symbol:** Added the missing `#` symbol for the `Joint 5` section to make it a valid comment.

### Key Points:
- **Joint 1:** Calculates the rotation around the Y-axis using `arctan2(z, x)`.
- **Joint 2 and Joint 3:** Use the law of cosines to compute the angles based on the geometry of the manipulator.
- **Joint 4 and Joint 5:** Set to 0 because the orientation of the TCP is fixed.

This corrected implementation should now be syntactically valid and ready for testing.
