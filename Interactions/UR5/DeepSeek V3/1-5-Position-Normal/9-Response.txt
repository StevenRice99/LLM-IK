The feedback indicates that the current implementation is not correctly calculating the joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issue seems to be in the calculation of \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \), which are resulting in `nan` values or incorrect angles. Let's refine the solution step by step, ensuring that the calculations for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) are accurate.

### Revised Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - **Axis:** Y-axis
   - **Position:** [0, 0, 0]
   - **Orientation:** [0, 0, 0]
   - **Solution:** The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_1 \) can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ plane and calculating the angle between the projection and the X-axis.
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(z, x)
   \]

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - **Axis:** Y-axis
   - **Position:** [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
   - **Orientation:** [0, 0, 0]
   - **Solution:** The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_2 \) can be determined by considering the vertical distance and the horizontal distance after accounting for the first joint's rotation.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - **Axis:** Y-axis
   - **Position:** [0, 0, 0.39225]
   - **Orientation:** [0, 0, 0]
   - **Solution:** The third joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_3 \) is determined by the remaining distance to the target after accounting for the first two joints.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - **Axis:** Z-axis
   - **Position:** [0, 0.093, 0]
   - **Orientation:** [0, 0, 0]
   - **Solution:** The fourth joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle \( \theta_4 \) is determined by the orientation required to align the TCP with the target position.

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - **Axis:** Y-axis
   - **Position:** [0, 0, 0.09465]
   - **Orientation:** [0, 0,0]
   - **Solution:** The fifth joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_5 \) is determined by the final orientation required to position the TCP at the target.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1: Rotate around Y-axis
    theta1 = np.arctan2(z, x)
    
    # Calculate the distance in the XZ plane after Joint 1 rotation
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    # Calculate the vertical distance after Joint 1 rotation
    h = y - (-0.1197)
    
    # Link lengths
    a = 0.425
    b = 0.39225
    
    # Calculate the distance from Joint 2 to the target
    c = np.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)
    
    # Calculate the angles using the law of cosines
    alpha = np.arccos(np.clip((a**2 + c**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * c), -1, 1))
    beta = np.arccos(np.clip((a**2 + b**2 - c**2) / (2 * a * b), -1, 1))
    
    # Joint 2: Rotate around Y-axis
    theta2 = np.arctan2(h, r) - alpha
    
    # Joint 3: Rotate around Y-axis
    theta3 = np.pi - beta
    
    # Joint 4: Rotate around Z-axis
    # The orientation of the TCP is fixed, so theta4 is 0
    theta4 = 0.0
    
    # Joint 5: Rotate around Y-axis
    # The orientation of the TCP is fixed, so theta5 is 0
    theta5 = 0.0
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1:** The angle \( \theta_1 \) is calculated using the `arctan2` function to determine the rotation around the Y-axis.
- **Joint 2:** The angle \( \theta_2 \) is calculated using the law of cosines to determine the rotation around the Y-axis after accounting for the first joint's rotation. The `np.clip` function is used to ensure the argument to `arccos` is within the valid range [-1, 1].
- **Joint 3:** The angle \( \theta_3 \) is calculated using the law of cosines to determine the rotation around the Y-axis after accounting for the first two joints' rotations. The `np.clip` function is used to ensure the argument to `arccos` is within the valid range [-1, 1].
- **Joint 4 and Joint 5:** The angles \( \theta_4 \) and \( \theta_5 \) are set to 0 because the orientation of the TCP is fixed.

This revised solution should now correctly calculate the joint angles for the given target positions.
