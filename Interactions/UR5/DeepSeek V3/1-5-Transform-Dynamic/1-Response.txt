To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position and orient the TCP at the desired target. The manipulator consists of five revolute joints, each with a specific axis of rotation and link lengths. The TCP is the end-effector of the manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane can be used to determine the angle of Joint 1.
   - The angle θ₁ can be calculated using the `atan2` function:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
     \]

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - After determining θ₁, we can transform the target position into the coordinate frame of Joint 2.
   - The angle θ₂ can be calculated based on the transformed position.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - After determining θ₁ and θ₂, we can transform the target position into the coordinate frame of Joint 3.
   - The angle θ₃ can be calculated based on the transformed position.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - After determining θ₁, θ₂, and θ₃, we can transform the target position into the coordinate frame of Joint 4.
   - The angle θ₄ can be calculated based on the transformed position.

5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5):**
   - The fifth joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - After determining θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, and θ₄, we can transform the target position into the coordinate frame of Joint 5.
   - The angle θ₅ can be calculated based on the transformed position.

### Implementation:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Transform target position to Joint 2's frame
    x2 = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    y2 = y - 0.1197
    z2 = -x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1) - 0.425

    # Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2)

    # Transform target position to Joint 3's frame
    x3 = x2 * math.cos(theta2) + z2 * math.sin(theta2)
    y3 = y2
    z3 = -x2 * math.sin(theta2) + z2 * math.cos(theta2) - 0.39225

    # Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(x3, z3)

    # Transform target position to Joint 4's frame
    x4 = x3 * math.cos(theta3) + z3 * math.sin(theta3)
    y4 = y3 - 0.093
    z4 = -x3 * math.sin(theta3) + z3 * math.cos(theta3)

    # Joint 4: Rotates around Z-axis
    theta4 = math.atan2(y4, x4)

    # Transform target position to Joint 5's frame
    x5 = x4 * math.cos(theta4) - y4 * math.sin(theta4)
    y5 = x4 * math.sin(theta4) + y4 * math.cos(theta4)
    z5 = z4 - 0.09465

    # Joint 5: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta5 = math.atan2(x5, z5)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1 (θ₁):** The angle is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
- **Joint 2 (θ₂):** The target position is transformed into the coordinate frame of Joint 2, and the angle is calculated using the `atan2` function.
- **Joint 3 (θ₃):** The target position is transformed into the coordinate frame of Joint 3, and the angle is calculated using the `atan2` function.
- **Joint 4 (θ₄):** The target position is transformed into the coordinate frame of Joint 4, and the angle is calculated using the `atan2` function.
- **Joint 5 (θ₅):** The target position is transformed into the coordinate frame of Joint 5, and the angle is calculated using the `atan2` function.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable, and it provides the joint angles in radians.
