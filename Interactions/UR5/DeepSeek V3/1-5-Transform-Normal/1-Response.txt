To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 5-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. The manipulator consists of five revolute joints, each with a specific axis of rotation and link lengths.

### Step 1: Define the DH Parameters
First, we need to define the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters for the manipulator. The DH parameters are typically defined as:
- `a`: Link length (distance along x-axis)
- `α`: Link twist (rotation around x-axis)
- `d`: Link offset (distance along z-axis)
- `θ`: Joint angle (rotation around z-axis)

Given the link positions and orientations, we can derive the DH parameters as follows:

1. **Revolute 1**:
   - `a`: 0
   - `α`: 0
   - `d`: 0
   - `θ`: θ1 (rotation around Y-axis)

2. **Revolute 2**:
   - `a`: 0
   - `α`: 0
   - `d`: 0.1197
   - `θ`: θ2 (rotation around Y-axis)

3. **Revolute 3**:
   - `a`: 0
   - `α`: 0
   - `d`: 0.39225
   - `θ`: θ3 (rotation around Y-axis)

4. **Revolute 4**:
   - `a`: 0
   - `α`: 0
   - `d`: 0.093
   - `θ`: θ4 (rotation around Z-axis)

5. **Revolute 5**:
   - `a`: 0
   - `α`: 0
   - `d`: 0.09465
   - `θ`: θ5 (rotation around Y-axis)

### Step 2: Compute the Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics can be computed using the DH parameters. The transformation matrix for each link can be computed as:

\[
T_i = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta_i) & -\sin(\theta_i)\cos(\alpha_i) & \sin(\theta_i)\sin(\alpha_i) & a_i\cos(\theta_i) \\
\sin(\theta_i) & \cos(\theta_i)\cos(\alpha_i) & -\cos(\theta_i)\sin(\alpha_i) & a_i\sin(\theta_i) \\
0 & \sin(\alpha_i) & \cos(\alpha_i) & d_i \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The overall transformation matrix from the base to the TCP is the product of all individual transformation matrices:

\[
T_{total} = T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot T_4 \cdot T_5
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles
To solve for the joint angles, we need to equate the transformation matrix `T_total` to the desired position and orientation. This involves solving a system of nonlinear equations, which can be complex. However, given the structure of the manipulator, we can break down the problem into smaller parts.

1. **Solve for θ1**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ1 can be determined by projecting the desired position onto the XY plane and computing the angle between the projection and the X-axis.

2. **Solve for θ2, θ3, θ4**:
   - These joints are responsible for positioning the TCP in 3D space. We can use geometric methods to solve for these angles based on the desired position.

3. **Solve for θ5**:
   - The last joint rotates around the Y-axis and is responsible for the final orientation of the TCP. The angle θ5 can be determined by comparing the desired orientation with the orientation achieved by the first four joints.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution in Python
The inverse kinematics solution can be implemented in Python using the derived equations. Here is the code:

```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, sqrt, acos, pi

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)

    # Solve for θ2, θ3, θ4
    # These angles can be solved using geometric methods based on the desired position
    # For simplicity, we assume a planar manipulator with three links
    l1 = 0.1197
    l2 = 0.39225
    l3 = 0.093
    l4 = 0.09465

    # Compute the position of the end-effector in the plane
    x_plane = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_plane = z - l1

    # Solve for θ2 and θ3 using the law of cosines
    D = (x_plane**2 + z_plane**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = acos(D)

    theta2 = atan2(z_plane, x_plane) - atan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))

    # Solve for θ4
    theta4 = yaw - theta1 - theta2 - theta3

    # Solve for θ5
    theta5 = pitch

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

```
TEST_SOLUTION x y z roll pitch yaw
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution.
