The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is not correctly computing the joint angles to reach the desired positions and orientations. The errors suggest that the geometric approach used in the code is insufficient for this manipulator's structure. To address this, we need to refine the inverse kinematics solution by considering the specific geometry and constraints of the 5-DOF manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Refinement

1. **Revolute Joints and Axes**:
   - Joint 1: Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - Joint 2: Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - Joint 3: Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - Joint 4: Rotates around the Z-axis.
   - Joint 5: Rotates around the Y-axis.

2. **TCP Position and Orientation**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by all five joints.
   - The TCP orientation is primarily influenced by Joints 4 and 5.

3. **Geometric Approach**:
   - Use the position of the TCP to solve for Joints 1, 2, and 3.
   - Use the orientation of the TCP to solve for Joints 4 and 5.

### Updated Inverse Kinematics Solution

Here is the refined inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import numpy as np
from math import atan2, sqrt, acos, pi

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.1197
    l2 = 0.39225
    l3 = 0.093
    l4 = 0.09465
    l5 = 0.0823

    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)

    # Project the target position onto the plane of Joint 2
    x_plane = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_plane = z - l1

    # Solve for θ3 using the law of cosines
    D = (x_plane**2 + z_plane**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    D = np.clip(D, -1, 1)  # Clamp D to the valid range [-1, 1]
    theta3 = acos(D)

    # Solve for θ2
    theta2 = atan2(z_plane, x_plane) - atan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))

    # Solve for θ4
    theta4 = yaw - theta1 - theta2 - theta3

    # Solve for θ5
    theta5 = pitch

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Clamping `D`**:
   - Ensures that the argument to `acos` is within the valid range `[-1, 1]`.

2. **Projection onto the Plane**:
   - Projects the target position onto the plane of Joint 2 to simplify the calculation of `theta2` and `theta3`.

3. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - Uses the desired yaw angle to solve for `theta4`.
   - Uses the desired pitch angle to solve for `theta5`.

### Verification

To verify the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired position and orientation.

```
TEST_SOLUTION x y z roll pitch yaw
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution. If the solution is correct, the TCP should reach the desired position and orientation.
