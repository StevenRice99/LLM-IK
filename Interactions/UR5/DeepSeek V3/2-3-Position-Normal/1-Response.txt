To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 is at the origin with its axis of rotation along the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 is offset along the Z-axis by 0.39225 meters with its axis of rotation also along the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset along the Y-axis by 0.093 meters from the end of Revolute 2.

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.39225 \) meters (length of the first link).
- \( L_2 = 0.093 \) meters (length of the second link).

The position of the TCP can be described by the following equations based on the forward kinematics:
\[
x = (L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = (L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z = L_2 \sin(\theta_2)
\]

To find the inverse kinematics, we need to solve these equations for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

1. From the \( z \) equation, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \):
\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{z}{L_2}\right)
\]

2. Once \( \theta_2 \) is known, we can substitute it into the \( x \) and \( y \) equations to solve for \( \theta_1 \):
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

However, we need to ensure that the position \( p \) is reachable, which is assumed in the problem statement.

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.asin(z / L2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p \).
