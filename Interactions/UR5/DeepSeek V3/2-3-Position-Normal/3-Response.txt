To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the forward kinematics result when both joint angles are set to 0, we can see that the TCP is at position \( [0, 0.093, 0.39225] \). This indicates that the manipulator has a base height of 0.39225 meters and an offset of 0.093 meters in the y-direction.

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.39225 \) meters (length of the first link)
- \( L_2 = 0.093 \) meters (length of the second link)
- \( p = (x, y, z) \) (desired position of the TCP)

The position of the TCP can be expressed in terms of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) as follows:
\[
x = L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
y = L_1 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
z = L_1 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) - L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

To solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we can use the following steps:

1. Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the y and z coordinates:
\[
y = L_1 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
z = L_1 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) - L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

2. Once \( \theta_1 \) is known, solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the x coordinate:
\[
x = L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = np.arcsin(x / L2) - theta1
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p \). The function uses the `arctan2` function to handle the quadrant correctly and the `arcsin` function to solve for \( \theta_2 \).
