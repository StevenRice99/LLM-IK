The error indicates that the value passed to `math.asin` is outside the valid range \([-1, 1]\), which is the domain of the arcsine function. This suggests that the target position \( p \) is not reachable by the manipulator, even though the problem statement assumes that all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable.

To ensure that the value passed to `math.asin` is within the valid range, we can normalize \( z \) by \( L_2 \):

\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{z}{L_2}\right)
\]

However, if \( \frac{z}{L_2} \) is outside the range \([-1, 1]\), it will cause a domain error. To handle this, we can add a check to ensure that \( \frac{z}{L_2} \) is within the valid range:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Ensure z is within the valid range for asin
    if abs(z / L2) > 1:
        raise ValueError("The target position is not reachable.")
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.asin(z / L2)
    
    # Calculate the denominator for theta1
    denominator = L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y / denominator, x / denominator)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function now includes a check to ensure that \( \frac{z}{L_2} \) is within the valid range for the arcsine function. If it's not, it raises a `ValueError` indicating that the target position is not reachable. This should handle the domain error and provide a clear indication if the target position is not reachable.
