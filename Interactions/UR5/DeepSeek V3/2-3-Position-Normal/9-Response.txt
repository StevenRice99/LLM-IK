Given the feedback, it appears that the target positions provided are causing the `ValueError` because the condition \( |\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)| \leq 1 \) is not being met. This suggests that the target positions are indeed out of reach for the given manipulator configuration.

However, the instructions specify that we should assume all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach to ensure that the inverse kinematics function does not raise an error for reachable targets.

Let's re-evaluate the approach and correct the inverse kinematics solution.

### Correct Approach

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis.
   - The first link has a length \( L_1 = 0.39225 \) meters.
   - The second link has a length \( L_2 = 0.093 \) meters.
   - The TCP is offset by \( L_2 \) in the Y-direction.

2. **Formulate the Equations**:
   - The position of the TCP can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     y = L_1 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z = L_1 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) - L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]

3. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - From the x-coordinate equation:
     \[
     \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = \frac{x}{L_2}
     \]
   - From the y and z coordinates, we can derive:
     \[
     y = L_1 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z = L_1 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) - L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
   - We can solve these equations simultaneously to find \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Corrected Code

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, z)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    sin_theta1_plus_theta2 = x / L2
    cos_theta1_plus_theta2 = np.sqrt(1 - sin_theta1_plus_theta2**2)
    theta1_plus_theta2 = np.arctan2(sin_theta1_plus_theta2, cos_theta1_plus_theta2)
    theta2 = theta1_plus_theta2 - theta1
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation

1. **Calculate \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - Using `np.arctan2(y, z)` to get the angle from the y and z coordinates.

2. **Calculate \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - First, compute \( \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = \frac{x}{L_2} \).
   - Then, compute \( \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(\theta_1 + \theta_2)} \).
   - Finally, compute \( \theta_1 + \theta_2 = \arctan2(\sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2), \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)) \) and subtract \( \theta_1 \) to get \( \theta_2 \).

This corrected approach should now correctly compute the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to reach the desired position \( p \) without raising an error for reachable targets.
