To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ₁ and θ₂) that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. 

Given the details:
- **Revolute 1**: Positioned at `[0, 0, 0]` with a rotation axis along `Y`.
- **Revolute 2**: Positioned at `[0, 0, 0.39225]` with a rotation axis along `Y`.
- **TCP**: Positioned at `[0, 0.093, 0]` relative to the last link.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position of TCP in World Coordinates**:
   The TCP position in world coordinates can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{TCP}_{\text{world}} = \text{Revolute1}_{\text{world}} + \text{Revolute2}_{\text{world}} + \text{TCP}_{\text{local}}
   \]
   Where:
   - \(\text{Revolute1}_{\text{world}}\) is the position of Revolute 1 in world coordinates.
   - \(\text{Revolute2}_{\text{world}}\) is the position of Revolute 2 in world coordinates.
   - \(\text{TCP}_{\text{local}}\) is the position of TCP relative to Revolute 2.

2. **Joint Angles Calculation**:
   - **θ₁**: The angle of Revolute 1 can be calculated using the `atan2` function based on the x and z coordinates of the target position.
   - **θ₂**: The angle of Revolute 2 can be calculated similarly, but it needs to account for the offset introduced by Revolute 1.

3. **Implementation**:
   We will use the existing functions to calculate θ₁ and θ₂.

### Python Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate θ₁ using the existing function for Revolute 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of Revolute 2 in world coordinates
    revolute2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    revolute2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the position of TCP relative to Revolute 2
    tcp_x = x - revolute2_x
    tcp_z = z - revolute2_z
    
    # Calculate θ₂ using the existing function for Revolute 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(tcp_x, tcp_z)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **θ₁**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the x and z coordinates of the target position. This gives the angle needed for Revolute 1 to align the manipulator towards the target.
- **θ₂**: This is calculated after adjusting for the position of Revolute 2. The position of Revolute 2 is determined by the angle θ₁ and the length of the link (0.39225). The TCP position relative to Revolute 2 is then used to calculate θ₂.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for joint limits or unreachable positions.
