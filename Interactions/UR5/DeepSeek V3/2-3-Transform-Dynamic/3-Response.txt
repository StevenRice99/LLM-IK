The feedback indicates that the current solution fails to correctly calculate the joint angles θ₁ and θ₂ for the given target positions and orientations. The issue lies in the way θ₂ is calculated. Specifically, the current approach does not account for the orientation of the TCP or the correct geometric relationship between the links.

### Revised Approach:

1. **θ₁ Calculation**:
   - θ₁ is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the x and z coordinates of the target position. This part of the solution is correct.

2. **θ₂ Calculation**:
   - θ₂ needs to account for the orientation of the TCP and the geometric relationship between the links. The current approach only considers the position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2, which is insufficient.

3. **Orientation Consideration**:
   - The orientation of the TCP must be considered when calculating θ₂. This involves using the target orientation `r` to adjust the calculation of θ₂.

### Revised Python Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Calculate θ₁ using the existing function for Revolute 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of Revolute 2 in world coordinates
    revolute2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    revolute2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate the position of TCP relative to Revolute 2
    tcp_x = x - revolute2_x
    tcp_z = z - revolute2_z
    
    # Calculate θ₂ using the target orientation
    theta2 = ry - theta1
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **θ₁**: This is calculated using the `atan2` function based on the x and z coordinates of the target position. This part of the solution remains unchanged.
- **θ₂**: This is calculated by subtracting θ₁ from the target orientation `ry`. This ensures that the orientation of the TCP is correctly accounted for in the calculation of θ₂.

### Testing the Solution:
To verify the correctness of the solution, you can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the provided target positions and orientations. For example:

```python
TEST_SOLUTION 0.23577812417811503 0.093 -0.313478450071212 0 -0.95512450978629 0
```

This will test the solution against the first target position and orientation from the feedback. Repeat this process for all target positions and orientations to ensure the solution works correctly.
