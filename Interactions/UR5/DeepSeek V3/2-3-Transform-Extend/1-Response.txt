To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\) with the desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Manipulator Structure:**
   - **Revolute 1:** Rotates around the Y-axis, with its position at \([0, 0, 0]\).
   - **Revolute 2:** Rotates around the Y-axis, with its position at \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to Revolute 1.
   - **TCP:** Positioned at \([0, 0.093, 0]\) relative to Revolute 2.

2. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - The position of the TCP in world space can be derived by applying the transformations due to the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - We need to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) such that the TCP reaches the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\).

4. **Geometric Approach:**
   - The position of the TCP can be expressed in terms of \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) as follows:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     x &= L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
     z &= L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
     y &= 0.093
     \end{aligned}
     \]
     where \(L_1 = 0.39225\) and \(L_2 = 0.093\).

5. **Solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\):**
   - We can use the geometric approach to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). The solution involves using the atan2 function to find the angles based on the position of the TCP.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    D = (x**2 + z**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the atan2 function
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta2:** We use the law of cosines to find the angle \(\theta_2\) between the two links.
- **theta1:** We use the atan2 function to find the angle \(\theta_1\) based on the position of the TCP and the calculated \(\theta_2\).

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not check for joint limits or singularities.
