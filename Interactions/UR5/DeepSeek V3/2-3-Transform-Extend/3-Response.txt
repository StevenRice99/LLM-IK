The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) to reach the desired TCP position and orientation. The issue lies in the geometric approach used to solve for the joint angles. Specifically, the calculation of \(\theta_2\) using the law of cosines and the subsequent calculation of \(\theta_1\) are not producing the correct results.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Re-examining the Geometry:**
   - The manipulator consists of two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis, with link lengths \(L_1 = 0.39225\) and \(L_2 = 0.093\).
   - The TCP position in the XZ plane can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]

2. **Solving for \(\theta_2\):**
   - The law of cosines can still be used, but we need to ensure that the correct quadrant is chosen for \(\theta_2\). The arccosine function returns values in the range \([0, \pi]\), but \(\theta_2\) can be negative or positive depending on the configuration.

3. **Solving for \(\theta_1\):**
   - After finding \(\theta_2\), \(\theta_1\) can be calculated using the atan2 function, but we need to account for the correct quadrant and the influence of \(\theta_2\).

### Revised Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target position in the XZ plane
    D = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if D > L1 + L2 or D < abs(L1 - L2):
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the atan2 function
    alpha = math.atan2(z, x)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta2:** We use the law of cosines to find the angle \(\theta_2\) between the two links. The arccosine function ensures that \(\theta_2\) is in the correct range.
- **theta1:** We use the atan2 function to find the angle \(\theta_1\) based on the position of the TCP and the calculated \(\theta_2\). The angle \(\alpha\) is the angle from the origin to the target position, and \(\beta\) is the angle from the first link to the line connecting the two links.

This revised solution should correctly calculate the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) to reach the desired TCP position and orientation.
