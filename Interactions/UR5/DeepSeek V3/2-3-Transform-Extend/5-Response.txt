The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is still not correctly calculating the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) to reach the desired TCP position and orientation. The issue lies in the handling of the orientation and the quadrant selection for \(\theta_2\). Specifically, the current solution does not account for the orientation of the TCP, and the calculation of \(\theta_2\) is not considering all possible configurations.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Re-examining the Geometry:**
   - The manipulator consists of two revolute joints rotating around the Y-axis, with link lengths \(L_1 = 0.39225\) and \(L_2 = 0.093\).
   - The TCP position in the XZ plane can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]

2. **Solving for \(\theta_2\):**
   - The law of cosines can be used to find \(\theta_2\), but we need to consider both positive and negative solutions for \(\theta_2\) to account for different configurations.

3. **Solving for \(\theta_1\):**
   - After finding \(\theta_2\), \(\theta_1\) can be calculated using the atan2 function, but we need to account for the correct quadrant and the influence of \(\theta_2\).

4. **Orientation Consideration:**
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles \(\theta_1 + \theta_2\). We need to ensure that the calculated joint angles result in the desired orientation.

### Revised Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target position in the XZ plane
    D = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if D > L1 + L2 or D < abs(L1 - L2):
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable")
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Consider both positive and negative solutions for theta2
    theta2_options = [theta2, -theta2]
    
    # Calculate theta1 for each theta2 option
    theta1_options = []
    for theta2_option in theta2_options:
        alpha = math.atan2(z, x)
        beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2_option), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2_option))
        theta1_option = alpha - beta
        theta1_options.append(theta1_option)
    
    # Choose the solution that matches the desired orientation
    desired_orientation = r[1]  # Orientation around the Y-axis
    best_solution = None
    min_error = float('inf')
    
    for theta1, theta2 in zip(theta1_options, theta2_options):
        current_orientation = theta1 + theta2
        error = abs(current_orientation - desired_orientation)
        if error < min_error:
            min_error = error
            best_solution = (theta1, theta2)
    
    return best_solution
```

### Explanation:
- **theta2:** We use the law of cosines to find the angle \(\theta_2\) between the two links. We consider both positive and negative solutions for \(\theta_2\) to account for different configurations.
- **theta1:** We use the atan2 function to find the angle \(\theta_1\) based on the position of the TCP and the calculated \(\theta_2\). We calculate \(\theta_1\) for both \(\theta_2\) options.
- **Orientation Consideration:** We choose the solution that results in the orientation closest to the desired orientation.

This revised solution should correctly calculate the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) to reach the desired TCP position and orientation.
