To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\) with the desired orientation \(r = [\phi, \theta, \psi]\).

### Step 1: Understand the Kinematics
The manipulator consists of two revolute joints, both rotating around the Y-axis. The first joint is at the origin, and the second joint is offset along the Z-axis by 0.39225 meters. The TCP is offset along the Y-axis by 0.093 meters from the second joint.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be derived using the forward kinematics equations. The position of the TCP is given by:

\[
\begin{aligned}
x &= L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
y &= 0.093 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \\
z &= L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\end{aligned}
\]

Where:
- \(L_1 = 0\) (since the first joint is at the origin)
- \(L_2 = 0.39225\) (the length of the second link)

### Step 3: Solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\)
Given the target position \(p = [x, y, z]\), we can solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

1. **Solve for \(\theta_2\):**
   The distance from the origin to the TCP is given by:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
   \]
   Using the law of cosines in the triangle formed by the two links:
   \[
   d^2 = L_1^2 + L_2^2 - 2 L_1 L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
   \]
   Since \(L_1 = 0\), this simplifies to:
   \[
   d = L_2
   \]
   Therefore, \(\theta_2\) can be found using:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{-2 L_1 L_2}\right)
   \]
   However, since \(L_1 = 0\), this approach doesn't work directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the TCP is directly influenced by \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

2. **Solve for \(\theta_1\):**
   The angle \(\theta_1\) can be found using the arctangent of the target position:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
   \]

3. **Solve for \(\theta_2\):**
   Once \(\theta_1\) is known, \(\theta_2\) can be found using the orientation of the TCP. Since the orientation is given by \(r = [\phi, \theta, \psi]\), and both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the orientation of the TCP is directly influenced by \(\theta_1 + \theta_2\). Therefore:
   \[
   \theta_1 + \theta_2 = \theta
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \theta - \theta_1
   \]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
The inverse kinematics solution can be implemented as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    phi, theta, psi = r
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = theta - theta1
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, you can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position and orientation to ensure that the calculated joint angles correctly position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.
