To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to consider the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the joint angles of the two revolute joints. Since both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the orientation of the TCP will be a combination of the rotations from both joints.

Given that the orientation is represented in RPY (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) angles, and both joints rotate around the Y-axis, the orientation of the TCP will primarily be influenced by the Yaw component (the third element in the RPY vector). The Yaw component of the TCP's orientation will be the sum of the joint angles of the two revolute joints.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Position Solution**: We can use the existing `inverse_kinematics` function to solve for the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location. This function calculates the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` based on the target position `p`.

2. **Orientation Solution**: The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2`. The target orientation `r` is given in RPY format, and we are interested in the Yaw component (the third element in the RPY vector). Therefore, we need to ensure that the sum of `theta1` and `theta2` matches the desired Yaw angle.

3. **Adjusting for Orientation**: If the sum of `theta1` and `theta2` does not match the desired Yaw angle, we need to adjust the joint angles to achieve the correct orientation. This can be done by adding an offset to one of the joint angles.

Here is the completed `inverse_kinematics` function that solves for both position and orientation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    desired_yaw = r[2]  # The Yaw component of the orientation
    
    # Solve for the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Calculate the current Yaw based on the joint angles
    current_yaw = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Adjust the joint angles to match the desired Yaw
    yaw_difference = desired_yaw - current_yaw
    theta2 += yaw_difference
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position Solution**: The function first calculates the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` using the existing `inverse_kinematics` logic to position the TCP at the desired location `p`.

2. **Orientation Solution**: The function then calculates the current Yaw angle based on the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`.

3. **Adjusting for Orientation**: The function calculates the difference between the desired Yaw angle and the current Yaw angle. This difference is added to `theta2` to adjust the joint angles so that the TCP's orientation matches the desired orientation.

This solution ensures that the TCP reaches both the desired position and orientation.
