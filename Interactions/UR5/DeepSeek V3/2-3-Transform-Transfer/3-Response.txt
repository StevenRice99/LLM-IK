The feedback indicates that the current implementation fails to correctly account for the orientation of the TCP. Specifically, the orientation of the TCP is not being properly adjusted based on the desired Yaw angle. The issue lies in how the joint angles are being adjusted to match the desired orientation.

### Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Orientation Mismatch**: The current implementation assumes that the Yaw component of the TCP's orientation is simply the sum of the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2`. However, this is not always the case because the orientation of the TCP is influenced by the cumulative rotation of both joints.

2. **Incorrect Adjustment**: The current implementation adjusts `theta2` by the difference between the desired Yaw and the current Yaw. This approach does not account for the fact that the orientation of the TCP is a function of both joint angles, and adjusting only `theta2` can lead to incorrect results.

### Revised Solution:
To correctly solve for both position and orientation, we need to consider the cumulative effect of both joint angles on the TCP's orientation. The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the sum of these angles matches the desired Yaw angle.

Here is the revised `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    desired_yaw = r[2]  # The Yaw component of the orientation
    
    # Solve for the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Calculate the current Yaw based on the joint angles
    current_yaw = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Adjust the joint angles to match the desired Yaw
    yaw_difference = desired_yaw - current_yaw
    theta1 += yaw_difference / 2
    theta2 += yaw_difference / 2
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position Solution**: The function first calculates the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` using the existing `inverse_kinematics` logic to position the TCP at the desired location `p`.

2. **Orientation Solution**: The function then calculates the current Yaw angle based on the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`.

3. **Adjusting for Orientation**: The function calculates the difference between the desired Yaw angle and the current Yaw angle. This difference is evenly distributed between `theta1` and `theta2` to adjust the joint angles so that the TCP's orientation matches the desired orientation.

### Key Changes:
- **Even Distribution of Yaw Difference**: Instead of adjusting only `theta2`, the Yaw difference is evenly distributed between `theta1` and `theta2`. This ensures that the cumulative effect of both joint angles correctly matches the desired Yaw angle.

This revised solution should correctly solve for both the position and orientation of the TCP.
