The feedback indicates that the current implementation still fails to correctly solve for both position and orientation. The issue lies in how the joint angles are being adjusted to match the desired orientation. Specifically, the adjustment of `theta2` to match the desired Yaw angle is not correctly accounting for the cumulative effect of both joint angles on the TCP's orientation.

### Revised Approach:
To correctly solve for both position and orientation, we need to ensure that the sum of the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` matches the desired Yaw angle. However, the current implementation directly adjusts `theta2` to match the desired Yaw angle, which is not always correct. Instead, we need to adjust `theta2` based on the difference between the desired Yaw angle and the current Yaw angle, while keeping `theta1` fixed to maintain the correct position.

Here is the revised `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    desired_yaw = r[2]  # The Yaw component of the orientation
    
    # Solve for the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired location
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Calculate the current Yaw based on the joint angles
    current_yaw = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Adjust theta2 to match the desired Yaw angle
    theta2 += desired_yaw - current_yaw
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position Solution**: The function first calculates the joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` using the existing `inverse_kinematics` logic to position the TCP at the desired location `p`.

2. **Orientation Solution**: The function then calculates the current Yaw angle based on the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`.

3. **Adjusting for Orientation**: The function adjusts `theta2` by the difference between the desired Yaw angle and the current Yaw angle. This ensures that the cumulative effect of both joint angles correctly matches the desired orientation.

### Key Changes:
- **Direct Adjustment of `theta2`**: Instead of directly setting `theta2` to the difference between the desired Yaw angle and `theta1`, the function adjusts `theta2` by the difference between the desired Yaw angle and the current Yaw angle. This ensures that the cumulative effect of both joint angles correctly matches the desired orientation.

### Testing the Solution:
To verify the correctness of the solution, you can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with various target positions and orientations. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION 0.23577812417811503 0.093 -0.313478450071212 0 -0.95512450978629 0
```

This will test the solution with the target position `[0.23577812417811503, 0.093, -0.313478450071212]` and orientation `[0, -0.95512450978629, 0]`.

### Conclusion:
This revised solution should correctly solve for both the position and orientation of the TCP by adjusting `theta2` based on the difference between the desired Yaw angle and the current Yaw angle, while keeping `theta1` fixed to maintain the correct position.
