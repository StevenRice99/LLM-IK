The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics solver is not correctly calculating the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) to reach the target positions. The main issue appears to be in the calculation of \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\), particularly in how the contributions of the links are adjusted and how the angles are computed.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Solve for \(\theta_1\):**
   - The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \(\theta_1\) can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ plane and calculating the angle between the projection and the Z-axis.
   - \(\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)\)

2. **Solve for \(\theta_2\):**
   - The second joint (Revolute 2) also rotates around the Y-axis. After determining \(\theta_1\), we can adjust the target position by subtracting the contribution of the first link.
   - The adjusted position is:
     \[
     \text{adjusted\_x} = x - 0.39225 \cdot \sin(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{adjusted\_z} = z - 0.39225 \cdot \cos(\theta_1)
     \]
   - The total angle \(\theta_{\text{total}}\) is then calculated as:
     \[
     \theta_{\text{total}} = \text{atan2}(\text{adjusted\_x}, \text{adjusted\_z})
     \]
   - Finally, \(\theta_2\) is:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \theta_{\text{total}} - \theta_1
     \]

3. **Solve for \(\theta_3\):**
   - The third joint (Revolute 3) rotates around the Z-axis. After determining \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\), we can adjust the target position by subtracting the contribution of the first two links.
   - The adjusted position is:
     \[
     \text{adjusted\_x} = x - 0.39225 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) - 0.093 \cdot \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     \text{adjusted\_y} = y
     \]
     \[
     \text{adjusted\_z} = z - 0.39225 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) - 0.093 \cdot \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
   - The angle \(\theta_3\) is then calculated as:
     \[
     \theta_3 = \text{atan2}(\text{adjusted\_y}, \text{adjusted\_x})
     \]

### Revised Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Solve for theta3
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1) - 0.093 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    adjusted_y = y
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1) - 0.093 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, adjusted_x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- The calculation of \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) has been adjusted to correctly account for the contributions of the links.
- The adjusted positions are computed by subtracting the contributions of the links from the target position.
- The angles are calculated using the `atan2` function to ensure the correct quadrant is used.

This revised implementation should correctly calculate the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) to reach the target position \(p = (x, y, z)\).
