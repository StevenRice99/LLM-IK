Given the feedback, it's clear that the current approach to calculating θ2 and θ3 is still not accurate. Let's re-examine the problem and adjust the calculations accordingly.

### Step 1: Re-examining the Approach
1. **Joint 1 (θ1)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ1 can be calculated using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
2. **Joint 2 (θ2)**: This joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ2 can be calculated based on the geometry of the manipulator and the transformed coordinates.
3. **Joint 3 (θ3)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ3 can be calculated based on the transformed coordinates after accounting for the rotations of θ1 and θ2.

### Step 2: Correcting the Calculations
We need to correctly calculate θ2 and θ3 by considering the geometry of the manipulator and the transformations due to θ1.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    A = 0.093
    B = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position in the plane after rotating by theta1
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = y
    z_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    D = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + y_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    cos_theta2 = (A**2 + D**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * D)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3 using the arctangent of the transformed coordinates
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_prime, x_prime)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
1. **θ1 Calculation**: We calculate θ1 using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates.
2. **Transformation**: We transform the target position to a new coordinate system after rotating by θ1.
3. **θ2 Calculation**: We use the law of cosines to calculate θ2 based on the transformed coordinates and the lengths of the links.
4. **θ3 Calculation**: We calculate θ3 using the arctangent of the transformed Y and X coordinates.

This approach should provide a more accurate calculation of the joint angles to reach the desired positions.
