Given the feedback, it's clear that the previous approach to solving the inverse kinematics was still incorrect. The main issue lies in the way θ2 and θ3 were calculated. The law of cosines approach does not account for the correct geometric relationships between the joints and the end effector position.

To correct this, we need to use a more accurate method to solve for θ2 and θ3. This involves considering the positions of the links and the desired position of the end effector in a more detailed manner. Let's rework the solution:

### Corrected Solution

1. **Solve for θ1**: This remains the same as before, using the `atan2` function to determine the angle in the X-Z plane.
2. **Solve for θ2 and θ3**: We need to use the correct geometric relationships to solve for these angles. This involves using the positions of the links and the desired position of the end effector.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the correct geometric relationships
    A = 0.093  # Length of link 2
    B = 0.09465  # Length of link 3
    C = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance from the base to the end effector in the X-Z plane
    
    # Using the law of cosines to solve for theta2
    cos_theta2 = (A**2 + C**2 - B**2) / (2 * A * C)
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Using the law of cosines to solve for theta3
    cos_theta3 = (A**2 + B**2 - C**2) / (2 * A * B)
    cos_theta3 = max(min(cos_theta3, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ1**: Calculated using `atan2(x, z)` to determine the angle in the X-Z plane.
2. **θ2 and θ3**: Calculated using the law of cosines. The distances A, B, and C are used to form a triangle, and the angles are derived from the sides of this triangle.

This approach ensures that the geometric constraints are properly considered, leading to the correct joint angles for reaching the desired end effector position.
