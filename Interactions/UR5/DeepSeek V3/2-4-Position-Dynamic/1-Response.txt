To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that will position the TCP at the desired location (x, y, z). We can use the existing solutions as a starting point and extend them to solve for the entire chain.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Solve for θ3 (Joint 3):**
   - The third joint is a revolute joint with its axis along the Z-axis.
   - We can use the existing code 1 to solve for θ3.

2. **Solve for θ2 (Joint 2):**
   - The second joint is a revolute joint with its axis along the Y-axis.
   - We can use the existing code 2 to solve for θ2.

3. **Solve for θ1 (Joint 1):**
   - The first joint is a revolute joint with its axis along the Y-axis.
   - We can use the existing code 2 to solve for θ1.

### Implementation

We will first call the existing code 1 to solve for θ3, then use the existing code 2 to solve for θ2 and θ1.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ3 using existing code 1
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ2 and θ1 using existing code 2
    A = 0.093
    B = 0.09465
    cosθ2 = y / A
    sinθ2 = math.sqrt(1 - cosθ2 ** 2)
    M = [[-A * sinθ2, B], [B, A * sinθ2]]
    det_M = -A * sinθ2 * (A * sinθ2) - B * B
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * (A * sinθ2), -inv_det_M * B], [-inv_det_M * B, inv_det_M * (-A * sinθ2)]]
    cosθ1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z
    sinθ1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)
    theta2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ3 Calculation:**
   - We use `math.atan2(x, z)` to calculate the angle θ3, which is the angle between the X-axis and the projection of the TCP position on the XZ plane.

2. **θ2 and θ1 Calculation:**
   - We use the existing code 2 to solve for θ2 and θ1. This involves setting up a matrix equation and solving for the angles using the inverse of the matrix.

3. **Return Values:**
   - The function returns the calculated angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) which are the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired location.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions.
