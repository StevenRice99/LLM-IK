The feedback indicates that the initial solution provided does not correctly solve the inverse kinematics problem for the given 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint values suggest that the approach needs to be revised.

### Revised Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The manipulator has three revolute joints: Joint 1 (Y-axis), Joint 2 (Y-axis), and Joint 3 (Z-axis).
   - The goal is to find the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that position the TCP at the desired (x, y, z) location.

2. **Re-evaluating the Existing Solutions:**
   - The existing code 1 solves for θ3 using `math.atan2(x, z)`, which is correct for a single joint but may not account for the entire chain.
   - The existing code 2 solves for θ1 and θ2 using a matrix approach, but it seems to be missing the correct transformation for the entire chain.

3. **Correcting the Approach:**
   - We need to consider the entire chain and the transformations between each joint.
   - The forward kinematics should be used to verify the correctness of the inverse kinematics solution.

### Revised Solution

We will use the forward kinematics to verify the correctness of the inverse kinematics solution. Let's start by defining the forward kinematics function and then use it to verify the inverse kinematics.

```python
import math

def forward_kinematics(theta1: float, theta2: float, theta3: float) -> tuple[float, float, float]:

    :param theta1: Joint 1 angle in radians.
    :param theta2: Joint 2 angle in radians.
    :param theta3: Joint 3 angle in radians.
    :return: The TCP position in the form [x, y, z].

### Explanation

1. **Forward Kinematics:**
   - The `forward_kinematics` function computes the TCP position given the joint angles using transformation matrices.

2. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - The `inverse_kinematics` function calculates the joint angles needed to reach the desired TCP position.
   - θ3 is calculated using `math.atan2(x, z)`.
   - θ2 is calculated using the geometric approach.
   - θ1 is calculated using the geometric approach.

3. **Verification:**
   - The forward kinematics function can be used to verify the correctness of the inverse kinematics solution by comparing the computed TCP position with the desired position.

This revised approach should provide a more accurate solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
