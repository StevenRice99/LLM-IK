The error indicates that the value of `D` is causing a domain error in the `math.sqrt` function. This typically happens when the argument to `math.sqrt` is negative, which is not allowed. Let's re-examine the calculation of `D` and ensure that it remains within the valid range.

### Revised Approach

1. **Understanding the Issue:**
   - The value of `D` is calculated as `(x**2 + y**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)`.
   - If `x**2 + y**2` is less than `L1**2 + L2**2`, `D` will be negative, leading to a negative argument for `math.sqrt`.

2. **Ensuring Valid Range for `D`:**
   - We need to ensure that `x**2 + y**2` is greater than or equal to `L1**2 + L2**2` for `D` to be valid.
   - If `x**2 + y**2` is less than `L1**2 + L2**2`, the target position is unreachable, and we should handle this case appropriately.

3. **Implementing a Safe Calculation:**
   - We will add a check to ensure that `x**2 + y**2` is within the valid range before proceeding with the calculation of `D`.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    L3 = 0.09465
    
    # Check if the target position is reachable
    distance_squared = x**2 + y**2
    min_distance_squared = (L1 - L2)**2
    max_distance_squared = (L1 + L2)**2
    
    if not (min_distance_squared <= distance_squared <= max_distance_squared):
        raise ValueError('Target position is not reachable.')
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    D = (distance_squared - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - L1 * math.sin(theta1) - L2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2),
                        x - L1 * math.cos(theta1) - L2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)) - theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Reachability Check:**
   - We calculate the squared distance of the target position from the origin.
   - We check if this distance is within the range defined by the link lengths `L1` and `L2`.
   - If the target position is not reachable, we raise a `ValueError`.

2. **Valid Calculation of `D`:**
   - We ensure that `D` is calculated only if the target position is reachable.
   - This prevents the `math.sqrt` function from receiving a negative argument.

3. **Accurate Joint Angles:**
   - We calculate `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` using the corrected approach, ensuring that the joint angles position the TCP at the desired location.

### Final Answer

The revised `inverse_kinematics` function now includes a reachability check and ensures that the calculation of `D` is valid. This should prevent the `ValueError` and accurately compute the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired location.
