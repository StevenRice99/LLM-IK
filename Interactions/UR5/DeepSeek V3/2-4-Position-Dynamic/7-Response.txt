The error indicates that the target position is being deemed unreachable by the reachability check in the `inverse_kinematics` function. This suggests that the reachability condition might be too restrictive or incorrectly implemented. Let's re-examine the reachability check and ensure it accurately reflects the manipulator's workspace.

### Revised Approach

1. **Understanding the Workspace:**
   - The manipulator has three revolute joints with specific link lengths.
   - The workspace is determined by the combined lengths of the links and the joint limits.

2. **Re-evaluating the Reachability Check:**
   - The previous reachability check used the squared distances and compared them to the sum and difference of the link lengths squared.
   - This approach might be too restrictive, especially for positions that are reachable but close to the boundaries.

3. **Implementing a More Accurate Reachability Check:**
   - We will use the actual distances and ensure that the target position lies within the manipulator's reachable workspace.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    L3 = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target position
    distance = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Check if the target position is within the reachable workspace
    if not (abs(L1 - L2) <= distance <= (L1 + L2)):
        raise ValueError('Target position is not reachable.')
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    D = (x**2 + y**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y - L1 * math.sin(theta1) - L2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2),
                        x - L1 * math.cos(theta1) - L2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)) - theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **Reachability Check:**
   - We calculate the Euclidean distance from the origin to the target position.
   - We check if this distance lies within the range defined by the sum and difference of the link lengths `L1` and `L2`.
   - This ensures that the target position is within the manipulator's reachable workspace.

2. **Accurate Joint Angles:**
   - We calculate `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` using the corrected approach, ensuring that the joint angles position the TCP at the desired location.

### Final Answer

The revised `inverse_kinematics` function now includes a more accurate reachability check and ensures that the target position is within the manipulator's workspace. This should prevent the `ValueError` and accurately compute the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired location.
