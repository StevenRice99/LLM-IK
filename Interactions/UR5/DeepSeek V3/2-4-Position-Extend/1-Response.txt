To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to extend the existing solution to include the third joint. The existing solution provides the joint angles for the first two joints (theta1 and theta2) based on the target position. We need to calculate the third joint angle (theta3) to reach the target position.

Given the details, the third joint is a revolute joint with its axis along the Z-axis. The position of the third joint relative to the second joint is [0, 0.093, 0], and the TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the third joint.

Here's the step-by-step approach to solve the inverse kinematics:

1. **Calculate theta1**: This is the angle of the first joint, which can be calculated using the `atan2` function as in the existing solution.
2. **Calculate theta2**: This is the angle of the second joint. We need to consider the position of the second joint and the target position to calculate this angle.
3. **Calculate theta3**: This is the angle of the third joint. We need to consider the position of the third joint and the target position to calculate this angle.

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # Considering the position of the second joint and the target position
    # We need to solve for theta2 such that the third joint reaches the target position
    # This involves solving a geometric problem considering the lengths of the links and the target position
    # For simplicity, we assume that the target position is reachable and calculate theta2 accordingly
    # This is a simplified approach and may need to be adjusted based on the actual geometry
    theta2 = math.atan2(y - 0.093, z - 0.39225)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # Considering the position of the third joint and the target position
    # We need to solve for theta3 such that the TCP reaches the target position
    # This involves solving a geometric problem considering the lengths of the links and the target position
    # For simplicity, we assume that the target position is reachable and calculate theta3 accordingly
    # This is a simplified approach and may need to be adjusted based on the actual geometry
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles needed to reach the target position `p`. The angles are calculated based on the geometry of the manipulator and the target position. The function assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions.
