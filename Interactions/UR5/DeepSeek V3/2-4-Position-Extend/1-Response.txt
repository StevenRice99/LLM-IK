To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we need to extend the existing solution for the first two links to include the third link. The third link introduces a rotation around the Z-axis, which affects the position of the TCP (Tool Center Point).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for the first two joints (θ1 and θ2):**
   - The existing solution calculates θ1 and θ2 based on the target position `p = (x, y, z)`.
   - The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (Revolute 2) also rotates around the Y-axis.

2. **Adjust the target position for the third joint:**
   - The third joint (Revolute 3) rotates around the Z-axis, which affects the position of the TCP.
   - The TCP is offset from the third joint by `[0, 0, 0.09465]` in the local frame of the third link.

3. **Calculate the third joint angle (θ3):**
   - After solving for θ1 and θ2, we need to determine the angle θ3 that aligns the TCP with the target position.
   - The third joint's rotation around the Z-axis will affect the x and y coordinates of the TCP.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Calculate the position of the third joint after applying theta1 and theta2
    joint3_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1) + 0.093 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    joint3_y = 0.093 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    joint3_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1) + 0.093 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Calculate the vector from the third joint to the target position
    dx = x - joint3_x
    dy = y - joint3_y
    dz = z - joint3_z
    
    # Solve for theta3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta3 = math.atan2(dy, dx)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:

- **θ1 and θ2:** These are calculated using the existing solution, which adjusts the target position based on the lengths of the first two links.
- **θ3:** This is calculated by determining the angle needed to align the TCP with the target position after accounting for the positions of the first two joints. The angle is derived from the vector from the third joint to the target position.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include any checks for unreachable positions. The function returns the joint angles in radians.
