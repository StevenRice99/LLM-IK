The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly solving for the joint angles, particularly for the third joint (θ3). The issue seems to stem from the way θ3 is calculated, as it does not align the TCP with the target position in many cases. Let's revise the approach to correctly solve for θ3.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Solve for θ1 and θ2:**
   - The existing solution for θ1 and θ2 is correct and can be reused.

2. **Calculate the position of the third joint:**
   - After solving for θ1 and θ2, calculate the position of the third joint in world coordinates.

3. **Solve for θ3:**
   - The third joint rotates around the Z-axis, which affects the x and y coordinates of the TCP.
   - The TCP is offset from the third joint by `[0, 0, 0.09465]` in the local frame of the third link.
   - To solve for θ3, we need to align the TCP with the target position by rotating around the Z-axis.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the existing solution
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Calculate the position of the third joint after applying theta1 and theta2
    joint3_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1) + 0.093 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    joint3_y = 0.093 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    joint3_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1) + 0.093 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Calculate the vector from the third joint to the target position
    dx = x - joint3_x
    dy = y - joint3_y
    dz = z - joint3_z
    
    # Solve for theta3 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0, 0.09465] in the local frame of the third link
    # We need to align the TCP with the target position by rotating around the Z-axis
    # The angle theta3 is the angle between the vector [dx, dy] and the local x-axis of the third link
    # The local x-axis of the third link is [cos(theta1 + theta2), sin(theta1 + theta2)]
    local_x = math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    local_y = math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(dy, dx) - math.atan2(local_y, local_x)
    
    # Normalize theta3 to the range [-pi, pi]
    theta3 = (theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:

- **θ1 and θ2:** These are calculated using the existing solution, which adjusts the target position based on the lengths of the first two links.
- **θ3:** This is calculated by determining the angle needed to align the TCP with the target position after accounting for the positions of the first two joints. The angle is derived from the vector from the third joint to the target position, considering the local orientation of the third link.
- **Normalization:** The angle θ3 is normalized to the range [-π, π] to ensure it falls within the joint limits.

This revised approach should correctly solve for the joint angles and align the TCP with the target position.
