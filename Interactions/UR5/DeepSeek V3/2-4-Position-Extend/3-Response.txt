Given the feedback, it's clear that the initial approach to solving the inverse kinematics was not accurate. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of `theta2` and `theta3`. The existing solution does not correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator, especially the lengths of the links and the relative positions of the joints.

To address this, we need to consider the geometry more carefully. Specifically, we need to account for the lengths of the links and the relative positions of the joints when calculating `theta2` and `theta3`.

Let's revise the `inverse_kinematics` function to better account for the geometry:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 1 to joint 2
    L2 = 0.093    # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate the position of joint 3
    # Joint 3 is at a distance L1 from joint 1 along the Z-axis and L2 along the Y-axis
    # We need to find the position of joint 3 in the plane defined by theta1
    x3 = x - L3 * math.sin(theta1)
    z3 = z - L3 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle between the links
    # The distance from joint 1 to joint 3 is sqrt(x3^2 + z3^2)
    D = math.sqrt(x3**2 + z3**2)
    # The law of cosines: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(C)
    # Here, a = L1, b = L2, c = D
    # Solving for angle C (theta2)
    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - D**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta3
    # The orientation of the TCP is determined by theta3
    # We can calculate theta3 based on the orientation of the TCP relative to joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, x) - theta1 - theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This revised function takes into account the lengths of the links and the relative positions of the joints. It calculates `theta1` based on the target position, then calculates the position of joint 3. Using the law of cosines, it calculates `theta2` based on the distances between the joints. Finally, it calculates `theta3` based on the orientation of the TCP relative to joint 3.

This approach should provide a more accurate solution to the inverse kinematics problem.
