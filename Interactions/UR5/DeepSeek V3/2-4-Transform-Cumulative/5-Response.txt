The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the argument to `math.sqrt` is negative, which is not allowed. This happens when the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the range `[-1, 1]`, which can occur if the target position is unreachable or if there is a mistake in the calculation.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the value of `cos_theta2` is within the valid range `[-1, 1]`. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the target position is unreachable gracefully.

### Corrected Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)
    
    # Solve for θ₁ (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ (Joint 2)
    # Project the target position onto the XZ plane
    x_prime = x - L2 * math.sin(theta1)
    z_prime = z - L2 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ₂
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)  # Distance from joint 1 to TCP in XZ plane
    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + d**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L1 * d)
    
    # Ensure cos_theta2 is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    if cos_theta2 < -1:
        cos_theta2 = -1
    elif cos_theta2 > 1:
        cos_theta2 = 1
    
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for θ₃ (Joint 3)
    # The orientation is influenced by θ₃
    theta3 = rz  # Directly use the desired Z-axis orientation
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Fixes:

1. **Handling `cos_theta2`**:
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to ensure that the argument to `math.sqrt` is non-negative.
   - This prevents the `ValueError: math domain error` from occurring.

2. **Unreachable Targets**:
   - If the target position is unreachable, the value of `cos_theta2` will be clamped to `-1` or `1`, which corresponds to the joint limits. This ensures that the function does not fail but may not reach the exact target.

### Testing the Solution:

To verify the correctness of the solution, you can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position and orientation. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION 0.457887604396961 0.093 -0.043539053317264 2.58132374681136 0.570490744904781 2.281567742957038
```

This will test the solution against the first failed trial and provide feedback on the accuracy of the joint angles. If the target is reachable, the function should now return valid joint angles without errors.
