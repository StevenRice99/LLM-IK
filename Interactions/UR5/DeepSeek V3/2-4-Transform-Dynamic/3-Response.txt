The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The errors suggest that the approach to solving for θ₂ and θ₃ needs to be revised. Specifically, the current method does not account for the correct geometric relationships between the joints and the TCP.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (θ₁):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane is influenced by θ₁.
   - We can use the `atan2(x, z)` function to solve for θ₁.

2. **Joint 2 (θ₂):**
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane is influenced by θ₂.
   - We need to account for the link lengths and the position of the TCP relative to the second joint.

3. **Joint 3 (θ₃):**
   - The third joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by θ₃.
   - We need to account for the orientation of the TCP relative to the third joint.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Solve for θ₁ (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ (Joint 2)
    # Adjust the position for θ₁
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    z_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1)
    # Calculate the distance from the second joint to the TCP
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + (z_prime - 0.39225)**2)
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ₂
    a = 0.093  # Length of the third link
    b = 0.09465  # Length of the TCP link
    cos_theta2 = (a**2 + d**2 - b**2) / (2 * a * d)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for θ₃ (Joint 3)
    # Adjust the orientation for θ₁ and θ₂
    theta3 = rz - (theta1 + theta2)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation:

- **θ₁ (Joint 1):** We calculate the angle needed to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using `atan2(x, z)`.
- **θ₂ (Joint 2):** We adjust the position for θ₁ and then calculate the angle needed to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using the law of cosines.
- **θ₃ (Joint 3):** We adjust the orientation for θ₁ and θ₂ and then calculate the angle needed to align the TCP's orientation using `rz - (theta1 + theta2)`.

This revised approach should better account for the geometric relationships between the joints and the TCP, leading to more accurate joint angle calculations.
