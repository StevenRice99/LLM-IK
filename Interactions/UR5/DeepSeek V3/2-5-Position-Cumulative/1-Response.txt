To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). We will break down the problem step by step, using the existing solutions as a guide.

### Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))
The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 1** to find \( \theta_1 \):

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))
The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 2** to find \( \theta_2 \). This involves adjusting the target position based on the rotation of the first joint and then solving for \( \theta_2 \):

\[
\text{adjusted\_x} = x - 0.39225 \cdot \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
\text{adjusted\_z} = z - 0.39225 \cdot \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
\theta_{\text{total}} = \text{atan2}(\text{adjusted\_x}, \text{adjusted\_z})
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \theta_{\text{total}} - \theta_1
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))
The third joint rotates around the Z-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 5** to find \( \theta_3 \):

\[
\theta_3 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (\( \theta_4 \))
The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. We can use the existing solution from **EXISTING 7** to find \( \theta_4 \):

\[
\theta_4 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
\]

### Final Solution
Combining all the steps, the inverse kinematics function can be implemented as follows:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).
