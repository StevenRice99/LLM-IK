To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the end-effector (TCP) at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \). We will use the provided existing solutions as a starting point and extend them to solve for all four joints.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We can use the existing solution from `EXISTING 1` to solve for the first joint angle \( \theta_1 \).

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**:
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We need to consider the position of the second joint relative to the first joint.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**:
   - The third joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - We can use the existing solution from `EXISTING 2` to solve for the third joint angle \( \theta_3 \).

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4)**:
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We need to consider the position of the fourth joint relative to the third joint.

### Implementation

We will implement the inverse kinematics function by combining the solutions from the existing code and extending them to solve for all four joints.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    # Considering the position of the second joint relative to the first joint
    # We need to adjust the target position for the second joint
    # The second joint is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the first joint
    x2 = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    # Using the existing solution from EXISTING 2
    A = 0.09465
    B = 0.0823
    cos_theta2 = (y - 0.093) / B
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    
    M = [[A, -B * sin_theta2], [B * sin_theta2, A]]
    det_M = M[0][0] * M[1][1] - M[0][1] * M[1][0]
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * M[1][1], -inv_det_M * M[0][1]], [-inv_det_M * M[1][0], inv_det_M * M[0][0]]]
    sin_theta1 = inv_M[0][0] * x2 + inv_M[0][1] * z2
    cos_theta1 = inv_M[1][0] * x2 + inv_M[1][1] * z2
    sin_theta1 = max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cos_theta1 = max(min(cos_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1_2 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    # Solve for joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    # The fourth joint is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the third joint
    # We need to adjust the target position for the fourth joint
    x4 = x2 - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta1_2)
    z4 = z2 - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta1_2)
    
    # The fourth joint angle is the same as the second joint angle
    theta4 = theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta1_2, theta4)
```

### Explanation

1. **Joint 1**:
   - We calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the `atan2` function to determine the angle required to align the first joint with the target position.

2. **Joint 2**:
   - We adjust the target position for the second joint by subtracting the position of the second joint relative to the first joint.

3. **Joint 3**:
   - We use the existing solution from `EXISTING 2` to solve for \( \theta_3 \). This involves calculating the cosine and sine of \( \theta_2 \) and using matrix inversion to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_3 \).

4. **Joint 4**:
   - We adjust the target position for the fourth joint by subtracting the position of the fourth joint relative to the third joint.
   - The fourth joint angle \( \theta_4 \) is set to be the same as \( \theta_2 \).

This solution provides the joint angles required to position the end-effector at the desired position \( p \).
