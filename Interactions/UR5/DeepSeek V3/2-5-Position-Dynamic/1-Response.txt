To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts. The manipulator consists of four revolute joints, and we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step 1: Solve for Joints 1 and 2
We can use the existing code provided in "EXISTING 1" to solve for the first two joints. This code calculates the angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position \( p \).

### Step 2: Solve for Joints 3 and 4
After determining \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we need to solve for \( \theta_3 \) and \( \theta_4 \). The existing code in "EXISTING 2" can be used to solve for these joints, but it needs to be adapted to account for the position of the TCP relative to the end of the second link.

### Step 3: Combine the Solutions
Finally, we combine the solutions for all four joints to get the complete inverse kinematics solution.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 and theta2 using existing code 1
    theta1, theta2 = inverse_kinematics_joints_1_to_2((x, y, z))
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the position of the end of the second link
    # The second link is along the Y-axis, so we need to account for its length
    # The position of the end of the second link is:
    # x2 = 0.39225 * sin(theta1) + 0.093 * sin(theta1 + theta2)
    # y2 = 0.39225 * cos(theta1) + 0.093 * cos(theta1 + theta2)
    # z2 = 0.0
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 and theta4 using existing code 2
    # The target position for the TCP is relative to the end of the second link
    # So we need to adjust the target position accordingly
    x_tcp = x - (0.39225 * math.sin(theta1) + 0.093 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2))
    y_tcp = y - (0.39225 * math.cos(theta1) + 0.093 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2))
    z_tcp = z
    
    theta3, theta4 = inverse_kinematics_joints_3_to_4((x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)

def inverse_kinematics_joints_1_to_2(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" for joints 1 and 2.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    return (theta1, theta2)

def inverse_kinematics_joints_3_to_4(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" for joints 3 and 4.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta3 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    theta4 = 0.0
    return (theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Step 1**: We use the existing code to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
2. **Step 2**: We calculate the position of the end of the second link based on \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
3. **Step 3**: We adjust the target position for the TCP relative to the end of the second link and solve for \( \theta_3 \) and \( \theta_4 \).

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the positions and orientations of all links in the manipulator chain.
