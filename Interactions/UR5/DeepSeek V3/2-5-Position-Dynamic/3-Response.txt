The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics solver is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the target positions. The primary issue seems to be in the way the positions of the end of the second link and the TCP are being calculated, as well as the handling of the joint angles for joints 3 and 4.

### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Position Calculation for the End of the Second Link**: The current code does not correctly account for the position of the end of the second link relative to the base.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Joints 3 and 4**: The existing code for solving joints 3 and 4 does not account for the position of the TCP relative to the end of the second link.

### Revised Approach:
1. **Correctly Calculate the Position of the End of the Second Link**: The position of the end of the second link should be calculated based on the lengths and orientations of the first two links.
2. **Correctly Solve for Joints 3 and 4**: The position of the TCP relative to the end of the second link should be used to solve for joints 3 and 4.

Here is the revised Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 and theta2 using existing code 1
    theta1, theta2 = inverse_kinematics_joints_1_to_2((x, y, z))
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the position of the end of the second link
    # The second link is along the Y-axis, so we need to account for its length
    # The position of the end of the second link is:
    x2 = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1) + 0.093 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    y2 = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1) + 0.093 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    z2 = 0.0
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 and theta4 using existing code 2
    # The target position for the TCP is relative to the end of the second link
    # So we need to adjust the target position accordingly
    x_tcp = x - x2
    y_tcp = y - y2
    z_tcp = z - z2
    
    theta3, theta4 = inverse_kinematics_joints_3_to_4((x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)

def inverse_kinematics_joints_1_to_2(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" for joints 1 and 2.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    return (theta1, theta2)

def inverse_kinematics_joints_3_to_4(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" for joints 3 and 4.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta3 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    theta4 = 0.0
    return (theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Step 1**: We use the existing code to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
2. **Step 2**: We calculate the position of the end of the second link based on \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
3. **Step 3**: We adjust the target position for the TCP relative to the end of the second link and solve for \( \theta_3 \) and \( \theta_4 \).

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the positions and orientations of all links in the manipulator chain.
