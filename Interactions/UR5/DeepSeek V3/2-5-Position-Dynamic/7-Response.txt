The error indicates that the target position is not reachable, which is likely due to the constraints of the manipulator's geometry. To handle this, we need to ensure that the target position is within the workspace of the manipulator before attempting to calculate the joint angles.

### Revised Approach

1. **Check Reachability**:
   - Before calculating the joint angles, we need to check if the target position is within the workspace of the manipulator. This involves checking if the distance from the base to the target position is within the range of the manipulator's links.

2. **Calculate Joint Angles**:
   - If the target position is reachable, we proceed to calculate the joint angles using the geometric approach.

### Revised Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225
    L2 = 0.093
    L3 = 0.09465
    L4 = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target position
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    s = z - L1
    distance = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)
    
    # Check if the target position is within the workspace
    max_reach = L2 + L3 + L4
    if distance > max_reach:
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable.")
    
    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ2 and θ3
    D_numerator = r**2 + s**2 - L2**2 - L3**2
    D_denominator = 2 * L2 * L3
    D = D_numerator / D_denominator
    
    # Check if D is within the valid range
    if D < -1 or D > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable.")
    
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(s, r) - math.atan2(L3 * math.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * math.cos(theta3))
    
    # Solve for θ4 based on the orientation of the TCP
    theta4 = 0.0  # Assuming no rotation around the Z-axis for simplicity
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation

- **Reachability Check**: We calculate the distance from the base to the target position and check if it is within the maximum reach of the manipulator. If not, we raise a `ValueError`.
- **θ1**: We use the `atan2(y, x)` function to determine the angle based on the x and y coordinates.
- **θ2 and θ3**: We calculate `D` and check if it is within the valid range [-1, 1]. If not, we raise a `ValueError`. If `D` is valid, we proceed to calculate `theta3` and `theta2`.
- **θ4**: We set θ4 to 0.0 radians for simplicity, assuming no rotation around the Z-axis.

This revised function should handle the reachability check and provide a more robust solution for the inverse kinematics of the 4 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator.
