The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not accurately calculating the joint angles to reach the desired positions. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint values suggest that the approach needs to be revised. Let's re-examine the problem and develop a more accurate solution.

### Revised Approach

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We can use the `atan2` function to determine the angle required to align the first joint with the target position.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**:
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We need to consider the position of the second joint relative to the first joint.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**:
   - The third joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - We need to calculate the angle based on the position of the third joint relative to the second joint.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4)**:
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - We need to calculate the angle based on the position of the fourth joint relative to the third joint.

### Revised Implementation

We will implement the inverse kinematics function by considering the relative positions and orientations of each joint.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    # Considering the position of the second joint relative to the first joint
    # The second joint is at [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the first joint
    x2 = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    # The third joint is at [0, 0.093, 0] relative to the second joint
    y3 = y - 0.093
    distance = math.sqrt(x2**2 + y3**2 + z2**2)
    if distance > 0.09465 + 0.0823:
        raise ValueError('Target position is not reachable.')
    
    # Using the law of cosines to solve for theta2
    A = 0.09465
    B = 0.0823
    cos_theta2 = (A**2 + B**2 - distance**2) / (2 * A * B)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    # The fourth joint is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the third joint
    # We need to adjust the target position for the fourth joint
    x4 = x2 - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    z4 = z2 - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # The fourth joint angle is the same as the second joint angle
    theta4 = theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta1 + theta2, theta4)
```

### Explanation

1. **Joint 1**:
   - We calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the `atan2` function to determine the angle required to align the first joint with the target position.

2. **Joint 2**:
   - We adjust the target position for the second joint by subtracting the position of the second joint relative to the first joint.

3. **Joint 3**:
   - We calculate the distance from the second joint to the target position.
   - We use the law of cosines to solve for \( \theta_2 \).
   - We clamp the value of `cos_theta2` to ensure it is within the valid range [-1, 1] before passing it to `math.acos`.

4. **Joint 4**:
   - We adjust the target position for the fourth joint by subtracting the position of the fourth joint relative to the third joint.
   - The fourth joint angle \( \theta_4 \) is set to be the same as \( \theta_2 \).

This revised solution should handle the floating-point inaccuracies and provide accurate joint angles to position the end-effector at the desired position \( p \).
