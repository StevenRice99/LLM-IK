The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is still not producing the correct joint angles to reach the target positions. The discrepancies between the expected and actual joint values suggest that the geometric relationships and trigonometric calculations in the solution are incorrect. To address this, we need to re-examine the problem and derive a more accurate solution.

---

### Step 1: Re-examining the Problem
The manipulator has four revolute joints with the following properties:
1. **Joint 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
2. **Joint 2**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
3. **Joint 3**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
4. **Joint 4**: Rotates around the Y-axis.

The TCP is located at the end of the fourth link. The goal is to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) such that the TCP reaches the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

---

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics of the manipulator can be expressed as a series of transformations:
1. Rotate by \( \theta_1 \) around the Y-axis.
2. Translate along the Z-axis by \( 0.39225 \).
3. Rotate by \( \theta_2 \) around the Y-axis.
4. Translate along the Y-axis by \( 0.093 \).
5. Rotate by \( \theta_3 \) around the Z-axis.
6. Translate along the Z-axis by \( 0.09465 \).
7. Rotate by \( \theta_4 \) around the Y-axis.
8. Translate along the Y-axis by \( 0.0823 \).

The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be derived from these transformations.

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
To solve the inverse kinematics, we need to determine \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) such that the TCP reaches the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

#### Step 3.1: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint rotates around the Y-axis, so \( \theta_1 \) can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the XZ plane:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

#### Step 3.2: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
After rotating by \( \theta_1 \), the problem reduces to a 3-DOF manipulator in the YZ plane. The second joint rotates around the Y-axis, so \( \theta_2 \) can be determined by the distance from the origin to the target in the YZ plane:
\[
d = \sqrt{y^2 + (z \cos \theta_1 - x \sin \theta_1)^2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \arctan2(y, z \cos \theta_1 - x \sin \theta_1)
\]

#### Step 3.3: Solve for \( \theta_3 \)
The third joint rotates around the Z-axis, so \( \theta_3 \) can be determined by the orientation of the TCP in the XY plane:
\[
\theta_3 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

#### Step 3.4: Solve for \( \theta_4 \)
The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis, so \( \theta_4 \) can be determined by the final orientation of the TCP:
\[
\theta_4 = \arctan2(z \cos \theta_1 - x \sin \theta_1, y)
\]

---

### Step 4: Updated Python Implementation
The initial implementation was incorrect because it did not account for the link lengths and transformations properly. Hereâ€™s the updated implementation:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    d = np.sqrt(y^2 + (z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1))^2)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y, z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1))
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = np.arctan2(z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1), y)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

---

### Step 5: Testing the Solution
To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to test the updated implementation. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION 0.198520422463753 0.023288253734007003 0.209160930525798
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the updated inverse kinematics solution. If the solution is correct, the TCP should reach the target position. If not, further adjustments to the inverse kinematics calculations will be necessary.
