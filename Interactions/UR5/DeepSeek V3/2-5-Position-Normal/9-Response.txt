The error occurs because the `^` operator in Python is the **bitwise XOR operator**, not the exponentiation operator. For exponentiation, you should use `**`. This is a common mistake when translating mathematical formulas into code.

Letâ€™s fix the code by replacing `^` with `**` for exponentiation.

### Corrected Python Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    d = np.sqrt(y**2 + (z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1))**2)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y, z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1))
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = np.arctan2(z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1), y)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Exponentiation Fix**:
   - Replaced `y ^ 2` with `y**2` and `(z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1)) ^ 2` with `(z * np.cos(theta1) - x * np.sin(theta1))**2`.
   - The `**` operator is the correct way to perform exponentiation in Python.

2. **No Other Changes**:
   - The rest of the code remains the same, as the logic for calculating the joint angles is correct.

### Testing the Solution
To verify the correctness of the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to test the updated implementation. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION 0.198520422463753 0.023288253734007003 0.209160930525798
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the updated inverse kinematics solution. If the solution is correct, the TCP should reach the target position. If not, further adjustments to the inverse kinematics calculations will be necessary.
