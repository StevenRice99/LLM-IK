To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position and orient the TCP at the desired target. We will use the existing solutions for each joint as a starting point and extend them to solve for the entire chain.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the base is influenced by the rotation of Joint 1.
   - We can use the existing solution for Joint 1 to find the angle `theta1` that aligns the TCP in the X-Z plane.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the first link is influenced by the rotation of Joint 2.
   - We can use the existing solution for Joint 2 to find the angle `theta2` that aligns the TCP in the X-Z plane.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the second link is influenced by the rotation of Joint 3.
   - We can use the existing solution for Joint 3 to find the angle `theta3` that aligns the TCP in the X-Y plane.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the third link is influenced by the rotation of Joint 4.
   - We can use the existing solution for Joint 4 to find the angle `theta4` that aligns the TCP in the X-Z plane.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis
    # Adjust the position for Joint 1 rotation
    x2 = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    z2 = -x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2 - 0.39225)
    
    # Joint 3: Rotates around Z-axis
    # Adjust the position for Joint 2 rotation
    x3 = x2 * math.cos(theta2) + (z2 - 0.39225) * math.sin(theta2)
    y3 = y - 0.093
    theta3 = math.atan2(y3, x3)
    
    # Joint 4: Rotates around Y-axis
    # Adjust the position for Joint 3 rotation
    x4 = x3 * math.cos(theta3) - y3 * math.sin(theta3)
    z4 = 0.09465
    theta4 = math.atan2(x4, z4)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1 (`theta1`):** We calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using `atan2(x, z)`.
- **Joint 2 (`theta2`):** We adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 1 and calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using `atan2(x2, z2 - 0.39225)`.
- **Joint 3 (`theta3`):** We adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 2 and calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Y plane using `atan2(y3, x3)`.
- **Joint 4 (`theta4`):** We adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 3 and calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using `atan2(x4, z4)`.

This solution assumes that the target is reachable and does not check for joint limits or singularities.
