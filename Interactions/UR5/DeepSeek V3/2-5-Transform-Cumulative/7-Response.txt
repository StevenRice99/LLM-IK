The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics solution still fails to reach the target positions and orientations. The main issue seems to be the incorrect handling of the joint angles and the transformations between the links, particularly in accounting for the orientation of the TCP. To address this, we need to incorporate the orientation into the inverse kinematics solution and ensure that the transformations between links are correctly applied.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the base is influenced by the rotation of Joint 1.
   - We can use the existing solution for Joint 1 to find the angle `theta1` that aligns the TCP in the X-Z plane.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the first link is influenced by the rotation of Joint 2.
   - We need to adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 1 and then calculate the angle `theta2`.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The third joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the second link is influenced by the rotation of Joint 3.
   - We need to adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 2 and then calculate the angle `theta3`.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The position of the TCP relative to the third link is influenced by the rotation of Joint 4.
   - We need to adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 3 and then calculate the angle `theta4`.

### Revised Implementation:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Transform the target position to the frame of Joint 1
    x1 = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    z1 = -x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Joint 2: Rotates around Y-axis
    # Adjust the position for Joint 1 rotation
    x2 = x1
    z2 = z1 - 0.39225
    theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2)
    
    # Transform the target position to the frame of Joint 2
    x3 = x2 * math.cos(theta2) + z2 * math.sin(theta2)
    y3 = y - 0.093
    
    # Joint 3: Rotates around Z-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(y3, x3)
    
    # Transform the target position to the frame of Joint 3
    x4 = x3 * math.cos(theta3) - y3 * math.sin(theta3)
    z4 = 0.09465
    
    # Joint 4: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta4 = math.atan2(x4, z4)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 1 (`theta1`):** We calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using `atan2(x, z)`.
- **Joint 2 (`theta2`):** We adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 1 and calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using `atan2(x2, z2)`.
- **Joint 3 (`theta3`):** We adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 2 and calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Y plane using `atan2(y3, x3)`.
- **Joint 4 (`theta4`):** We adjust the position for the rotation of Joint 3 and calculate the angle to align the TCP in the X-Z plane using `atan2(x4, z4)`.

This revised solution should better handle the transformations between the links and correctly reach the target positions and orientations.
