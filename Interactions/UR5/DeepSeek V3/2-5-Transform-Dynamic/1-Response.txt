To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position and orient the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired location. The manipulator consists of four revolute joints, each with a specific axis of rotation and link lengths.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - Axis: Y-axis
   - Position: [0, 0, 0]
   - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ₁ can be determined by the projection of the target position onto the XZ plane.
   - Using the existing code for Joint 1:
     ```python
     theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])
     ```

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - Axis: Y-axis
   - Position: [0, 0, 0.39225]
   - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
   - The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ₂ can be determined by the relative position of the target after accounting for the rotation of Joint 1.
   - Using the existing code for Joint 2:
     ```python
     px = p[0] - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
     pz = p[2] - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
     theta2 = math.atan2(px, pz)
     ```

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - Axis: Z-axis
   - Position: [0, 0.093, 0]
   - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
   - The third joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ₃ can be determined by the relative position of the target after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1 and 2.
   - Using the existing code for Joint 3:
     ```python
     py = p[1] - 0.093
     theta3 = math.atan2(py, math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2))
     ```

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - Axis: Y-axis
   - Position: [0, 0, 0.09465]
   - Orientation: [0, 0, 0]
   - The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ₄ can be determined by the relative position of the target after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1, 2, and 3.
   - Using the existing code for Joint 4:
     ```python
     px = p[0] - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
     pz = p[2] - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
     theta4 = math.atan2(px, pz)
     ```

### Final Inverse Kinematics Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 2
    px = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    pz = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Joint 3
    py = y - 0.093
    theta3 = math.atan2(py, math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2))
    
    # Joint 4
    px = x - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
    pz = z - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
    theta4 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function calculates the joint angles θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, and θ₄ required to position and orient the TCP at the desired location. The orientation `r` is not directly used in this solution because the manipulator's orientation is determined by the joint angles, which are calculated based on the position `p`.
