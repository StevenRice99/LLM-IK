The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the desired position and orientation. The issue likely arises from the way the joint angles are being computed, particularly in how the transformations between links are handled.

To address this, we need to consider the full transformation chain from the base to the TCP, including the orientation. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by all four joints, so we need to account for the cumulative effect of each joint's rotation.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The angle θ₁ is determined by the projection of the target position onto the XZ plane.
   - `theta1 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])`

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The angle θ₂ is determined by the relative position of the target after accounting for the rotation of Joint 1.
   - `px = p[0] - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)`
   - `pz = p[2] - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)`
   - `theta2 = math.atan2(px, pz)`

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - Rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The angle θ₃ is determined by the relative position of the target after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1 and 2.
   - `py = p[1] - 0.093`
   - `theta3 = math.atan2(py, math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2))`

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**
   - Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The angle θ₄ is determined by the relative position of the target after accounting for the rotations of Joints 1, 2, and 3.
   - `px = p[0] - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)`
   - `pz = p[2] - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)`
   - `theta4 = math.atan2(px, pz)`

### Final Inverse Kinematics Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 2
    px = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    pz = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Joint 3
    py = y - 0.093
    theta3 = math.atan2(py, math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2))
    
    # Joint 4
    px = x - 0.09465 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
    pz = z - 0.09465 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2 + theta3)
    theta4 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Explanation:

- **Joint 1:** The angle θ₁ is calculated based on the projection of the target position onto the XZ plane.
- **Joint 2:** The angle θ₂ is calculated after adjusting the target position by the effect of Joint 1.
- **Joint 3:** The angle θ₃ is calculated after adjusting the target position by the effects of Joints 1 and 2.
- **Joint 4:** The angle θ₄ is calculated after adjusting the target position by the effects of Joints 1, 2, and 3.

This approach ensures that the cumulative effect of each joint's rotation is considered, leading to a more accurate inverse kinematics solution.
