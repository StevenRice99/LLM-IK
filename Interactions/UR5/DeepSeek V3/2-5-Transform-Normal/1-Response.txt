To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 4-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles that will position the TCP at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \) and orientation \( r = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \).

### Step 1: Understand the Robot Structure
The robot has four revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
3. **Revolute 3**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
4. **Revolute 4**: Rotates around the Y-axis.

The TCP is located at the end of the fourth link.

### Step 2: Define the Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics can be represented as a series of transformations:
- **T1**: Transformation from the base to the first joint.
- **T2**: Transformation from the first joint to the second joint.
- **T3**: Transformation from the second joint to the third joint.
- **T4**: Transformation from the third joint to the fourth joint.
- **T5**: Transformation from the fourth joint to the TCP.

Each transformation \( T_i \) is a combination of a rotation and a translation.

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles
We need to solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) such that the TCP reaches the desired position and orientation.

#### Step 3.1: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the XZ plane is influenced by \( \theta_1 \). We can solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the arctangent function:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

#### Step 3.2: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The second joint also rotates around the Y-axis. After applying \( \theta_1 \), the position of the TCP in the YZ plane is influenced by \( \theta_2 \). We can solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the arctangent function:
\[
\theta_2 = \arctan2(y, z')
\]
where \( z' \) is the Z-coordinate after applying \( \theta_1 \).

#### Step 3.3: Solve for \( \theta_3 \)
The third joint rotates around the Z-axis. This joint affects the orientation of the TCP. We can solve for \( \theta_3 \) using the desired orientation \( r_z \):
\[
\theta_3 = r_z
\]

#### Step 3.4: Solve for \( \theta_4 \)
The fourth joint rotates around the Y-axis. This joint affects the final orientation of the TCP. We can solve for \( \theta_4 \) using the desired orientation \( r_y \):
\[
\theta_4 = r_y
\]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution in Python
Now, we can implement the solution in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    z_prime = z / np.cos(theta1)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y, z_prime)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = r_z
    
    # Solve for theta4
    theta4 = r_y
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, you can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target position and orientation.

```python
TEST_SOLUTION x y z r_x r_y r_z
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution.
