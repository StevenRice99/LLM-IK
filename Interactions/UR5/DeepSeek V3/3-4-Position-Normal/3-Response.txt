The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly calculating the joint angles to reach the desired positions. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). Let's re-examine the approach and correct the calculations.

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 rotates around the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 rotates around the Z-axis.
- The position of Revolute 2 relative to Revolute 1 is [0, 0.093, 0].
- The position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2 is [0, 0, 0.09465].

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.093 \) (distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along the Y-axis).
- \( L_2 = 0.09465 \) (distance from Revolute 2 to the TCP along the Z-axis).

The position of the TCP in the global coordinate system can be expressed as:
\[
\begin{aligned}
x &= L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2) \\
y &= L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_1) \\
z &= L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2)
\end{aligned}
\]
where \( \theta_1 \) is the angle of Revolute 1 and \( \theta_2 \) is the angle of Revolute 2.

To find \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we need to solve these equations correctly.

First, let's solve for \( \theta_1 \):
\[
y = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_1) \\
\Rightarrow \cos(\theta_1) = \frac{y - L_1}{L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \arccos\left(\frac{y - L_1}{L_2}\right)
\]

Next, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the equations for \( x \) and \( z \):
\[
x = L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2) \\
z = L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
\Rightarrow \tan(\theta_2) = \frac{z}{x} \\
\Rightarrow \theta_2 = \arctan2(z, x)
\]

However, the feedback shows that this approach is not working correctly. Let's try a different approach by considering the geometry of the manipulator.

The position of the TCP can be represented in polar coordinates relative to Revolute 1. The distance from Revolute 1 to the TCP is:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
\]
The angle \( \phi \) between the line from Revolute 1 to the TCP and the Y-axis is:
\[
\phi = \arctan2(r, y - L_1)
\]

The joint angles can then be calculated as:
\[
\theta_1 = \phi \\
\theta_2 = \arctan2(z, x)
\]

Let's implement this corrected approach in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.093
    L2 = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate the distance from Revolute 1 to the TCP in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    
    # Calculate the angle phi between the line from Revolute 1 to the TCP and the Y-axis
    phi = math.atan2(r, y - L1)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = phi
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(z, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This corrected function should now correctly calculate the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).
