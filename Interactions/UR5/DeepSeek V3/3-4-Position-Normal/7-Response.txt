Given the persistent issues with the inverse kinematics solution, it's clear that the initial approach is not correctly handling the joint angles for certain positions. Let's re-examine the problem and adjust the approach accordingly.

### Revised Approach

1. **Calculate the distance from the origin to the target point in the XY plane:**
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

2. **Use the law of cosines to find \( \theta_2 \):**
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \pm \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)
\]

3. **Use the law of sines to find \( \theta_1 \):**
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x) - \arctan2\left(L_2 \sin(\theta_2), L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)\right)
\]

### Corrected Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.093
    L2 = 0.09465
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the target point in the XY plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Ensure the value is within the valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1 using the law of sines
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`:** The value of `cos_theta2` must be within the range \([-1, 1]\) for `math.acos` to work correctly. We use `max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)` to ensure this.

2. **Correct Calculation of `theta1`:** The calculation of `theta1` uses `math.atan2` to handle the quadrant correctly and ensures the correct angle is computed.

### Testing the Function

To verify the correctness of the function, we can use the provided test cases and compare the results with the correct joint values. Let's test the function with one of the provided positions:

```python
# Test position
p = (-0.09315733329912501, 0.093, 0.016743170326905)

# Expected joint values
expected_joints = (-1.39296489815784, 0)

# Calculate joint values using the function
calculated_joints = inverse_kinematics(p)

print("Expected Joints:", expected_joints)
print("Calculated Joints:", calculated_joints)
```

This will help us verify if the function is now correctly calculating the joint angles.
