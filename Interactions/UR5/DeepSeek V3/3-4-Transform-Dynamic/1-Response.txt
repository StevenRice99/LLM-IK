To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. Given the details of the manipulator, we can approach this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Manipulator
- **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
- **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
- **TCP**: The end-effector position is influenced by both joints.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
First, let's understand how the position of the TCP is determined by the joint angles. The position of the TCP can be calculated using the forward kinematics equations based on the joint angles.

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
We need to find the joint angles that will result in the desired TCP position and orientation. Given that the manipulator has 2 degrees of freedom, we can use geometric methods to solve for the joint angles.

### Step 4: Implementing the Solution
We will use the existing code as a reference to solve for the joint angles. The existing code provides solutions for sub-chains, which we can extend to solve for the entire chain.

Let's start by implementing the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # We need to consider the length of the second link (0.093) and the TCP offset (0.09465)
    # The position of the second joint is at [0, 0.093, 0]
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the second joint
    # We can use the existing code to solve for joint2
    # The position to reach is the projection of the TCP position onto the XY plane
    # Since the second joint rotates around the Z-axis, we can use the atan2 function
    # to find the angle between the X-axis and the line from the second joint to the TCP
    # The position of the TCP relative to the second joint is [0, 0, 0.09465]
    # So, the position to reach is [x, y, z] - [0, 0.093, 0] = [x, y - 0.093, z]
    # We can then use the existing code to solve for joint2
    # The existing code solves for the angle in the XY plane
    # So, we can use the x and y coordinates of the TCP relative to the second joint
    x_rel = x
    y_rel = y - 0.093
    joint2 = math.atan2(x_rel, y_rel)
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joint1**: The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. We use the `atan2` function to calculate the angle between the X-axis and the line from the origin to the projected position of the TCP on the XZ plane.
2. **Joint2**: The second joint rotates around the Z-axis. We calculate the position of the TCP relative to the second joint and use the `atan2` function to find the angle between the X-axis and the line from the second joint to the TCP.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not check for any limits on the joint angles. The function returns the joint angles in radians.
