To address the issues identified in the feedback, we need to refine the inverse kinematics solution further. The main problem seems to be with the calculation of `joint2`. The current approach does not correctly account for the orientation and the relative position of the TCP. Let's revise the function to better handle these aspects.

### Revised Solution

1. **Joint1**: The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. We use the `atan2` function to calculate the angle between the X-axis and the line from the origin to the projected position of the TCP on the XZ plane.
2. **Joint2**: The second joint rotates around the Z-axis. We need to consider the orientation and the relative position of the TCP more accurately.

Here's the revised code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    # The position of the second joint is at [0, 0.093, 0]
    # The TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the second joint
    # We need to consider the orientation to calculate joint2
    # The orientation is given by the roll, pitch, and yaw angles
    # We can use the yaw angle to determine the rotation around the Z-axis
    # Adjust joint2 based on the relative position and orientation
    joint2 = yaw - joint1
    
    # Normalize joint2 to be within the limits [-pi, pi]
    if joint2 > math.pi:
        joint2 -= 2 * math.pi
    elif joint2 < -math.pi:
        joint2 += 2 * math.pi
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joint1**: The calculation remains the same as before.
2. **Joint2**: Instead of using the yaw angle directly, we adjust it based on the value of `joint1`. Additionally, we normalize `joint2` to ensure it falls within the limits of `[-pi, pi]`.

This revised solution should better handle the orientation and position of the TCP, leading to more accurate joint angles.
