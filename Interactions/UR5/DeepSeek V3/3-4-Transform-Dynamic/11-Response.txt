The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not correctly solving for the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). The primary issue seems to be the incorrect calculation of \(\theta_2\), as it consistently returns the same value (`1.3838014985086557`) across all test cases. This suggests that the formula for \(\theta_2\) is flawed.

### Revised Solution:

1. **Re-examining the Manipulator Structure:**
   - **Revolute 1:** Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - **Revolute 2:** Rotates around the Z-axis.
   - **TCP:** Located at \([0, 0, 0.09465]\) relative to Revolute 2.

2. **Correct Position of TCP in World Coordinates:**
   The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be expressed as:
   \[
   \begin{aligned}
   x &= (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \cos(\theta_1) \\
   y &= l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \\
   z &= (l_1 + l_2 \cos(\theta_2)) \sin(\theta_1)
   \end{aligned}
   \]
   where \(l_1 = 0.093\) is the length of Revolute 2, and \(l_2 = 0.09465\) is the length of the TCP.

3. **Solve for \(\theta_2\):**
   From the \(y\) equation:
   \[
   y = l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \implies \sin(\theta_2) = \frac{y}{l_2}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{y}{l_2}\right)
   \]

4. **Solve for \(\theta_1\):**
   From the \(x\) and \(z\) equations:
   \[
   \frac{x}{z} = \frac{\cos(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_1)} = \cot(\theta_1)
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(z, x)
   \]

5. **Orientation:**
   The orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\) is directly related to the joint angles. Since the manipulator has only 2 DOF, the orientation is determined by \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

### Revised Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    l1 = 0.093  # Length of Revolute 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Length of TCP

    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = math.asin(y / l2)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z, x)

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta2:** Calculated using the \(\arcsin\) function based on the \(y\) coordinate.
- **theta1:** Calculated using the \(\arctan2\) function based on the \(x\) and \(z\) coordinates.

This revised solution should correctly compute the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) to reach the desired position and orientation.
