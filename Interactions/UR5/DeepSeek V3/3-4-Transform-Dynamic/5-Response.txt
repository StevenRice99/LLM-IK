To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` with the desired orientation `r`.

Given the forward kinematics result, we can see that the TCP position is influenced by both joint1 and joint2. The position of the TCP is determined by the lengths of the links and the angles of the joints.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Position of TCP**: The TCP position is given by the forward kinematics as `[0, 0.093, 0.09465]` when both joint1 and joint2 are set to 0. This means that the TCP is at a position that is 0.093 meters along the Y-axis and 0.09465 meters along the Z-axis from the base.

2. **Desired Position**: The desired position `p` is given as `[x, y, z]`. We need to find the joint angles that will move the TCP to this position.

3. **Orientation**: The desired orientation `r` is given as `[x, y, z]` in radians. However, since the manipulator has only 2 degrees of freedom, the orientation is constrained by the joint angles.

4. **Joint Limits**: The joint limits for both joints are `[-6.2831853, 6.2831853]` radians, which means they can rotate full circles.

To solve for the joint angles, we can use the following approach:

- **Joint1 (Revolute 1)**: This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle for joint1 can be found using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates of the desired position.
  
  \[
  \text{joint1} = \text{atan2}(p_x, p_z)
  \]

- **Joint2 (Revolute 2)**: This joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle for joint2 can be found using the arctangent of the Y coordinate and the distance in the X-Z plane.

  \[
  \text{joint2} = \text{atan2}(p_y, \sqrt{p_x^2 + p_z^2})
  \]

Now, let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    joint1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    joint2 = math.atan2(py, math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2))
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

This function calculates the required joint angles to position the TCP at the desired position `p` with the desired orientation `r`. The function returns the joint angles in radians.
