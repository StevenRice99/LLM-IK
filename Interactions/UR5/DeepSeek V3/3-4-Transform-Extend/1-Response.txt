To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. Given the details of the manipulator, we can approach this problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Manipulator
- **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
- **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
- **TCP**: The end-effector position is influenced by both joints.

### Step 2: Position Analysis
The position of the TCP is influenced by both joints. We can use the forward kinematics to express the position of the TCP in terms of the joint angles.

### Step 3: Orientation Analysis
The orientation of the TCP is also influenced by both joints. We need to ensure that the orientation `r` is achieved by the combination of the joint angles.

### Step 4: Solving for Joint Angles
We will use trigonometric relationships to solve for the joint angles. Given the position `p` and orientation `r`, we can derive the necessary joint angles.

Let's start by defining the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Lengths of the links
    L1 = 0.093  # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length from Revolute 2 to TCP
    
    # Calculate joint2 using the law of cosines
    D = (px**2 + py**2 + pz**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    joint2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Calculate joint1
    joint1 = math.atan2(py, px) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(joint2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(joint2))
    
    return joint1, joint2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position Analysis**:
   - We use the law of cosines to solve for `joint2`.
   - The distance `D` is calculated using the coordinates of the TCP and the lengths of the links.

2. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - The orientation `r` is used to adjust the joint angles to achieve the desired orientation.
   - `joint1` is calculated using the arctangent of the y and x coordinates, adjusted by the angle contributed by `joint2`.

This function will return the joint angles `joint1` and `joint2` needed to position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`.
