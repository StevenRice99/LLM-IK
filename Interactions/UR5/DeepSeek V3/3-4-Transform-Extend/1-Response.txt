To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\) with the desired orientation \(r = [\phi, \theta, \psi]\).

### Step 1: Understanding the Manipulator
The manipulator consists of two revolute joints:
- **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
- **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Z-axis.

The TCP is located at the end of the second link, with an offset of \([0, 0, 0.09465]\) from the second joint.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be derived using the forward kinematics equations. The position of the TCP is influenced by both \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
We need to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) given the target position \(p = [x, y, z]\).

#### Step 3.1: Solve for \(\theta_1\)
The first joint rotates around the Y-axis, so it affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP. We can use the `atan2` function to find \(\theta_1\):

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
\]

#### Step 3.2: Solve for \(\theta_2\)
After determining \(\theta_1\), we can solve for \(\theta_2\). The second joint rotates around the Z-axis, affecting the Y coordinate of the TCP. The Y coordinate of the TCP is influenced by both \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

Given the position of the TCP, we can derive \(\theta_2\) using the following equation:

\[
\theta_2 = \text{atan2}(y, \sqrt{x^2 + z^2})
\]

### Step 4: Implementation
We will implement the above steps in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (rotation around Z-axis)
    theta2 = math.atan2(y, math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1**: This is the angle of the first joint, which rotates around the Y-axis. It is calculated using the `atan2` function with the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
- **theta2**: This is the angle of the second joint, which rotates around the Z-axis. It is calculated using the `atan2` function with the Y coordinate and the magnitude of the X and Z coordinates.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not account for joint limits or singularities.
