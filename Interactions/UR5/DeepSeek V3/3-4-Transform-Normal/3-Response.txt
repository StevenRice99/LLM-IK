The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). The primary issue lies in the way \( \theta_1 \) is being calculated. Specifically, the formula for \( \theta_1 \) does not account for the correct relationship between the x and y coordinates and the joint angles.

### Revised Approach

#### Step 1: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The z-coordinate equation remains the same:
\[
z = L_2 \sin(\theta_2)
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{z}{L_2}\right)
\]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The x and y coordinates are influenced by both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). The correct relationship is:
\[
x = L_2 \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
\]
We can rewrite these equations as:
\[
x = L_2 \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y = \sin(\theta_1) (L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2))
\]
From the x-equation, we can solve for \( \cos(\theta_1) \):
\[
\cos(\theta_1) = \frac{x}{L_2 \cos(\theta_2)}
\]
From the y-equation, we can solve for \( \sin(\theta_1) \):
\[
\sin(\theta_1) = \frac{y}{L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)}
\]
Now, we can use the `arctan2` function to solve for \( \theta_1 \):
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2\left(\frac{y}{L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)}, \frac{x}{L_2 \cos(\theta_2)}\right)
\]

### Revised Python Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.093
    L2 = 0.09465
    
    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = np.arcsin(z / L2)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    denominator = L1 + L2 * np.cos(theta2)
    sin_theta1 = y / denominator
    cos_theta1 = x / (L2 * np.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = np.arctan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation
1. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**: This remains unchanged from the previous implementation.
2. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**: We now use the `arctan2` function to correctly compute \( \theta_1 \) based on the relationships derived from the x and y coordinates.

This revised implementation should correctly solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to reach the desired position and orientation.
