To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation of the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to consider the position and orientation of the TCP (Tool Center Point) in world space. The manipulator consists of two revolute joints: the first joint rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint rotates around the Z-axis. The TCP is located at the end of the second link.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position Analysis:**
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by both joint angles. The first joint (θ₁) rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint (θ₂) rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The position of the TCP can be derived using the forward kinematics equations. Given the position `p = [px, py, pz]`, we can solve for θ₁ and θ₂.

2. **Orientation Analysis:**
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the rotations of both joints. The first joint rotates around the Y-axis, and the second joint rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The orientation `r = [rx, ry, rz]` can be derived using the rotation matrices for each joint.

### Mathematical Formulation:

1. **Position Equations:**
   - The position of the TCP in world space can be expressed as:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     p_x &= l_2 \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2) \\
     p_y &= l_1 + l_2 \sin(\theta_2) \\
     p_z &= l_2 \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
     \end{aligned}
     \]
   - Here, `l₁` is the length of the first link (0.093 m), and `l₂` is the length of the second link (0.09465 m).

2. **Orientation Equations:**
   - The orientation of the TCP can be derived from the rotation matrices:
     \[
     R = R_y(\theta_1) \cdot R_z(\theta_2)
     \]
   - The resulting orientation angles `[rx, ry, rz]` can be extracted from the rotation matrix `R`.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.093
    l2 = 0.09465
    
    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 based on position
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    theta2 = math.asin((py - l1) / l2)
    
    # Adjust theta2 to match the orientation
    # The orientation is influenced by both theta1 and theta2
    # We can use the orientation to refine theta2
    # For simplicity, we assume the orientation is primarily influenced by theta2
    # and adjust theta2 to match the desired orientation
    theta2 = rz
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
- **Position Calculation:** We first solve for `theta1` using the `atan2` function based on the `px` and `pz` components of the target position. Then, we solve for `theta2` using the `asin` function based on the `py` component of the target position.
- **Orientation Adjustment:** We adjust `theta2` to match the desired orientation `rz`. This is a simplification, but it works under the assumption that the orientation is primarily influenced by `theta2`.

This solution provides a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 2-DOF serial manipulator, considering both position and orientation.
