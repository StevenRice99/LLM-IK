The feedback indicates that the updated solution still fails to reach the target positions. The issue lies in the incorrect calculation of \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\). Let’s re-examine the problem and derive a correct solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Joint 1 (\(\theta_1\))**:
   - Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The initial solution used \(\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)\), which is correct for determining the angle in the XZ plane.

2. **Joint 2 (\(\theta_2\))**:
   - Rotates around the Z-axis.
   - The initial solution used \(\theta_2 = \text{atan2}(y, \sqrt{x^2 + z^2})\), which is incorrect. Instead, \(\theta_2\) should account for the geometry of the manipulator and the position of the second link.

3. **Joint 3 (\(\theta_3\))**:
   - Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The initial solution used \(\theta_3 = \text{atan2}(y, \sqrt{x^2 + z^2})\), which is incorrect. Instead, \(\theta_3\) should account for the remaining distance to the target after accounting for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

### Correct Solution:
To solve the inverse kinematics, we need to account for the geometry of the manipulator and the positions of the links. Here’s the step-by-step approach:

1. **Joint 1 (\(\theta_1\))**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \(\theta_1\) is calculated based on the projection of the target position onto the XZ plane:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
     \]

2. **Joint 2 (\(\theta_2\))**:
   - After determining \(\theta_1\), we compute the position of the end of the second link in the XZ plane. The angle \(\theta_2\) is calculated based on the remaining distance to the target:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(y, \sqrt{x^2 + z^2} - 0.093)
     \]

3. **Joint 3 (\(\theta_3\))**:
   - After determining \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\), we compute the position of the end of the third link. The angle \(\theta_3\) is calculated based on the remaining distance to the target:
     \[
     \theta_3 = \text{atan2}(y, \sqrt{x^2 + z^2} - 0.093 - 0.09465)
     \]

### Updated Inverse Kinematics Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Joint 1: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Joint 2: Rotates around Z-axis
    theta2 = math.atan2(y, math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2) - 0.093)
    
    # Joint 3: Rotates around Y-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2) - 0.093 - 0.09465)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Joint 1 (\(\theta_1\))**:
   - The angle is calculated based on the projection of the target position onto the XZ plane using \(\text{atan2}(x, z)\).

2. **Joint 2 (\(\theta_2\))**:
   - The angle is calculated based on the remaining distance to the target after accounting for \(\theta_1\) and the length of the first link (0.093).

3. **Joint 3 (\(\theta_3\))**:
   - The angle is calculated based on the remaining distance to the target after accounting for \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and the length of the second link (0.09465).

This solution should now correctly compute the joint angles required to reach the target position. If further adjustments are needed, we can refine the calculations based on additional feedback.
