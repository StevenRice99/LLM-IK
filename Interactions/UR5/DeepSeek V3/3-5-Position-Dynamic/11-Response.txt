Given the feedback, it's clear that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics is not producing the correct joint angles to reach the target positions. The main issue is that the geometric approach used does not account for the specific configuration and constraints of the manipulator. Let's re-evaluate the problem and develop a correct solution.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Manipulator Configuration:**
   - **Revolute 1:** Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - **Revolute 2:** Rotates around the Z-axis.
   - **Revolute 3:** Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - **TCP Position:** The end-effector position is influenced by all three joints.

2. **Geometric Approach:**
   - The position of the TCP is determined by the combined effect of the three joints.
   - We need to consider the lengths of the links and the angles of the joints to determine the TCP position.

3. **Inverse Kinematics Equations:**
   - We need to derive the equations that relate the joint angles to the TCP position.
   - This involves solving for the joint angles given the desired TCP position.

### Correct Implementation

Let's implement the correct inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.093
    L2 = 0.09465
    L3 = 0.0823
    
    # Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    D = (r**2 + y**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Check if the target position is reachable
    if abs(D) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach.")
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(-math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Solve for θ3 (Revolute 3)
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, r) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ1 (Revolute 1):**
   - This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_1 \) is calculated using the arctangent of the x and z coordinates.

2. **θ2 (Revolute 2):**
   - This joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle \( \theta_2 \) is calculated using the geometric relationship between the link lengths and the target position.
   - We check if the target position is reachable by ensuring \( |D| \leq 1 \). If not, we raise a `ValueError`.

3. **θ3 (Revolute 3):**
   - This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_3 \) is calculated using the geometric relationship between the link lengths and the target position.

This corrected implementation should handle the cases where the target position is not reachable and avoid the `ValueError` related to the square root of a negative number.
