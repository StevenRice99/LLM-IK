To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the forward kinematics result, we can see the position of the TCP when all joint angles are set to 0. The TCP position is at \( [0, 0.1753, 0.09465] \).

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the target position relative to the base frame:**
   The target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) is given in the base frame.

2. **Calculate the position of the end-effector relative to the base frame:**
   The end-effector position can be calculated using the forward kinematics equations.

3. **Solve for the joint angles:**
   We need to solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) that will position the end-effector at the target position.

Let's start by solving for \( \theta_1 \):

- **θ1 (Revolute 1):** This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_1 \) can be found using the arctangent of the x and z coordinates of the target position relative to the base frame.

Next, we solve for \( \theta_2 \):

- **θ2 (Revolute 2):** This joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle \( \theta_2 \) can be found using the arctangent of the y and z coordinates of the target position relative to the base frame.

Finally, we solve for \( \theta_3 \):

- **θ3 (Revolute 3):** This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_3 \) can be found using the arctangent of the x and y coordinates of the target position relative to the base frame.

Let's implement this step-by-step in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(y, z)
    
    # Solve for θ3 (Revolute 3)
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, y)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). The angles are computed using the arctangent function, which determines the angle based on the ratio of the coordinates of the target position.
