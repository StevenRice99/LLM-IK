The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics solver is not correctly calculating the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) to reach the target positions. The errors suggest that the transformation and angle calculations are incorrect. Let's rework the solution step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Solve for \(\theta_1\):**
   - The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \(\theta_1\) can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ plane and calculating the angle between the projection and the Z-axis.
   - Using the `atan2` function:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
     \]

2. **Transform the target position:**
   - After determining \(\theta_1\), we need to transform the target position into the coordinate system of the second joint. This involves rotating the target position by \(-\theta_1\) around the Y-axis and accounting for the offset of the second joint.
   - The transformed coordinates \((x', y', z')\) are:
     \[
     x' = x \cdot \cos(\theta_1) + z \cdot \sin(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     y' = y - 0.093
     \]
     \[
     z' = -x \cdot \sin(\theta_1) + z \cdot \cos(\theta_1)
     \]

3. **Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):**
   - The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Z-axis, and the third joint (Revolute 3) rotates around the Y-axis. We can treat this as a 2D planar manipulator in the XY plane.
   - The distance \(d\) from the second joint to the target position is:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{x'^2 + y'^2}
     \]
   - Using the law of cosines, we can solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(y', x') - \text{atan2}(0.0823, d)
     \]
     \[
     \theta_3 = \text{atan2}(0.0823, d)
     \]

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Transform the target position to the coordinate system of the second joint
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + z * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = y - 0.093
    z_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + z * math.cos(theta1)
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + y_prime**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_prime, x_prime) - math.atan2(0.0823, d)
    theta3 = math.atan2(0.0823, d)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
1. **\(\theta_1\) Calculation:**
   - The angle \(\theta_1\) is calculated using the `atan2` function to determine the rotation around the Y-axis.

2. **Transformation:**
   - The target position is transformed into the coordinate system of the second joint by rotating it by \(-\theta_1\) and accounting for the offset of the second joint.

3. **\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) Calculation:**
   - The angles \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) are calculated using the law of cosines and the `atan2` function to position the TCP correctly.

This solution should now correctly calculate the joint angles to reach the target positions.
