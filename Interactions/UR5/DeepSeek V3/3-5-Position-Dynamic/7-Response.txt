The error indicates that the value inside the square root is negative, which is not valid for real numbers. This suggests that the target position is not reachable or there is an issue with the calculation of \( D \). Let's re-examine the calculation of \( D \) and ensure that the target position is within the reachable workspace of the manipulator.

### Corrected Implementation

We need to ensure that the value inside the square root is non-negative. Additionally, we should handle cases where the target position is not reachable by checking the value of \( D \) before proceeding with the calculation.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.093
    L2 = 0.09465
    L3 = 0.0823
    
    # Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    D = (r**2 + y**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    
    # Check if the target position is reachable
    if abs(D) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach.")
    
    theta2 = math.atan2(-math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)
    
    # Solve for θ3 (Revolute 3)
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, r) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation

1. **θ1 (Revolute 1):**
   - This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_1 \) is calculated using the arctangent of the x and z coordinates.

2. **θ2 (Revolute 2):**
   - This joint rotates around the Z-axis. The angle \( \theta_2 \) is calculated using the geometric relationship between the link lengths and the target position.
   - We check if the target position is reachable by ensuring \( |D| \leq 1 \). If not, we raise a `ValueError`.

3. **θ3 (Revolute 3):**
   - This joint rotates around the Y-axis. The angle \( \theta_3 \) is calculated using the geometric relationship between the link lengths and the target position.

This corrected implementation should handle the cases where the target position is not reachable and avoid the `ValueError` related to the square root of a negative number.
