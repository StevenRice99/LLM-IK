The feedback indicates that the revised solution still fails to reach the target positions accurately. The main issue lies in the way \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) are calculated, particularly in the geometric relationships between the links and the target position. Let’s refine the solution further by carefully analyzing the manipulator’s geometry and ensuring the correct trigonometric relationships are used.

### Revised Solution:

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - The manipulator has 3 revolute joints:
     - Joint 1: Rotates around the Y-axis.
     - Joint 2: Rotates around the Z-axis.
     - Joint 3: Rotates around the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from Joint 3 by \([0, 0.0823, 0]\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The target position \(p = (x, y, z)\) must be transformed into a coordinate system relative to the manipulator’s base.
   - The solution must account for the lengths of Link 2 (\(0.093\)) and Link 3 (\(0.09465\)), as well as the TCP offset (\(0.0823\)).

3. **Step-by-Step Solution:**

   **Step 1: Solve for \(\theta_1\) (rotation around Y-axis):**
   - \(\theta_1\) is the angle in the XZ plane, calculated using `atan2(x, z)`.

   **Step 2: Transform the target position into the YZ plane:**
   - After applying \(\theta_1\), the problem reduces to a 2D planar manipulator in the YZ plane.
   - The target position in the YZ plane is:
     \[
     p_{yz} = (y, \sqrt{x^2 + z^2})
     \]

   **Step 3: Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\):**
   - The effective lengths in the YZ plane are:
     - Link 2: \(0.093\)
     - Link 3 + TCP offset: \(0.09465 + 0.0823 = 0.17695\)
   - Use the law of cosines to solve for \(\theta_3\):
     \[
     d = \sqrt{p_{yz}[0]^2 + p_{yz}[1]^2}
     \]
     \[
     \cos(\theta_3) = \frac{d^2 - (0.093)^2 - (0.17695)^2}{2 \cdot 0.093 \cdot 0.17695}
     \]
     \[
     \theta_3 = \pm \arccos(\cos(\theta_3))
     \]
   - Use the law of sines to solve for \(\theta_2\):
     \[
     \alpha = \arctan2(p_{yz}[0], p_{yz}[1])
     \]
     \[
     \beta = \arctan2(0.17695 \cdot \sin(\theta_3), 0.093 + 0.17695 \cdot \cos(\theta_3))
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \alpha - \beta
     \]

### Revised Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target position into the YZ plane
    distance_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    pyz = (py, distance_xz)
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    l2 = 0.093  # Length of Link 2
    l3 = 0.17695  # Length of Link 3 + TCP offset
    
    # Distance to the target in the YZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(pyz[0]**2 + pyz[1]**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable (d <= l2 + l3 and d >= |l2 - l3|)
    if not (abs(l2 - l3) <= d <= l2 + l3):
        raise ValueError("Target position is unreachable")
    
    # Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d^2 - l2^2 - l3^2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    alpha = math.atan2(pyz[0], pyz[1])
    beta = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **\(\theta_1\) Calculation:**
   - Unchanged, as it correctly computes the angle in the XZ plane.

2. **\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) Calculation:**
   - The target position is transformed into the YZ plane.
   - The law of cosines is used to compute \(\theta_3\).
   - The law of sines is used to compute \(\theta_2\), ensuring the correct geometric relationship.

3. **Reachability Check:**
   - Added a check to ensure the target position is within the manipulator’s workspace.

### Testing:
To verify the solution, you can call the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target positions provided in the feedback. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION -0.085160971497221 0.09431594708269701 -0.092074913613455
```

This will test the revised inverse kinematics solution and confirm its accuracy. If the solution still fails, further refinement of the geometric relationships may be necessary.
