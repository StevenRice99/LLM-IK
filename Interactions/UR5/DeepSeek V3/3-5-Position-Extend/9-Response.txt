The error occurs because the `^` operator in Python is the **bitwise XOR** operator, not the exponentiation operator. To fix this, we need to replace `^` with `**`, which is the correct operator for exponentiation in Python.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation around Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Step 2: Transform the target position into the YZ plane
    distance_xz = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    pyz = (py, distance_xz)
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    l2 = 0.093  # Length of Link 2
    l3 = 0.17695  # Length of Link 3 + TCP offset
    
    # Distance to the target in the YZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(pyz[0]**2 + pyz[1]**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable (d <= l2 + l3 and d >= |l2 - l3|)
    if not (abs(l2 - l3) <= d <= l2 + l3):
        raise ValueError("Target position is unreachable")
    
    # Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    alpha = math.atan2(pyz[0], pyz[1])
    beta = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Fixed Exponentiation Operator:**
   - Replaced `^` with `**` for exponentiation in the calculation of `cos_theta3`.

2. **No Other Changes:**
   - The rest of the code remains unchanged, as it correctly implements the inverse kinematics solution.

### Testing:
To verify the corrected solution, you can call the `TEST_SOLUTION` function with the target positions provided in the feedback. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION -0.085160971497221 0.09431594708269701 -0.092074913613455
```

This will test the corrected inverse kinematics solution and confirm its accuracy. If the solution still fails, further refinement of the geometric relationships may be necessary.
