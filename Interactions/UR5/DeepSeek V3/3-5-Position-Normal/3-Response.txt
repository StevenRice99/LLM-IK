The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution is incorrect. The joint values produced by the code do not match the correct joint values required to reach the target positions. Letâ€™s analyze the problem and derive a corrected solution.

### Step 1: Re-examining the Robot Structure
The robot has three revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
3. **Revolute 3**: Rotates around the Y-axis.

The positions of the links in local space are:
- Link 1: \([0, 0, 0]\)
- Link 2: \([0, 0.093, 0]\)
- Link 3: \([0, 0, 0.09465]\)
- TCP: \([0, 0.0823, 0]\)

---

### Step 2: Correct Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics of the robot can be expressed as:
\[
T = T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot T_{\text{TCP}}
\]
Where:
- \(T_1\) is the transformation matrix for Joint 1 (rotation around Y-axis).
- \(T_2\) is the transformation matrix for Joint 2 (rotation around Z-axis).
- \(T_3\) is the transformation matrix for Joint 3 (rotation around Y-axis).
- \(T_{\text{TCP}}\) is the transformation matrix for the TCP.

---

### Step 3: Correct Inverse Kinematics Derivation
To solve the inverse kinematics, we need to find the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) such that the TCP reaches the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

#### Step 3.1: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The second joint rotates around the Z-axis, which primarily affects the height \( y \) of the TCP. We can solve for \( \theta_2 \) using:
\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{y - l_{\text{TCP}}}{l_2 + l_3}\right)
\]
Where:
- \( l_2 = 0.093 \) (length of Link 2)
- \( l_3 = 0.09465 \) (length of Link 3)
- \( l_{\text{TCP}} = 0.0823 \) (length of TCP)

#### Step 3.2: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint rotates around the Y-axis, which primarily affects the \( x \) and \( z \) coordinates of the TCP. We can solve for \( \theta_1 \) using:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

#### Step 3.3: Solve for \( \theta_3 \)
The third joint rotates around the Y-axis, which adjusts the final position of the TCP. We can solve for \( \theta_3 \) using:
\[
\theta_3 = \arctan2\left(\frac{x - l_1 \cos(\theta_1)}{z - l_1 \sin(\theta_1)}\right)
\]

---

### Step 4: Implement the Corrected Solution
Here is the corrected implementation of the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Lengths of the links
    l1 = 0.093  # Length of Link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Length of Link 3
    l_tcp = 0.0823  # Length of TCP
    
    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = np.arcsin((y - l_tcp) / (l1 + l2))
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta3
    x_prime = x - l1 * np.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = z - l1 * np.sin(theta1)
    theta3 = np.arctan2(x_prime, z_prime)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

---

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To verify the solution, we can use the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to check if the computed joint angles position the TCP at the desired target position.

```python
TEST_SOLUTION x y z
```

This will return the position and orientation of all links in world space after testing the inverse kinematics solution. If the solution is correct, the TCP should reach the target position.
