The feedback indicates that the current inverse kinematics solution is still not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions and orientations. The issue lies in the way the joint angles are being calculated, particularly in how the dependencies between the joints are handled. To address this, we need to consider the full kinematic chain and solve the inverse kinematics more carefully.

### Revised Approach:

1. **Joint 1 (θ₁)**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the XZ plane is influenced by θ₁.
   - We can calculate θ₁ using the target position `(px, py, pz)` as:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(px, pz)
     \]

2. **Joint 2 (θ₂)**:
   - The second joint rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ₂.
   - After solving for θ₁, we can transform the target position into the coordinate frame of the second joint and calculate θ₂ as:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(py, \sqrt{px^2 + pz^2})
     \]

3. **Joint 3 (θ₃)**:
   - The third joint rotates around the Y-axis. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by θ₃.
   - After solving for θ₁ and θ₂, we can calculate θ₃ based on the target orientation `(rx, ry, rz)` as:
     \[
     \theta_3 = rz - \theta_1
     \]

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Solve for θ₁ (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Solve for θ₂ (Joint 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(py, math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2))
    
    # Solve for θ₃ (Joint 3)
    theta3 = rz - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:

1. **θ₁**:
   - Calculated using `atan2(px, pz)` to align the TCP with the target position in the XZ plane.

2. **θ₂**:
   - Calculated using `atan2(py, sqrt(px^2 + pz^2))` to align the TCP with the target position in the XY plane, after accounting for the rotation of θ₁.

3. **θ₃**:
   - Calculated as `rz - theta1` to align the TCP with the target orientation, after accounting for the rotation of θ₁.

### Next Steps:

If this solution still fails to reach the target, we can call the `TEST_SOLUTION` function to debug the results further. For example:

```
TEST_SOLUTION px py pz rx ry rz
```

This will allow us to verify the position and orientation of the TCP after applying the calculated joint angles and refine the solution if necessary.
