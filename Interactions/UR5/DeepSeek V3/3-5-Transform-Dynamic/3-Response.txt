The feedback indicates that the initial inverse kinematics solution is incorrect. The problem lies in the way the joint angles are calculated. Specifically, the current approach does not account for the chain of transformations and the dependencies between the joints. To solve this, we need to consider the forward kinematics of the manipulator and derive the inverse kinematics step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics of the manipulator can be described as follows:

1. **Revolute 1 (θ₁)**: Rotates around the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2 (θ₂)**: Rotates around the Z-axis.
3. **Revolute 3 (θ₃)**: Rotates around the Y-axis.

The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be derived by applying these transformations sequentially.

#### Step 2: Inverse Kinematics
To solve the inverse kinematics, we need to find the joint angles (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃) that position the TCP at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`.

1. **Solve for θ₁**:
   - The first joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the XZ plane is influenced by θ₁.
   - We can use `atan2(px, pz)` to find θ₁.

2. **Solve for θ₂**:
   - The second joint rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by θ₂.
   - We can use `atan2(py, sqrt(px² + pz²))` to find θ₂.

3. **Solve for θ₃**:
   - The third joint rotates around the Y-axis. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by θ₃.
   - We can use the desired orientation `r` to find θ₃.

### Final Code
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Solve for theta1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (Joint 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(py, math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2))
    
    # Solve for theta3 (Joint 3)
    theta3 = rz - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation
- **θ₁**: This angle is determined by the position of the TCP in the XZ plane. We use `atan2(px, pz)` to find the angle.
- **θ₂**: This angle is determined by the position of the TCP in the XY plane. We use `atan2(py, sqrt(px² + pz²))` to find the angle.
- **θ₃**: This angle is determined by the desired orientation `r`. We use `rz - theta1` to find the angle.

This solution should correctly position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.
