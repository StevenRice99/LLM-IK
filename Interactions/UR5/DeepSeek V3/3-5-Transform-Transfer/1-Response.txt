To solve the inverse kinematics problem for both position and orientation, we need to extend the existing solution to account for the desired orientation of the TCP. The existing solution only solves for the position. We will use the orientation to determine the third joint angle.

Given the orientation `r` in the form of roll, pitch, and yaw angles, we can use the yaw angle to determine the third joint angle. The yaw angle corresponds to the rotation around the Z-axis, which is the axis of the third joint.

Here's the completed `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r
    
    # Constants
    A = 0.09465
    B = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate θ2
    cosθ2 = (y - 0.093) / B
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    sinθ2 = math.sin(θ2)
    
    # Calculate θ1
    M = [[A, -B * sinθ2], [B * sinθ2, A]]
    det_M = M[0][0] * M[1][1] - M[0][1] * M[1][0]
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * M[1][1], -inv_det_M * M[0][1]], [-inv_det_M * M[1][0], inv_det_M * M[0][0]]]
    sinθ1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z
    cosθ1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)
    
    # Calculate θ3 using the yaw angle
    θ3 = yaw
    
    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

This function first calculates the joint angles θ1 and θ2 to reach the desired position, similar to the existing solution. Then, it uses the yaw angle from the orientation to determine the third joint angle θ3. This approach assumes that the yaw angle directly corresponds to the rotation around the Z-axis of the third joint, which is a reasonable assumption given the provided URDF details.
