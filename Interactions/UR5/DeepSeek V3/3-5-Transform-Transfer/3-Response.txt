The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly handling the orientation part of the problem. Specifically, the third joint angle (θ3) is being set directly to the yaw angle, which is not sufficient to achieve the desired orientation in all cases. 

To address this, we need to consider the full orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) and how it affects all three joint angles. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by all three joints, not just the third one. Therefore, we need to adjust our approach to account for the combined effect of all joints on the orientation.

Here's a revised approach:

1. **Calculate θ1 and θ2 for Position**: Use the existing method to calculate θ1 and θ2 based on the desired position (x, y, z).

2. **Calculate θ3 for Orientation**: Instead of directly setting θ3 to the yaw angle, we need to consider the desired orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) and how it relates to the joint angles. This involves solving for θ3 such that the combined effect of θ1, θ2, and θ3 results in the desired orientation.

To implement this, we can use the forward kinematics to compute the orientation of the TCP given the joint angles and then adjust θ3 to match the desired orientation. This involves an iterative approach or solving a system of equations that relates the joint angles to the orientation.

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function accordingly:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:

    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Calculate θ2
    cosθ2 = (y - 0.093) / B
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    sinθ2 = math.sin(θ2)
    
    # Calculate θ1
    M = [[A, -B * sinθ2], [B * sinθ2, A]]
    det_M = M[0][0] * M[1][1] - M[0][1] * M[1][0]
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * M[1][1], -inv_det_M * M[0][1]], [-inv_det_M * M[1][0], inv_det_M * M[0][0]]]
    sinθ1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z
    cosθ1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)
    
    # Calculate θ3 using the desired orientation
    # We need to solve for θ3 such that the combined effect of θ1, θ2, and θ3 results in the desired orientation
    # This involves using the forward kinematics to compute the orientation and then adjusting θ3
    # For simplicity, we'll use an iterative approach to find θ3
    def forward_kinematics(θ1, θ2, θ3):
        # Compute the transformation matrix for each joint
        # Joint 1: Rotation around Y axis by θ1
        T1 = np.array([
            [math.cos(θ1), 0, math.sin(θ1), 0],
            [0, 1, 0, 0],
            [-math.sin(θ1), 0, math.cos(θ1), 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 1]
        ])
        # Joint 2: Translation along Y by 0.093, then rotation around Z by θ2
        T2 = np.array([
            [math.cos(θ2), -math.sin(θ2), 0, 0],
            [math.sin(θ2), math.cos(θ2), 0, 0.093],

        ])
        # TCP: Translation along Y by 0.0823, then rotation around Z by 1.570796325
        T_tcp = np.array([
            [0, -1, 0, 0],
            [1, 0, 0, 0.0823],
            [0, 0, 1, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 1]
        ])

        pitch = math.atan2(-T[2, 0], math.sqrt(T[2, 1]**2 + T[2, 2]**2))
        yaw = math.atan2(T[1, 0], T[0, 0])
        return roll, pitch, yaw
    
    # Iterative approach to find θ3
    θ3 = yaw  # Initial guess
    tolerance = 1e-6
    max_iterations = 100
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        current_roll, current_pitch, current_yaw = forward_kinematics(θ1, θ2, θ3)
        error_roll = roll - current_roll
        error_pitch = pitch - current_pitch
        error_yaw = yaw - current_yaw
        if abs(error_roll) < tolerance and abs(error_pitch) < tolerance and abs(error_yaw) < tolerance:
            break
        # Adjust θ3 based on the error
        θ3 += 0.1 * error_yaw  # Simple proportional control
    
    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

This revised function uses an iterative approach to adjust θ3 based on the error between the desired and current orientation. The `forward_kinematics` function computes the orientation of the TCP given the joint angles, and the main function iteratively adjusts θ3 to minimize the orientation error.

This approach should provide a more accurate solution for both position and orientation.
