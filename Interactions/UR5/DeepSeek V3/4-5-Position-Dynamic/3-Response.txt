To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the forward kinematics result, we can see that the TCP position is influenced by both joint1 and joint2. The position of the TCP is given by:

\[
\text{TCP} = [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
\]

This indicates that the TCP is offset in the Y and Z directions due to the lengths of the links.

To find the joint angles, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate joint1 (θ1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the second joint (Revolute 2) is influenced by this rotation.
   - We can use the atan2 function to find the angle between the X and Y coordinates of the target position.

2. **Calculate joint2 (θ2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP is influenced by this rotation.
   - We can use the atan2 function to find the angle between the X and Z coordinates of the target position.

Let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (θ1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (θ2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of the second joint
    x_adj = x - 0.0823 * math.sin(theta1)
    z_adj = z - 0.09465
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_adj, x_adj)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1 (joint1):** This is calculated using the `atan2` function with the Y and X coordinates of the target position. This gives the angle needed to align the first joint with the target position in the XY plane.
- **theta2 (joint2):** This is calculated using the `atan2` function with the adjusted Z and X coordinates of the target position. The adjustment accounts for the offset introduced by the second joint.

This function will return the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired target position.
