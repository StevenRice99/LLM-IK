To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the forward kinematics results, we can see that the TCP position is influenced by both joint1 and joint2. The position of the TCP is given by:

\[
\text{TCP} = [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
\]

This indicates that the TCP is offset in the Y and Z directions relative to the base frame.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Target Position:**
   Let the target position be \( p = (x, y, z) \).

2. **Calculate Joint1 (θ1):**
   The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ1 can be calculated using the atan2 function to determine the angle between the X and Y coordinates of the target position.

   \[
   \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
   \]

3. **Calculate Joint2 (θ2):**
   The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ2 can be calculated using the atan2 function to determine the angle between the Z coordinate and the distance in the X-Y plane.

   \[
   \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(z - 0.09465, \sqrt{x^2 + y^2})
   \]

4. **Return the Joint Angles:**
   The function should return the calculated joint angles θ1 and θ2.

### Python Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (θ1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (θ2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(z - 0.09465, math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:

- **θ1 (Joint1):** This angle is calculated using the atan2 function to determine the angle between the X and Y coordinates of the target position. This will align the first link in the direction of the target position in the X-Y plane.
  
- **θ2 (Joint2):** This angle is calculated using the atan2 function to determine the angle between the Z coordinate (adjusted for the offset) and the distance in the X-Y plane. This will adjust the second link to reach the desired Z coordinate.

This function will return the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired target position.
