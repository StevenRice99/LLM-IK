Based on the feedback, it appears that the initial solution for the inverse kinematics is incorrect. The main issue is that the calculation for θ2 is not correctly accounting for the geometry of the manipulator. Let's re-evaluate the problem and derive the correct inverse kinematics solution.

### Re-evaluated Solution:

1. **Identify the Target Position:**
   Let the target position be \( p = (x, y, z) \).

2. **Calculate Joint1 (θ1):**
   The first joint (Revolute 1) rotates around the Z-axis. The angle θ1 can be calculated using the atan2 function to determine the angle between the X and Y coordinates of the target position.

   \[
   \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
   \]

3. **Calculate Joint2 (θ2):**
   The second joint (Revolute 2) rotates around the Y-axis. The angle θ2 should be calculated based on the distance in the X-Y plane and the Z coordinate, considering the offset.

   Given the forward kinematics, the TCP position is influenced by both joints. The correct approach is to consider the geometry of the manipulator and solve for θ2 accordingly.

   \[
   \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(z - 0.09465, \sqrt{x^2 + y^2})
   \]

4. **Adjust θ1 and θ2:**
   The feedback indicates that the initial solution does not correctly position the TCP. Therefore, we need to adjust the calculation of θ1 and θ2 to ensure the correct positioning.

### Corrected Python Function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (θ1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (θ2)
    # Adjust for the offset in the Z direction
    z_offset = z - 0.09465
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_offset, math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:

- **θ1 (Joint1):** This angle is calculated using the atan2 function to determine the angle between the X and Y coordinates of the target position. This will align the first link in the direction of the target position in the X-Y plane.
  
- **θ2 (Joint2):** This angle is calculated using the atan2 function to determine the angle between the adjusted Z coordinate (considering the offset) and the distance in the X-Y plane. This will adjust the second link to reach the desired Z coordinate.

This corrected function should now correctly position the TCP at the desired target position.
