The feedback indicates that the revised implementation still fails to reach the target positions correctly. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of `theta2`, which is not correctly accounting for the geometric relationships between the joints and the target position.

Let's re-examine the problem and adjust the approach:

1. **Calculate joint1 (θ1):**
   - The first joint rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the second joint (Revolute 2) is influenced by this rotation.
   - We can use the `atan2` function to find the angle between the X and Y coordinates of the target position.

2. **Calculate joint2 (θ2):**
   - The second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP is influenced by this rotation.
   - We need to consider the geometric relationship between the target position and the second joint's position.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate joint1 (θ1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate joint2 (θ2)
    # The second joint is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the first joint
    # The TCP is at [0, 0.0823, 0] relative to the second joint
    # The target position in the coordinate system of the second joint
    x_adj = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    z_adj = z - 0.09465
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_adj, x_adj)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1 (joint1):** This is calculated using the `atan2` function with the Y and X coordinates of the target position. This gives the angle needed to align the first joint with the target position in the XY plane.
- **theta2 (joint2):** This is calculated using the `atan2` function with the adjusted Z and X coordinates of the target position. The adjustment accounts for the offset introduced by the second joint.

This corrected function should now correctly calculate the joint angles needed to position the TCP at the desired target position.
