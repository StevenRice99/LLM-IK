To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired coordinates \((x, y, z)\).

Given the forward kinematics result, we can see how the TCP position changes with the joint angles. The TCP position is influenced by both \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). 

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the position of the end of the first link (Revolute 1):**
   - The first link rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the end of the first link can be determined using the rotation matrix for the Z-axis.
   - The position of the end of the first link is given by:
     \[
     \mathbf{p}_1 = \begin{bmatrix}
     l_1 \cos(\theta_1) \\
     l_1 \sin(\theta_1) \\
     0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - However, in this case, the length of the first link \(l_1\) is 0, so the position of the end of the first link is at the origin.

2. **Determine the position of the end of the second link (Revolute 2):**
   - The second link rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the end of the second link relative to the first link is given by:
     \[
     \mathbf{p}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 \\
     0 \\
     l_2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The length of the second link \(l_2\) is 0.09465 meters.

3. **Determine the position of the TCP:**
   - The TCP is offset from the end of the second link by \([0, 0.0823, 0]\).
   - The position of the TCP relative to the base frame is given by:
     \[
     \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}} = \mathbf{p}_1 + R_1 (\mathbf{p}_2 + R_2 \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP offset}})
     \]
   - Where \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are the rotation matrices for the first and second joints, respectively.

4. **Solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\):**
   - We need to solve the system of equations derived from the position of the TCP.
   - The equations are:
     \[
     x = l_2 \cos(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) + 0.0823 \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     y = l_2 \sin(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) + 0.0823 \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z = l_2 \cos(\theta_2) - 0.0823 \sin(\theta_2)
     \]

5. **Implement the solution in Python:**
   - We will use the `atan2` function to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

Here is the completed `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    l2 = 0.09465
    l_tcp = 0.0823
    
    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(z, math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 - l_tcp**2))
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) required to position the TCP at the desired coordinates \((x, y, z)\). The function uses the `atan2` function to handle the quadrant correctly and ensures that the solution is within the joint limits.
