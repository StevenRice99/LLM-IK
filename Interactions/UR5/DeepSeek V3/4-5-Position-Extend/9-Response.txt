The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly calculating the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) to reach the desired TCP positions. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of \(\theta_2\), which is consistently resulting in a value close to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) (1.5707963267948966 radians), which is not correct for the given target positions.

Let's re-examine the problem and adjust the solution accordingly.

### Revised Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the position of the end of the first link (Revolute 1):**
   - The first link rotates around the Z-axis. The position of the end of the first link is at the origin.

2. **Determine the position of the end of the second link (Revolute 2):**
   - The second link rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the end of the second link relative to the first link is given by:
     \[
     \mathbf{p}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 \\
     0 \\
     l_2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The length of the second link \(l_2\) is 0.09465 meters.

3. **Determine the position of the TCP:**
   - The TCP is offset from the end of the second link by \([0, 0.0823, 0]\).
   - The position of the TCP relative to the base frame is given by:
     \[
     \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP}} = \mathbf{p}_1 + R_1 (\mathbf{p}_2 + R_2 \mathbf{p}_{\text{TCP offset}})
     \]
   - Where \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) are the rotation matrices for the first and second joints, respectively.

4. **Solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\):**
   - We need to solve the system of equations derived from the position of the TCP.
   - The equations are:
     \[
     x = l_2 \cos(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) + 0.0823 \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     y = l_2 \sin(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) + 0.0823 \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z = l_2 \cos(\theta_2) - 0.0823 \sin(\theta_2)
     \]

5. **Implement the revised solution in Python:**
   - We will use the `atan2` function to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
   - We will ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative.

Here is the revised `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    l2 = 0.09465
    l_tcp = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate the distance from the origin to the projection of the TCP on the XY plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    # Using the law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 + z**2 - l2**2 - l_tcp**2) / (2 * l2 * l_tcp)
    # Ensure the value is within the valid range for acos
    cos_theta2 = max(min(cos_theta2, 1), -1)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This revised function calculates the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) required to position the TCP at the desired coordinates \((x, y, z)\). The function ensures that the expression inside the `acos` function is within the valid range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid domain errors.
