To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 rotates around the Z-axis.
- Revolute 2 rotates around the Y-axis.
- The length of the second link (from Revolute 2 to TCP) is 0.0823 meters.
- The offset between Revolute 1 and Revolute 2 is 0.09465 meters along the Z-axis.

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) meters (distance along Z-axis between Revolute 1 and Revolute 2).
- \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) meters (distance along Y-axis between Revolute 2 and TCP).

The position of the TCP can be described by the following equations based on the forward kinematics:

\[
x = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y = L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
z = L_1 + L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)
\]

Where:
- \( \theta_1 \) is the angle of Revolute 1 (joint1).
- \( \theta_2 \) is the angle of Revolute 2 (joint2).

To find \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we can solve these equations.

First, let's solve for \( \theta_2 \):

From the equation for \( z \):
\[
z = L_1 + L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)
\]
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{z - L_1}{L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{z - L_1}{L_2}\right)
\]

Next, solve for \( \theta_1 \):

From the equations for \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
x = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y = L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]

We can divide the second equation by the first to eliminate \( L_2 \) and \( \sin(\theta_2) \):
\[
\frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\cos(\theta_1)} = \tan(\theta_1)
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

Now, let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate theta2
    cos_theta2 = (z - L1) / L2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p \).
