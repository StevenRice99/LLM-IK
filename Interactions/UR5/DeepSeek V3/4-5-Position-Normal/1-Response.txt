To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (joint1 and joint2) that will position the TCP at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

Given the details:
- Revolute 1 rotates around the Z-axis.
- Revolute 2 rotates around the Y-axis.
- The length of the first link (from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2) is 0.09465 meters.
- The length of the second link (from Revolute 2 to TCP) is 0.0823 meters.

Let's denote:
- \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) meters (length of the first link).
- \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) meters (length of the second link).
- \( \theta_1 \) as the angle for Revolute 1.
- \( \theta_2 \) as the angle for Revolute 2.

The position of the TCP can be derived using the forward kinematics equations:
\[
x = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
y = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
z = 0
\]

Given that \( z = 0 \), we can ignore the z-coordinate for this 2D problem.

To find \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the distance \( d \) from the origin to the target point \( (x, y) \):
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

2. Use the Law of Cosines to find \( \theta_2 \):
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)
\]

3. Use the Law of Sines to find \( \theta_1 \):
\[
\sin(\theta_1) = \frac{L_2 \sin(\theta_2)}{d}
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x) - \arctan2(L_2 \sin(\theta_2), L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2))
\]

Now, let's implement this in the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    alpha = math.atan2(y, x)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p \).
