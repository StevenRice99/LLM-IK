Given the feedback, it appears that the initial approach to solving the inverse kinematics is still incorrect. The main issue is that the solution does not account for the correct orientation of the TCP, which is fixed at \( [0, 0, 1.570796325] \) radians (90 degrees) around the Z-axis. This means that the TCP is always oriented perpendicular to the plane formed by the two revolute joints.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the inverse kinematics, we need to consider the fixed orientation of the TCP. The correct approach is to recognize that the second joint (Revolute 2) does not contribute to the orientation change, and thus \( \theta_2 \) should be set to 0. The first joint (Revolute 1) should be set to the angle that aligns the TCP with the desired position.

Given this, the correct inverse kinematics solution should be:

1. Calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

2. Set \( \theta_2 \) to 0, as the second joint does not contribute to the orientation change.

### Implementing the Corrected Inverse Kinematics Solution

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function accordingly:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Set theta2 to 0 (fixed orientation)
    theta2 = 0.0
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Conclusion
