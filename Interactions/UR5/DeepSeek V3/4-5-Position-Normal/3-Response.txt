The error occurs because the argument to `math.acos` must be within the range \([-1, 1]\). If the input \( z \) is outside the range \([-L_2, L_2]\), the division \( z / L_2 \) will result in a value outside \([-1, 1]\), causing a domain error.

Given that the problem states all targets are reachable, we can assume that the input \( z \) is within the valid range. However, to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies, we can clamp the value to the valid range before passing it to `math.acos`.

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function to include this safeguard:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    # Clamp z / L2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors
    z_over_L2 = z / L2
    z_over_L2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, z_over_L2))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(z_over_L2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    theta1 = math.atan2((y - L1) / (L2 * sin_theta2), x / (L2 * sin_theta2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function ensures that the argument to `math.acos` is within the valid range, preventing the domain error.
