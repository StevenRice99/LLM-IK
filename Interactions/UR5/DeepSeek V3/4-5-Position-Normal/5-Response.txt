The error occurs because `sin_theta2` can be zero, leading to a division by zero when calculating `theta1`. This happens when `theta2` is either 0 or \(\pi\), making \(\sin(\theta_2) = 0\).

To handle this, we need to ensure that `sin_theta2` is not zero before performing the division. Given that the problem states all targets are reachable, we can assume that `sin_theta2` will not be zero for valid inputs. However, to handle potential edge cases, we can add a small epsilon value to avoid division by zero.

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function to include this safeguard:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    epsilon = 1e-10  # Small epsilon to avoid division by zero
    
    # Clamp z / L2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid domain errors
    z_over_L2 = z / L2
    z_over_L2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, z_over_L2))
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(z_over_L2)
    
    # Calculate sin_theta2 and add epsilon to avoid division by zero
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    if abs(sin_theta2) < epsilon:
        sin_theta2 = epsilon if sin_theta2 >= 0 else -epsilon
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2((y - L1) / (L2 * sin_theta2), x / (L2 * sin_theta2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function ensures that `sin_theta2` is not zero by adding a small epsilon value, preventing the division by zero error.
