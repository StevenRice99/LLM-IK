The feedback indicates that the updated `inverse_kinematics` function is still not producing the correct joint angles. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of \( \theta_1 \). The function is calculating \( \theta_1 \) as the arctangent of \( y \) and \( x \), but this does not account for the geometry of the manipulator.

Let's re-examine the problem:

1. The manipulator has two links: the first link of length \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) meters and the second link of length \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) meters.
2. The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is consistently 0 in the correct solutions, which means the second link is always aligned with the first link.
3. The position of the end-effector is determined solely by \( \theta_1 \).

Given that \( \theta_2 = 0 \), the position of the end-effector can be calculated as:
\[
x = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z = 0
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
x = (L_1 + L_2) \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = (L_1 + L_2) \sin(\theta_1)
\]

Therefore, \( \theta_1 \) can be calculated as:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

However, the feedback shows that this approach is not correct. Let's consider the possibility that the second link is not aligned with the first link, and \( \theta_2 \) is not necessarily 0.

Let's try a different approach:

1. Calculate the distance \( d \) from the origin to the target point \( (x, y) \):
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

2. Check if the target is reachable:
\[
\text{If } d > L_1 + L_2 \text{ or } d < |L_1 - L_2|, \text{ the target is not reachable.}
\]

3. Calculate \( \theta_2 \) using the Law of Cosines:
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}\right)
\]

4. Calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the Law of Sines:
\[
\sin(\theta_1) = \frac{L_2 \sin(\theta_2)}{d}
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x) - \arctan2(L_2 \sin(\theta_2), L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2))
\]

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function accordingly:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > L1 + L2 or d < abs(L1 - L2):
        raise ValueError("Target position is not reachable.")
    
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    alpha = math.atan2(y, x)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function calculates \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines, which should provide the correct joint angles to reach the desired position.
