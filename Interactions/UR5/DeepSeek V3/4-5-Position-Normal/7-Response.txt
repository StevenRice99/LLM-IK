The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not producing the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of `theta1`. Let's re-examine the approach and correct the calculations.

Given the forward kinematics equations:
\[
x = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y = L_1 + L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
z = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)
\]

We need to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

1. **Calculate \(\theta_2\)**:
\[
z = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2) \implies \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{z}{L_2}\right)
\]

2. **Calculate \(\theta_1\)**:
From the x and y equations:
\[
x = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y - L_1 = L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]

We can divide the two equations to eliminate \(L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_2)\):
\[
\frac{y - L_1}{x} = \frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\cos(\theta_1)} = \tan(\theta_1)
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y - L_1, x)
\]

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function accordingly:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate theta2
    z_over_L2 = z / L2
    z_over_L2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, z_over_L2))
    theta2 = math.acos(z_over_L2)
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y - L1, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function correctly calculates \(\theta_1\) using the `atan2` function, which takes into account the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant of the angle. This should resolve the issues with reaching the target positions.
