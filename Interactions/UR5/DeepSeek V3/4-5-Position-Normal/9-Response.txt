The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is still not producing the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The main issue seems to be with the calculation of \(\theta_1\). Let's re-examine the approach and correct the calculations.

Given the forward kinematics equations:
\[
x = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y = L_1 + L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
z = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)
\]

We need to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

1. **Calculate \(\theta_2\)**:
\[
z = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2) \implies \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{z}{L_2}\right)
\]

2. **Calculate \(\theta_1\)**:
From the x and y equations:
\[
x = L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y - L_1 = L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_1) \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
\]

We can divide the two equations to eliminate \(L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_2)\):
\[
\frac{y - L_1}{x} = \frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\cos(\theta_1)} = \tan(\theta_1)
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y - L_1, x)
\]

However, the feedback shows that this approach is not working correctly. Let's consider the possibility that the target positions are in a different coordinate system or that the joint limits need to be considered.

Given that the feedback shows that the correct joint values for some positions are \(\theta_2 = 0\), it suggests that the target positions are such that the second link is aligned with the Z-axis. In this case, \(\theta_2 = 0\) and \(\theta_1\) should be calculated based on the x and y coordinates.

Let's update the `inverse_kinematics` function to handle this case:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate theta2
    z_over_L2 = z / L2
    z_over_L2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, z_over_L2))
    theta2 = math.acos(z_over_L2)
    
    # Handle the case when theta2 is 0 or pi
    if abs(theta2) < 1e-10 or abs(theta2 - math.pi) < 1e-10:
        theta1 = math.atan2(y - L1, x)
    else:
        # Calculate theta1
        sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
        theta1 = math.atan2((y - L1) / (L2 * sin_theta2), x / (L2 * sin_theta2))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function handles the case when \(\theta_2\) is 0 or \(\pi\) separately, ensuring that \(\theta_1\) is calculated correctly in these edge cases. This should resolve the issues with reaching the target positions.
