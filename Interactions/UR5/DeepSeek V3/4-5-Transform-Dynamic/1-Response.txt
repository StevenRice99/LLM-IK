To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\) with the desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\).

### Step 1: Solve for \(\theta_1\)
The first joint is a revolute joint around the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY plane is influenced by \(\theta_1\). We can use the `inverse_kinematics` function from **EXISTING 1** to solve for \(\theta_1\):

\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(\theta_2\)
The second joint is a revolute joint around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the XZ plane is influenced by \(\theta_2\). We can use the `inverse_kinematics` function from **EXISTING 2** to solve for \(\theta_2\):

\[
\theta_2 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Solutions
We need to combine the solutions for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) to reach the desired position and orientation. The orientation \(r\) is given in radians, and since the TCP's orientation is fixed relative to the last link, we can directly use the orientation to determine the final joint angles.

### Final Solution
The final solution involves calculating \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) using the provided functions and then returning them as a tuple.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the first joint (Z-axis rotation)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the second joint (Y-axis rotation)
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1**: This is the angle of the first joint, which rotates around the Z-axis. It is calculated using the `atan2` function with the y and x coordinates of the target position.
- **theta2**: This is the angle of the second joint, which rotates around the Y-axis. It is calculated using the `atan2` function with the x and z coordinates of the target position.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable, and it directly computes the joint angles needed to achieve the desired TCP position and orientation.
