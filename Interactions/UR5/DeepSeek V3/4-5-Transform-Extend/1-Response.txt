To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) that will position the TCP at the desired position \(p = [x, y, z]\) with the desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Position Analysis:**
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by both \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
   - The position of the TCP in the world frame can be expressed as:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     x &= L_2 \cos(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) \\
     y &= L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) \\
     z &= L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
     \end{aligned}
     \]
     where \(L_1 = 0.09465\) and \(L_2 = 0.0823\).

2. **Orientation Analysis:**
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
   - The desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\) can be used to determine the required joint angles.

3. **Solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\):**
   - From the position equations, we can solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\):
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}\left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, z - L_1\right)
     \]

4. **Implementing the Solution:**
   - We will use the `math.atan2` function to compute the angles.

### Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2), z - L1)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1** is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in the XY plane.
- **theta2** is calculated using `math.atan2(math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2), z - L1)`, which gives the angle in the Z direction relative to the first link.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable, and it directly computes the joint angles required to achieve the desired TCP position and orientation.
