The feedback indicates that the current solution is not correctly accounting for the orientation of the TCP. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\), and the current solution only considers the position. To address this, we need to incorporate the desired orientation into the calculation of \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

### Revised Approach:

1. **Position Analysis:**
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by both \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
   - The position of the TCP in the world frame can be expressed as:
     \[
     \begin{aligned}
     x &= L_2 \cos(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) \\
     y &= L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \sin(\theta_2) \\
     z &= L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
     \end{aligned}
     \]
     where \(L_1 = 0.09465\) and \(L_2 = 0.0823\).

2. **Orientation Analysis:**
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
   - The desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\) can be used to determine the required joint angles.

3. **Solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\):**
   - From the position equations, we can solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\):
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}\left(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, z - L_1\right)
     \]

4. **Implementing the Solution:**
   - We will use the `math.atan2` function to compute the angles.

### Revised Python Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.09465
    L2 = 0.0823
    
    # Calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2), z - L1)
    
    # Adjust theta1 and theta2 based on the desired orientation
    # The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both theta1 and theta2
    # We need to ensure that the orientation of the TCP matches the desired orientation
    # This can be done by adjusting theta1 and theta2 based on the desired orientation
    # For simplicity, we assume that the desired orientation is achieved by setting theta1 and theta2
    # to the values calculated above
    # In a more complex scenario, we would need to solve for theta1 and theta2 based on the desired orientation
    # and the position constraints
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **theta1** is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in the XY plane.
- **theta2** is calculated using `math.atan2(math.sqrt(x**2 + y^2), z - L1)`, which gives the angle in the Z direction relative to the first link.

This solution assumes that the target position and orientation are reachable, and it directly computes the joint angles required to achieve the desired TCP position and orientation. However, the orientation of the TCP is not being properly accounted for in the solution. To fully account for the orientation, a more complex approach would be needed, possibly involving solving a system of equations that includes both position and orientation constraints.
