The error occurs because the code contains invalid characters (specifically, the subscript '₂' in the variable name `θ₂`). In Python, variable names must consist of valid Unicode characters, and subscripts are not allowed in variable names. We need to replace the subscript characters with regular characters.

Here’s the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the z position equation
    z_offset = z - 0.09465
    theta2 = np.arcsin(-z_offset / 0.0823)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the x and y position equations
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. Replaced `θ₂` with `theta2` and `θ₁` with `theta1` to use valid variable names.
2. The logic remains the same:
   - `theta2` is calculated using the z position equation.
   - `theta1` is calculated using the `arctan2` function based on the x and y positions.

This should resolve the error and allow the code to run correctly.
