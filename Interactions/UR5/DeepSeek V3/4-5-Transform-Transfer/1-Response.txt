To solve the inverse kinematics problem for both position and orientation, we need to consider the following:

1. **Position**: The position of the TCP is influenced by the two revolute joints. The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, and the second joint rotates around the Y-axis. The position of the TCP can be derived using the forward kinematics equations.

2. **Orientation**: The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the rotations of the two revolute joints. The final orientation of the TCP is the cumulative effect of the rotations of both joints.

Given the details, the TCP's position and orientation can be expressed as follows:

### Position:
The position of the TCP in world coordinates can be derived using the following equations:

- The first joint rotates around the Z-axis, so the position after the first joint is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 \\
  y_1 \\
  z_1
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos(\theta_1) & -\sin(\theta_1) & 0 \\
  \sin(\theta_1) & \cos(\theta_1) & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- The second joint rotates around the Y-axis, so the position after the second joint is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x_2 \\
  y_2 \\
  z_2
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \cos(\theta_2) & 0 & \sin(\theta_2) \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  -\sin(\theta_2) & 0 & \cos(\theta_2)
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0 \\
  0.09465
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.09465 \sin(\theta_2) \\
  0 \\
  0.09465 \cos(\theta_2)
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

- The TCP's position relative to the second joint is:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x_{TCP} \\
  y_{TCP} \\
  z_{TCP}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\
  0.0823 \\
  0
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

Thus, the final position of the TCP in world coordinates is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0.09465 \sin(\theta_2) \\
0.0823 \\
0.09465 \cos(\theta_2)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Orientation:
The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the rotations of both joints. The final orientation can be derived by multiplying the rotation matrices of both joints:

\[
R_{TCP} = R_{Z}(\theta_1) \cdot R_{Y}(\theta_2) \cdot R_{TCP\_local}
\]

Where \( R_{TCP\_local} \) is the local orientation of the TCP, which is a rotation of \( 1.570796325 \) radians around the Z-axis.

### Inverse Kinematics Solution:
Given the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \), we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \):

1. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   From the position equations:
   \[
   x = 0.09465 \sin(\theta_2) \\
   z = 0.09465 \cos(\theta_2)
   \]
   We can solve for \( \theta_2 \) using:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
   \]

2. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**:
   From the orientation equations, we can derive \( \theta_1 \) based on the target orientation \( r \).

### Python Implementation:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Solve for theta2 using position
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using orientation
    # The final orientation is influenced by both theta1 and theta2
    # We can derive theta1 from the target orientation r_z
    theta1 = r_z - 1.570796325  # Subtract the local TCP orientation
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution assumes that the target orientation \( r_z \) is directly influenced by \( \theta_1 \) and the local TCP orientation. The final orientation is adjusted by subtracting the local TCP orientation to solve for \( \theta_1 \).
