The user wants to implement the inverse kinematics for a 1-DOF serial manipulator.
The manipulator has two links: Revolute 1 and TCP.
Revolute 1 rotates around the Y axis.
The position of Revolute 1 in its parent frame (world frame) is [0, 0, 0].
The orientation of Revolute 1 in its parent frame (world frame) is [0, 0, 0].
The position of TCP in Revolute 1 frame is [0, 0, 0.39225].
The orientation of TCP in Revolute 1 frame is [0, 0, 0].

Let's denote the joint variable as `theta`.
The rotation matrix for Revolute 1 around the Y axis is:
R_y(theta) = [[cos(theta), 0, sin(theta)],
             [0,         1, 0        ],
             [-sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)]]

The position of Revolute 1 in world frame is P_1 = [0, 0, 0].
The position of TCP in Revolute 1 frame is P_TCP_local = [0, 0, 0.39225].

The position of TCP in world frame (P_TCP_world) can be calculated using forward kinematics:
P_TCP_world = R_y(theta) * P_TCP_local + P_1
Since P_1 = [0, 0, 0], we have:
P_TCP_world = R_y(theta) * P_TCP_local

P_TCP_world = [[cos(theta), 0, sin(theta)],
             [0,         1, 0        ],
             [-sin(theta), 0, cos(theta)]] * [0, 0, 0.39225]

P_TCP_world = [0.39225 * sin(theta), 0, 0.39225 * cos(theta)]
Let P_TCP_world = [x, y, z].
Then, x = 0.39225 * sin(theta)
      y = 0
      z = 0.39225 * cos(theta)

We are given the target position p = [x, y, z] and we need to solve for theta.
From the equations:
x = 0.39225 * sin(theta)
z = 0.39225 * cos(theta)

We can find theta using atan2(x, z):
theta = atan2(x, z)

Let's check if this is correct.
sin(theta) = x / 0.39225
cos(theta) = z / 0.39225
sin^2(theta) + cos^2(theta) = (x / 0.39225)^2 + (z / 0.39225)^2 = 1
x^2 + z^2 = 0.39225^2

If y is not 0, then the target is not reachable because the manipulator is constrained to the XZ plane. However, the problem statement says to assume all targets are reachable. So, we can assume y will always be 0.

theta = atan2(x, z) should be the solution.

Let's test with forward kinematics to verify.
If theta = pi/2, then sin(theta) = 1, cos(theta) = 0.
P_TCP_world = [0.39225 * 1, 0, 0.39225 * 0] = [0.39225, 0, 0]
theta = atan2(0.39225, 0) = pi/2. Correct.

If theta = 0, then sin(theta) = 0, cos(theta) = 1.
P_TCP_world = [0.39225 * 0, 0, 0.39225 * 1] = [0, 0, 0.39225]
theta = atan2(0, 0.39225) = 0. Correct.

If theta = pi, then sin(theta) = 0, cos(theta) = -1.
P_TCP_world = [0.39225 * 0, 0, 0.39225 * -1] = [0, 0, -0.39225]
theta = atan2(0, -0.39225) = pi. Correct.

If theta = pi/4, then sin(theta) = sqrt(2)/2, cos(theta) = sqrt(2)/2.
P_TCP_world = [0.39225 * sqrt(2)/2, 0, 0.39225 * sqrt(2)/2]
theta = atan2(0.39225 * sqrt(2)/2, 0.39225 * sqrt(2)/2) = atan2(1, 1) = pi/4. Correct.

The inverse kinematics solution is theta = atan2(x, z).```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p :The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    import numpy as np
    return np.arctan2(x, z)
