The user wants to find the inverse kinematics for a 1-DOF serial manipulator.
The manipulator has two links: Revolute 1 and TCP.
Revolute 1 is connected to the base frame at [0, 0, 0] with no rotation.
TCP is connected to Revolute 1 at [0, 0, 0.09465] with no rotation.
Revolute 1 rotates around the Z-axis.
The user wants to complete the `inverse_kinematics` function in Python.
The function takes the target position `p` as input and returns the joint value for Revolute 1.

From the forward kinematics result with joint value 0, we can see that:
- Revolute 1 is at the origin [0, 0, 0].
- TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465].

This means that when the joint value is 0, the TCP is located at [0, 0, 0.09465] in world space.
Since Revolute 1 rotates around the Z-axis and both links are aligned along the Z-axis, rotating Revolute 1 will not change the X and Y coordinates of the TCP. It will only rotate the TCP around the Z-axis, but the position of the TCP will remain at [0, 0, 0.09465] in world space regardless of the joint value.

However, the problem description asks for an inverse kinematics solution, which implies that the joint value *should* change based on the target position.
Let's re-examine the problem description and the table.
- Revolute 1 is at [0, 0, 0] relative to the base frame.
- TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to Revolute 1.

If Revolute 1 rotates around the Z-axis, it should affect the X and Y coordinates of the TCP if the TCP link had an offset in the X or Y direction relative to Revolute 1.
However, the TCP link's position relative to Revolute 1 is [0, 0, 0.09465], which is only along the Z-axis.

Let's assume there is a mistake in my understanding or in the problem description, and that rotating Revolute 1 *does* affect the TCP position in the XY plane.
If Revolute 1 rotates by an angle `theta` around the Z-axis, and the TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to Revolute 1, then the TCP's position in world space would be:
- x = 0 * cos(theta) - 0 * sin(theta) = 0
- y = 0 * sin(theta) + 0 * cos(theta) = 0
- z = 0.09465

This is still not changing the X and Y coordinates.

Let's consider a different scenario. What if the TCP's position relative to Revolute 1 was [0.1, 0, 0.09465]?
Then, if Revolute 1 rotates by `theta` around the Z-axis, the TCP's position in world space would be:
- x = 0.1 * cos(theta) - 0 * sin(theta) = 0.1 * cos(theta)
- y = 0.1 * sin(theta) + 0 * cos(theta) = 0.1 * sin(theta)
- z = 0.09465

In this case, rotating Revolute 1 *does* change the X and Y coordinates of the TCP.
If we are given a target position (x, y, z), we can solve for `theta`:
- x = 0.1 * cos(theta)
- y = 0.1 * sin(theta)
- z = 0.09465

From the z-coordinate, we can see that the target z-coordinate must be 0.09465 for the target to be reachable.
If the target z is not 0.09465, then it is not reachable, but the problem statement says to assume all targets are reachable.
So, we can assume that the target z will always be 0.09465.

Now we need to solve for `theta` from x and y:
- cos(theta) = x / 0.1
- sin(theta) = y / 0.1

We can use `atan2(y, x)` to find `theta`.
`theta = atan2(y / 0.1, x / 0.1) = atan2(y, x)`

However, based on the given link positions, the TCP is at [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to Revolute 1.
This means that rotating Revolute 1 around the Z-axis will *not* change the X and Y coordinates of the TCP.
The TCP will always be at [0, 0, 0.09465] in world space, regardless of the joint value.

If the target position `p` is given as input, and we are asked to find the joint value to reach this position, and the TCP position is always [0, 0, 0.09465], then the inverse kinematics problem is only solvable if the target position is exactly [0, 0, 0.09465].
In this case, any joint value will result in the TCP being at [0, 0, 0.09465].
So, we can return any joint value, for example, 0.

Let's double check the forward kinematics again.
If joint value is `theta`, then rotation matrix around Z-axis is:
Rz(theta) = [[cos(theta), -sin(theta), 0],
             [sin(theta),  cos(theta), 0],
             [0,          0,          1]]
Position of Revolute 1 in world frame: [0, 0, 0]
Position of TCP in Revolute 1 frame: [0, 0, 0.09465]
Position of TCP in world frame: Rz(theta) * [0, 0, 0.09465] + [0, 0, 0]
= [[cos(theta), -sin(theta), 0],
   [sin(theta),  cos(theta), 0],
   [0,          0,          1]] * [0, 0, 0.09465]
= [0, 0, 0.09465]

The position of TCP is indeed always [0, 0, 0.09465] regardless of the joint value.
Therefore, if the target position `p` is [0, 0, 0.09465], any joint value will work.
If the target position `p` is not [0, 0, 0.09465], then the target is unreachable, but the problem statement says to assume all targets are reachable.
This implies that the target position `p` must always be [0, 0, 0.09465].

In this case, we can return any joint value. Let's return 0.

Let's test the solution with `TEST_SOLUTION`.
If we input target position [0, 0, 0.09465], and our IK returns 0, then forward kinematics with 0 should give [0, 0, 0.09465]. We already checked this with `FORWARD_KINEMATICS 0`.

Let's try to return `atan2(p[1], p[0])` just in case there is some hidden requirement.
If p = [0, 0, 0.09465], then atan2(0, 0) is undefined. But if we assume p is always reachable, and the only reachable position is [0, 0, 0.09465], then maybe we can just return 0.

Let's try returning 0 as the joint value.```python
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p :The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    return 0.0
```
