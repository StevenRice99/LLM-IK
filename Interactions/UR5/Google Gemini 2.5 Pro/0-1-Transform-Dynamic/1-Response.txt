To derive the inverse kinematics solution for the given 2-DOF robot, we will determine the joint angles `theta1` (for Revolute 1, Z-axis rotation) and `theta2` (for Revolute 2, Y-axis rotation) that achieve the target TCP position `p = (px, py, pz)` and orientation `r = (rx, ry, rz)`. The problem states that all target poses `(p,r)` are reachable.

The robot kinematics are as follows:
1.  **Revolute 1**: Rotation `theta1` about the Z-axis. Origin at `[0,0,0]`.
2.  **Revolute 2**: Located at `[0, L1y, 0]` relative to Link 1's frame, where `L1y = 0.13585`. Rotation `theta2` about its local Y-axis.
3.  **TCP**: Located at `[0, L2y_tcp, L2z_tcp]` relative to Link 2's frame, where `L2y_tcp = -0.1197` and `L2z_tcp = 0.425`. The TCP has a fixed orientation `[0,0,0]` RPY relative to Link 2.

The forward kinematics equations for the TCP position `(px, py, pz)` are:
`px = cos(theta1) * (sin(theta2) * L2z_tcp) - sin(theta1) * (L1y + L2y_tcp)`
`py = sin(theta1) * (sin(theta2) * L2z_tcp) + cos(theta1) * (L1y + L2y_tcp)`
`pz = cos(theta2) * L2z_tcp`

The orientation of the TCP is determined by `RotZ(theta1) * RotY(theta2)`. When converted to RPY Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw, corresponding to `r = (rx, ry, rz)`), and assuming not in a gimbal lock configuration:
*   `roll (rx)` will be 0.
*   `pitch (ry)` will be `theta2`.
*   `yaw (rz)` will be `theta1`.

Given that the target `(p,r)` is reachable:
1.  The target roll `r[0]` must be 0 (or compatible, which we assume means 0 for a non-gimbal lock case).
2.  The target pitch `r[1]` must correspond to `theta2`. Thus, `theta2 = r[1]`.
3.  The target yaw `r[2]` must correspond to `theta1`.

We can use `theta2 = r[1]` to simplify the position equations.
Let `s2 = sin(theta2)` and `c2 = cos(theta2)`.
The `pz` equation `pz = c2 * L2z_tcp` must hold. This is guaranteed by the reachability assumption.

Now, let's define intermediate coefficients:
`X_coeff = s2 * L2z_tcp`
`Y_coeff = L1y + L2y_tcp = 0.13585 - 0.1197 = 0.01615`

The equations for `px` and `py` become:
`px = X_coeff * cos(theta1) - Y_coeff * sin(theta1)`
`py = X_coeff * sin(theta1) + Y_coeff * cos(theta1)`

This is a standard problem that can be solved for `theta1` using `atan2`. If we have:
`x = A * cos(phi) - B * sin(phi)`
`y = A * sin(phi) + B * cos(phi)`
Then `phi = atan2(y, x) - atan2(B, A)`.
In our case, `A = X_coeff`, `B = Y_coeff`, and `phi = theta1`.
So, `theta1 = atan2(py, px) - atan2(Y_coeff, X_coeff)`.

The reachability assumption also guarantees that this calculated `theta1` will be consistent with the target yaw `r[2]` (modulo 2*pi).

The final IK solution is:
1.  Set `theta2 = r[1]`.
2.  Calculate `s2 = sin(theta2)`.
3.  Calculate `X_coeff = s2 * L2z_tcp`.
4.  `Y_coeff` is constant `0.01615`.
5.  Calculate `theta1 = atan2(py, px) - atan2(Y_coeff, X_coeff)`.
6.  Return `(theta1, theta2)`.
