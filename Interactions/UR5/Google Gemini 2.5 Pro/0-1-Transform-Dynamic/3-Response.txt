Solution:
The inverse kinematics problem for this 2-DOF robot (Revolute 1 around Z-axis, Revolute 2 around local Y-axis) is solved by first determining possible values for `theta2` (joint 2) from the target Z position, and then for each `theta2`, calculating the corresponding `theta1` (joint 1) from the target X and Y positions. Finally, among the `(theta1, theta2)` pairs that satisfy the target position, we select the one that best matches the target orientation.

**Robot Parameters:**
*   `L1y = 0.13585`: Offset of Joint 2 from Joint 1 along Joint 1's Y-axis.
*   `L2y_tcp = -0.1197`: TCP offset from Joint 2 along Joint 2's Y-axis.
*   `L2z_tcp = 0.425`: TCP offset from Joint 2 along Joint 2's Z-axis.
*   `L_sum_y = L1y + L2y_tcp = 0.01615`.

**Forward Kinematics for Position (px, py, pz):**
*   `px = cos(theta1) * sin(theta2) * L2z_tcp - sin(theta1) * L_sum_y`
*   `py = sin(theta1) * sin(theta2) * L2z_tcp + cos(theta1) * L_sum_y`
*   `pz = cos(theta2) * L2z_tcp`

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Determine Target Orientation Angles (`th1_orient_target`, `th2_orient_target`):**
    The robot's structure `RotZ(theta1) * RotY(theta2)` can achieve a target RPY orientation `(rx, ry, rz)` if `rx` (roll) is 0 or `pi`.
    *   If `rx` is close to 0:
        `th1_orient_target = normalize_angle(rz)`
        `th2_orient_target = normalize_angle(ry)`
    *   If `rx` is close to `pi`:
        `th1_orient_target = normalize_angle(rz + pi)`
        `th2_orient_target = normalize_angle(atan2(sin(ry), -cos(ry)))`
    (Angle normalization brings values to `[-pi, pi]`).

2.  **Calculate `cos(theta2)` from `pz`:**
    From `pz = cos(theta2) * L2z_tcp`, we get `cos_th2 = pz / L2z_tcp`.
    This value is clamped to `[-1, 1]` for robustness.
    `alpha_acos = acos(cos_th2)` gives a principal value for `theta2` in `[0, pi]`.

3.  **Generate `theta2` Candidates:**
    Possible values for `theta2` that satisfy `pz` and are within typical joint limits `[-2pi, 2pi]` include:
    *   `alpha_acos`
    *   `-alpha_acos`
    *   `alpha_acos - 2*pi`
    *   `-alpha_acos + 2*pi`
    These candidates are filtered to be within the robot's joint limits.

4.  **Find the Best `(theta1, theta2)` Pair:**
    Iterate through each `th2_k_candidate`:
    a.  Calculate `s2k = sin(th2_k_candidate)`.
    b.  Let `Ak = s2k * L2z_tcp` and `Bk = L_sum_y`.
    c.  Solve for `th1_k_candidate`:
        `th1_k_candidate = normalize_angle(atan2(py, px) - atan2(Bk, Ak))`
        This formula derives `theta1` from `px` and `py` given `theta2`.
    d.  Calculate the orientation difference between the achieved orientation `(th1_k_candidate, th2_k_candidate)` and the target orientation `(th1_orient_target, th2_orient_target)`. The difference is `abs(normalize_angle(th1_k_candidate - th1_orient_target)) + abs(normalize_angle(th2_k_candidate - th2_orient_target))`.
    e.  The `(th1_k_candidate, th2_k_candidate)` pair with the minimum orientation difference is selected as the best solution. Tie-breaking rules (e.g., preferring solutions with `theta2` closer to `alpha_acos` or `-alpha_acos`) can be applied if multiple candidates yield the same minimal difference.

5.  **Return the Best Solution:**
    The `(theta1, theta2)` pair found in the previous step is the result.

This approach ensures that the selected joint angles satisfy the target position `p` and most closely match the target orientation `r` among the possible position solutions.
