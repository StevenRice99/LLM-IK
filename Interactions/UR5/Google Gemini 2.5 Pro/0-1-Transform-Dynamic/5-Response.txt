The previous solution was very close, with discrepancies at the level of floating-point precision. The feedback indicated that the "correct" joint values led to marginally better outcomes (e.g., orientation error of `1.54e-15` vs `1.80e-15`). The issue likely stemmed from the tolerance (`epsilon`) used in comparing these orientation errors and in the tie-breaking logic. If the tolerance was too large (e.g., `1e-4`), solutions with tiny differences in quality might be considered "equal," and the tie-breaker might not select the truly optimal one according to the reference solution.

The refined approach involves:
1.  **Stricter Tolerances for Comparisons**: Using a much smaller epsilon (e.g., `1e-10` or `1e-12`) when comparing orientation differences and during tie-breaking. This ensures that even minute improvements in the solution quality are recognized.
2.  **Refined Selection Logic**:
    *   If a new candidate solution is significantly better (its orientation error is smaller than the current best error by more than the small comparison epsilon), it becomes the new best.
    *   If a new candidate's error is virtually identical (within the small comparison epsilon) to the current best error, then tie-breaking rules are applied:
        *   Prefer the solution with a smaller absolute value of `theta2` (joint 2).
        *   If `abs(theta2)` values are also virtually identical, further tie-break by preferring a smaller absolute value of `theta1` (joint 1).
3.  **Precise Joint Limit Checks**: Ensuring joint candidates are strictly within the `[-2*pi, 2*pi]` limits, using a small epsilon for floating point comparisons against these boundaries.

The core algorithm for generating `theta2` candidates from `pz` and then solving for `theta1` from `px, py, theta2` remains the same. The target orientation angles (`th1_orient_target`, `th2_orient_target`) derived from the input `r` (roll, pitch, yaw) also follow the same logic, correctly handling cases where target roll `rx` is `0` or `+/-pi`.

By making the selection criteria more sensitive to small numerical differences, the algorithm should now be able to converge to the specific "correct" joint values provided in the feedback, assuming those values are indeed the ones that minimize the orientation error according to the defined metric, even if by a very small margin.
