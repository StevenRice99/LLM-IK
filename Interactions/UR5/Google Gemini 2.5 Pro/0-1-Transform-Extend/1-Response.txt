To derive the closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we will primarily use the target position `p = (px, py, pz)` of the TCP. The problem states that we should assume all targets are reachable, which implies that the given orientation `r` will be consistent with the position `p` for the calculated joint angles. This approach is also hinted at by the "EXISTING" solution, which solves a sub-chain based on position.

Let `theta1` be the angle for Revolute Joint 1 (rotation about Z-axis) and `theta2` be the angle for Revolute Joint 2 (rotation about its local Y-axis).

The link parameters are:
*   Link 1 to Link 2: Translation `[0, L1_y, 0]` where `L1_y = 0.13585`.
*   Link 2 to TCP: Translation `[0, L2_y_tcp, L2_z_tcp]` where `L2_y_tcp = -0.1197` and `L2_z_tcp = 0.425`.

The forward kinematics equations for the TCP position `(px, py, pz)` are:
1.  `px = -sin(theta1)*(L1_y + L2_y_tcp) + cos(theta1)*sin(theta2)*L2_z_tcp`
2.  `py =  cos(theta1)*(L1_y + L2_y_tcp) + sin(theta1)*sin(theta2)*L2_z_tcp`
3.  `pz =  cos(theta2)*L2_z_tcp`

We can solve for `theta2` using equation (3):
`cos(theta2) = pz / L2_z_tcp`
Since `L2_z_tcp = 0.425` is non-zero, and assuming the target is reachable, `abs(pz / L2_z_tcp) <= 1`.
`theta2 = acos(pz / L2_z_tcp)`
This will yield `theta2` in the range `[0, pi]`. Consequently, `sin(theta2)` will be non-negative.

Now, substitute `sin(theta2)` and `cos(theta2)` into equations (1) and (2).
Let:
*   `A = L1_y + L2_y_tcp`
*   `B = sin(theta2) * L2_z_tcp`

Equations (1) and (2) become:
1.  `px = -A*sin(theta1) + B*cos(theta1)`
2.  `py =  A*cos(theta1) + B*sin(theta1)`

This system can be rewritten as:
1.  `px = B*cos(theta1) - A*sin(theta1)`
2.  `py = B*sin(theta1) + A*cos(theta1)`

This is a standard form that can be solved for `theta1` using `atan2`.
If we consider `(px, py)` as a point in a 2D plane, these equations relate `(px, py)` to `(B, A)` through a rotation `theta1`.
The solution for `theta1` is:
`theta1 = atan2(py, px) - atan2(A, B)`

The value `A = L1_y + L2_y_tcp = 0.13585 - 0.1197 = 0.01615`. Since `A` is non-zero, `atan2(A, B)` is well-defined.
Also, `px^2 + py^2 = A^2 + B^2`. Since `A` is non-zero, `px` and `py` cannot both be zero simultaneously, so `atan2(py, px)` is also well-defined.

The resulting `theta1` will be in the range `(-2pi, 2pi)`, and `theta2` in `[0, pi]`, both within the specified joint limits of `[-2pi, 2pi]`.
