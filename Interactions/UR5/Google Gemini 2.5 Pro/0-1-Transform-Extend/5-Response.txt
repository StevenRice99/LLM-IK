The problem requires a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of a 2-DOF serial manipulator. The solution should provide joint angles `(theta1, theta2)` that allow the robot's TCP to reach a target position `p = (px, py, pz)` and orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)`.

**Robot Kinematic Parameters:**
From the "DETAILS" section:
*   `L1_y = 0.13585`: Y-offset from Revolute Joint 1 to Revolute Joint 2.
*   `L2_y_tcp = -0.1197`: TCP's Y-offset in Link 2's frame (frame of Revolute Joint 2).
*   `L2_z_tcp = 0.425`: TCP's Z-offset in Link 2's frame.

Let's define two key constants for our IK derivation:
*   `S = L2_z_tcp = 0.425`
*   `A = L1_y + L2_y_tcp = 0.13585 - 0.1197 = 0.01615`

**Forward Kinematics Equations:**
Based on standard sequential transformations (`RotZ(theta1)` followed by translation `[0, A, 0]` in the new XY plane, then `RotY(theta2)` affecting the `S` length):
The position of the TCP `(px, py, pz)` is given by:
1.  `px = S * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) - A * sin(theta1)`
2.  `py = S * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1) + A * cos(theta1)`
3.  `pz = S * cos(theta2)`

The orientation of the TCP `R_tcp` in the base frame is `RotZ(theta1) * RotY(theta2)`:
`R_tcp = [[cos(theta1)*cos(theta2), -sin(theta1), cos(theta1)*sin(theta2)],`
         `[sin(theta1)*cos(theta2),  cos(theta1), sin(theta1)*sin(theta2)],`
         `[-sin(theta2),             0,           cos(theta2)        ]]`

**Inverse Kinematics Solution Strategy:**

1.  **Solve for `theta2` using `pz`:**
    From `pz = S * cos(theta2)`, we get `cos(theta2) = pz / S`.
    This yields two potential solutions for `theta2` (assuming `abs(pz/S) <= 1`, which is guaranteed by the problem statement "all targets ... will be reachable"):
    *   `theta2_cand1 = acos(pz / S)`
    *   `theta2_cand2 = -acos(pz / S)`

2.  **Determine target `theta2` from orientation `r`:**
    The input orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)` corresponds to `R_tcp`. Assuming ZYX Euler angle convention (`R_target = Rz(yaw)Ry(pitch)Rx(roll)`), the elements `R_target(2,0) = -sin(pitch)` and `R_target(2,2) = cos(pitch)*cos(roll)`.
    Comparing these with `R_tcp(2,0) = -sin(theta2)` and `R_tcp(2,2) = cos(theta2)`, we can find the `theta2` implied by the target orientation:
    `theta2_from_orientation = atan2(sin(pitch), cos(pitch)*cos(roll))`
    (Note: `sin(theta2) = sin(pitch)` and `cos(theta2) = cos(pitch)*cos(roll)` must hold for the orientation to be reachable).

3.  **Disambiguate `theta2`:**
    Choose between `theta2_cand1` and `theta2_cand2` based on which one is angularly closer to `theta2_from_orientation`. The problem implies reachability, so one of these candidates derived from `pz` should match the `theta2` required for the orientation.
    We calculate the shortest angle between `theta2_cand_i` and `theta2_from_orientation`.
    Let `chosen_theta2` be the candidate that is closer.

4.  **Solve for `theta1`:**
    Once `chosen_theta2` is determined, we use the `px` and `py` equations.
    Let `k1 = S * sin(chosen_theta2)` and `k2 = A`.
    `px = k1*cos(theta1) - k2*sin(theta1)`
    `py = k1*sin(theta1) + k2*cos(theta1)`
    This system can be solved for `theta1` using `atan2`:
    `theta1 = atan2(py, px) - atan2(k2, k1)`
    So, `final_theta1 = atan2(py, px) - atan2(A, S * sin(chosen_theta2))`

This approach ensures that the `pz` component of the position is met and uses the orientation `r` to select the appropriate `theta2` solution, which then determines `theta1`.
