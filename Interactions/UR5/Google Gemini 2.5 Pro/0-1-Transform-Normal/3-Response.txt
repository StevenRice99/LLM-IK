To solve for the inverse kinematics of the 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to find the joint angles `theta1` (for Revolute 1) and `theta2` (for Revolute 2) that achieve the target TCP position `p = (px, py, pz)` and orientation `r = (rx, ry, rz)`.

The "DETAILS" section provides the kinematic structure:
1.  **Revolute 1**: Rotates around the Z-axis by `theta1`. Its origin is at `[0,0,0]`.
2.  **Revolute 2**: Positioned at `[0, 0.13585, 0]` relative to Revolute 1's frame. It rotates around its local Y-axis by `theta2`.
3.  **TCP**: Positioned at `[0, -0.1197, 0.425]` relative to Revolute 2's frame. Its orientation relative to Revolute 2's frame is `[0,0,0]`.

Let's analyze the forward kinematics for orientation.
The orientation of Revolute 1's frame relative to the base is `RotZ(theta1)`.
The orientation of Revolute 2's frame relative to Revolute 1's frame is `RotY(theta2)`.
The TCP has a fixed orientation relative to Revolute 2's frame.
Thus, the overall orientation of the TCP relative to the base is `R_tcp = RotZ(theta1) * RotY(theta2)`.

The problem provides an example from `FORWARD_KINEMATICS(joint1=0.5, joint2=0.3)` where `joint1` is `theta1` and `joint2` is `theta2`.
The output for this case is `Orientation = [0, 0.2999..., 0.5000...]`.
This strongly suggests that the reported orientation `[roll, pitch, yaw]` corresponds to `[0, theta2, theta1]`.

Given that the target orientation is `r = (rx, ry, rz)`, and assuming this also represents `[roll, pitch, yaw]`:
*   `rx` must be 0 for the orientation to be achievable by this manipulator structure.
*   `ry` (pitch) must correspond to `theta2`.
*   `rz` (yaw) must correspond to `theta1`.

So, we can directly determine the joint angles from the target orientation `r`:
`theta2 = ry`
`theta1 = rz`

The problem states, "Assume all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable." This implies that if a target `(p, r)` is provided:
1.  `rx` will be 0 (or consistent with a 0 roll).
2.  The joint angles `theta1 = rz` and `theta2 = ry` derived from the orientation `r` will, when used in the forward kinematics position equations, result in the target position `p = (px, py, pz)`.

Therefore, the closed-form analytical solution for `(theta1, theta2)` is obtained directly from the `ry` and `rz` components of the target orientation `r`.

The constants for link lengths are:
*   `L1_y = 0.13585` (Y-offset of Revolute 2 from Revolute 1)
*   `L_tcp_y = -0.1197` (Y-offset of TCP from Revolute 2)
*   `L_tcp_z = 0.425` (Z-offset of TCP from Revolute 2)

The forward kinematics equations for position are:
`px = L_tcp_z * cos(theta1) * sin(theta2) - (L1_y + L_tcp_y) * sin(theta1)`
`py = L_tcp_z * sin(theta1) * sin(theta2) + (L1_y + L_tcp_y) * cos(theta1)`
`pz = L_tcp_z * cos(theta2)`

Since the target is reachable, substituting `theta1 = rz` and `theta2 = ry` into these equations will yield `px, py, pz`. We do not need to solve these equations for `theta1` and `theta2` because `r` already provides them.
