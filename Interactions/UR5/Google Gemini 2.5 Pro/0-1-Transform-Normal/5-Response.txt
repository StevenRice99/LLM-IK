The previous solution assumed a direct mapping from the target orientation `r = (rx, ry, rz)` to joint angles `theta1=rz, theta2=ry`. This is only valid when the roll `rx` is zero. The feedback indicates cases where `rx` is `pi`, which requires a different interpretation.

Let the target orientation be `R_target = (rx_T, ry_T, rz_T)`.
The forward kinematics for orientation results in `RPY = [roll, pitch, yaw]` where:
- `pitch (ry_calc) = asin(sin(theta2))`
- If `cos(theta2) >= 0` (i.e., `theta2` is in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`):
    - `roll (rx_calc) = 0`
    - `pitch (ry_calc) = theta2`
    - `yaw (rz_calc) = theta1`
- If `cos(theta2) < 0` (i.e., `theta2` is outside `(-pi/2, pi/2)`):
    - `roll (rx_calc) = pi` (or `-pi`, `atan2(0, negative)` is `pi`)
    - `pitch (ry_calc) = asin(sin(theta2))` (this will be `theta2` folded into `[-pi/2, pi/2]`)
    - `yaw (rz_calc) = theta1 + pi` (normalized, because `atan2(s1*c2, c1*c2)` with `c2<0` becomes `atan2(-s1,-c1)`)

Now, for inverse kinematics, given `(rx_T, ry_T, rz_T)`:

Case 1: `rx_T` is close to 0.
This implies `cos(theta2) >= 0`.
So, `theta2 = ry_T`.
And `theta1 = rz_T`.

Case 2: `rx_T` is close to `pi` (or `-pi`).
This implies `cos(theta2) < 0`.
The relationship `rz_T = theta1_actual + pi` (normalized) means `theta1_actual = rz_T - pi` (normalized). If `rx_T` was `-pi`, then `theta1_actual = rz_T + pi`. This can be written as `theta1 = rz_T - rx_T` (where `rx_T` is `pi` or `-pi`).
The relationship `ry_T = asin(sin(theta2_actual))` means `sin(theta2_actual) = sin(ry_T)`.
Since we also need `cos(theta2_actual) < 0`:
The solutions for `sin(x) = sin(ry_T)` are `x = ry_T + 2k*pi` and `x = (pi - ry_T) + 2k*pi`.
`cos(ry_T)` is `>0` (assuming `ry_T` is the principal value in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`).
`cos(pi - ry_T) = -cos(ry_T) < 0`.
So, we must choose the form `theta2_actual = (pi - ry_T) + 2k*pi`.
A common solution is `theta2 = pi - ry_T`. Another is `theta2 = -pi - ry_T` (which is `(pi - ry_T) - 2pi`).
The feedback examples show that either of these might be the "correct" one. Since the problem asks for *a* solution, `theta2 = pi - ry_T` is a valid choice.

The joint limits are `[-2pi, 2pi]`. The returned values should be within this range, but the specific `2k*pi` multiple is not strictly determined by the target pose alone if multiple solutions are within limits. We will provide the simplest ones.
