To find the joint angles `(theta1, theta2)` for the 2-DOF manipulator, we will use an analytical approach combined with a check against the target orientation. The core idea is to first find `theta2` candidates from the target Z position, then for each `theta2`, find `theta1` candidates from the target X and Y positions. Finally, for each `(theta1, theta2)` pair, calculate the resulting orientation and compare it to the target orientation.

**Constants:**
*   `L1y = 0.13585` (Y-offset of Revolute 2 from Revolute 1 frame)
*   `L2y = -0.1197` (TCP y-offset from Revolute 2 frame)
*   `L2z = 0.425` (TCP z-offset from Revolute 2 frame)
*   `L_sum_y = L1y + L2y = 0.01615`

**Inverse Kinematics Steps:**

1.  **Solve for `theta2` from Position `pz`**:
    The Z-coordinate of the TCP is given by `pz = L2z * cos(theta2)`.
    So, `cos_theta2_val = pz / L2z`. This value must be clamped to `[-1, 1]` to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies.
    Two primary solutions for `theta2` in the range `[-pi, pi]` are:
    *   `th2_A = acos(cos_theta2_val)` (gives `theta2` in `[0, pi]`)
    *   `th2_B = -acos(cos_theta2_val)` (gives `theta2` in `[-pi, 0]`)
    We will test these two candidates for `theta2`.

2.  **Solve for `theta1` from Positions `px`, `py` for each `theta2` candidate**:
    The XY-coordinates of the TCP are:
    `px = L2z * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1) - L_sum_y * sin(theta1)`
    `py = L2z * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1) + L_sum_y * cos(theta1)`
    This can be seen as a 2D rotation problem. Let `A = L2z * sin(theta2)` and `B = L_sum_y`.
    Then `px = A*cos(theta1) - B*sin(theta1)` and `py = A*sin(theta1) + B*cos(theta1)`.
    The solution for `theta1` is `theta1_base = atan2(py, px) - atan2(B, A)`.
    We will use `theta1_cand = angle_normalize(theta1_base)`, where `angle_normalize` brings the angle to the `[-pi, pi]` range. The "correct" solutions provided in feedback all have `theta1` and `theta2` within `[-pi, pi]` (or very close due to float precision).

3.  **Verify Orientation**:
    For each `(theta1_cand, theta2_cand)` pair obtained:
    *   Calculate the RPY orientation `(calc_roll, calc_pitch, calc_yaw)` that these joint angles produce. The RPY convention derived from the problem description and forward kinematics matrix `R = Rz(theta1)Ry(theta2)` is:
        *   `j2_normalized = angle_normalize(theta2_cand)`
        *   `calc_pitch = asin(sin(theta2_cand))` (This results in a pitch in `[-pi/2, pi/2]`)
        *   If `abs(j2_normalized) <= pi/2` (i.e., `cos(theta2_cand) >= 0`):
            `calc_roll = 0.0`
            `calc_yaw = angle_normalize(theta1_cand)`
        *   Else (`cos(theta2_cand) < 0`):
            `calc_roll = pi` (raw value, will be normalized)
            `calc_yaw = angle_normalize(theta1_cand + pi)`
        *   The final calculated RPY is `(angle_normalize(calc_roll), calc_pitch, angle_normalize(calc_yaw))`. Note: `angle_normalize(pi)` results in `-pi`.
    *   Compare this calculated RPY with the normalized target RPY `(rx_T_norm, ry_T_norm, rz_T_norm)`.
        *   A tolerance `tol_angle` is used for comparison.
        *   For roll, `pi` and `-pi` are considered equivalent. So, `roll_match` is true if `abs(calc_roll - rx_T_norm) < tol_angle` OR if both `calc_roll` and `rx_T_norm` are `+/-pi`.
    *   If all three components (roll, pitch, yaw) match, the pair `(theta1_cand, theta2_cand)` is the solution. We test `th2_A` first, then `th2_B`.

This strategy prioritizes solutions where `theta1` and `theta2` are in their principal range `[-pi, pi]` and uses a robust comparison for the roll component of orientation.
