The feedback consistently indicates that the joint angles `(theta1, theta2)` produced by my previous solution (V5) are either identical to the "correct joint values" provided by the reference solver, or differ by a computationally insignificant amount (1 ULP - Unit in the Last Place). Despite this, the test system reports that the *reached* position and orientation (when using these correct joint angles in its own Forward Kinematics (FK) model) slightly deviate from the target.

This situation suggests:
1.  My inverse kinematics (IK) method, which derives `theta1` and `theta2` directly from the target orientation matrix, is analytically sound and produces the correct joint angles for the specified robot kinematics.
2.  The observed discrepancies in the final Cartesian pose (position and orientation) are likely due to minor differences in how Forward Kinematics are evaluated between the test system and a standard Python `math` based FK (e.g., slight variations in floating-point arithmetic, trigonometric function implementations, or the precise values of kinematic constants used by the test system's FK).

The task is to provide a Python function that computes the inverse kinematics, i.e., joint angles from a target pose. Since my function is already generating the "correct joint values," it is fulfilling its purpose. The problem statement "Assume all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable" implies that a unique `(theta1, theta2)` derived from the target orientation should also satisfy the target position.

The derivation used is:
1.  Construct the target rotation matrix `R_target` from the input ZYX Euler angles `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)`.
    `R_target = Rz(yaw) * Ry(pitch) * Rx(roll)`
2.  The robot's TCP orientation is kinematically given by `R_tcp = Rz(theta1) * Ry(theta2)`.
    Expanding this gives: `R_tcp = [[c1*c2, -s1, c1*s2], [s1*c2, c1, s1*s2], [-s2, 0, c2]]`
3.  By equating `R_target` with `R_tcp`:
    *   From `R_target[2,2] = cos(theta2)` and `R_target[2,0] = -sin(theta2)`, `theta2` is found using `atan2(-R_target[2,0], R_target[2,2])`.
    *   From `R_target[1,1] = cos(theta1)` and `R_target[0,1] = -sin(theta1)`, `theta1` is found using `atan2(-R_target[0,1], R_target[1,1])`.

This method is standard for this type of kinematic structure. Given that the joint values produced are correct, I will provide the same Python function code as in V5.
