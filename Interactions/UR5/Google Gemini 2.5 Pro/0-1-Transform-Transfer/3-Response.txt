Okay, I've refined the inverse kinematics solution. The main changes focus on improving numerical precision in the calculation of the forward kinematics rotation matrix (`R_calculated`) that is used for checking against the target orientation. Instead of re-calculating `cos(theta2)` and `sin(theta2)` from the `theta2` angle (which might introduce small errors if `theta2` itself is a result of `acos`), I now use the more direct `cos_theta2_val = pz / L2z_tcp` and `sin_theta2_val = +/- sqrt(1 - cos_theta2_val^2)` in the construction of `R_calculated`.

Here's the updated Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z] (ZYX Euler: yaw, pitch, roll).
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """

    # Assuming r = (roll, pitch, yaw) for ZYX Euler angles as per typical conventions.
    # The problem statement implies r = [x,y,z] which could be roll, pitch, yaw.
    # If it's [yaw, pitch, roll], the R_target construction would need adjustment.
    # Based on common robotics usage [x,y,z] for rpy is roll, pitch, yaw.
