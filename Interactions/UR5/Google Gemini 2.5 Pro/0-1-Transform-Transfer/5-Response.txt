I've analyzed the feedback and the core issue seems to be the selection of the correct inverse kinematics solution from the two candidates generated by the position-based IK. The previous method of comparing full rotation matrices was susceptible to minute floating-point inaccuracies, leading to the selection of a joint pair that was extremely close but not identical to the "correct" one, causing small deviations in the final TCP pose.

The refined strategy is as follows:
1.  **Derive Ideal Joint Angles from Target Orientation**: Given the target orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)`, we first construct the target rotation matrix `R_target`. Since the robot's TCP orientation is a result of `Rz(theta1) * Ry(theta2)`, we can extract the ideal `theta1_orient` and `theta2_orient` that would produce `R_target` if `R_target` is perfectly representable in this form (which is guaranteed by the problem statement "Assume all targets ... will be reachable").
    *   `theta2_orient = atan2(-R_target[2,0], R_target[2,2])`
    *   `theta1_orient = atan2(-R_target[0,1], R_target[1,1])`
2.  **Calculate Position-Based IK Solutions**: Compute the two standard inverse kinematics solutions for position, `(theta1_solA, theta2_solA)` and `(theta1_solB, theta2_solB)`, using the provided geometric approach. `theta2_solA` will typically be `acos(...)` and `theta2_solB` will be `-acos(...)`.
3.  **Select the Best Match**: Normalize all angles (both the orientation-derived ideal angles and the position-derived solution candidates) to a consistent range (e.g., `[-pi, pi]`). Then, compare each position-based solution pair with the ideal orientation-derived pair. The solution `(theta1_solX, theta2_solX)` that has the smallest summed absolute difference in normalized joint angles to `(theta1_orient_norm, theta2_orient_norm)` is chosen as the final answer. The originally computed (non-normalized) values for this chosen pair are returned.

This method avoids direct comparison of rotation matrices for selection and instead uses the analytical understanding of the robot's orientation kinematics to guide the choice between the position-based solutions, which should be more robust against floating-point precision issues in the selection step.
