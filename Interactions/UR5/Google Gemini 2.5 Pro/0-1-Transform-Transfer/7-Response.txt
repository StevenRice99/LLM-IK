The feedback indicates that the previously generated joint values were extremely close to the "correct" ones, differing only by amounts attributable to floating-point precision at the ULP (Unit in the Last Place) level. This suggests that the core analytical approach for position was sound, but the selection between IK solutions or the direct calculation of angles might have suffered from minute precision differences compared to the reference solution.

Given the problem statement "Assume all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable," this implies that if we find joint angles `(theta1, theta2)` that satisfy the target orientation `r`, these same angles must also satisfy the target position `p`.

The orientation of the TCP is given by `R_tcp = Rz(theta1) * Ry(theta2)`.
`Rz(theta1) = [[cos(t1), -sin(t1), 0], [sin(t1), cos(t1), 0], [0, 0, 1]]`
`Ry(theta2) = [[cos(t2), 0, sin(t2)], [0, 1, 0], [-sin(t2), 0, cos(t2)]]`
So, `R_tcp = [[c1*c2, -s1, c1*s2], [s1*c2, c1, s1*s2], [-s2, 0, c2]]`.

If `R_target` is the target orientation matrix derived from the input `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)`:
1.  From `R_tcp[2,0] = -sin(theta2)` and `R_tcp[2,2] = cos(theta2)`, we can find `theta2 = atan2(-R_tcp[2,0], R_tcp[2,2])`.
2.  From `R_tcp[0,1] = -sin(theta1)` and `R_tcp[1,1] = cos(theta1)`, we can find `theta1 = atan2(-R_tcp[0,1], R_tcp[1,1])`.

These `theta1` and `theta2` values are derived directly from the target orientation. Due to the "reachable" guarantee, these angles should also produce the target position `p`. This method avoids potential ULP discrepancies that might arise from calculations like `acos(pz / L2z_tcp)` if the input `pz` or the constant `L2z_tcp` have slightly different effective precision in the test system versus my calculation chain.

The refined solution is to calculate `theta1` and `theta2` directly from the elements of the target rotation matrix.
