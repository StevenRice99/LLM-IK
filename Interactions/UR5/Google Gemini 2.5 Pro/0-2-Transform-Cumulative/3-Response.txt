The feedback indicates that the implemented inverse kinematics solution fails to reach the target positions and orientations for several test cases. The core of the inverse kinematics solution involves:
1.  Calculating the wrist center (`P_wc`) by subtracting the TCP offset (in base frame coordinates) from the target TCP position.
2.  Solving for joint 1 (`q1`) based on the `x` and `y` coordinates of `P_wc`.
3.  Solving for joint 2 (`q2`) based on the `z` coordinate of `P_wc` and the `x` coordinate of `P_wc` transformed into Frame 1 (after `q1` rotation).
4.  Solving for joint 3 (`q3`) by considering the remaining orientation.

The original `q1` calculation was:
`theta_p = atan2(pwc_y, pwc_x)`
`asin_val = asin((d1y + d2y) / sqrt(pwc_x^2 + pwc_y^2))`
`q1 = theta_p - asin_val`

This equation `R_xy * sin(theta_p - q1) = (d1y + d2y)` has two solutions for `(theta_p - q1)` in a `2*pi` range:
1.  `theta_p - q1 = asin_val` => `q1_sol1 = theta_p - asin_val`
2.  `theta_p - q1 = pi - asin_val` => `q1_sol2 = theta_p - (pi - asin_val) = theta_p - pi + asin_val`

Comparing the `q1_mycode` (produced by the original code logic) and `q1_corr` (the correct joint value) from the feedback for the first failed case:
`q1_mycode = -0.08131...`
`q1_corr = -3.10139...`
My re-calculation of `q1_sol1` (using my derived `pwc` values) was `-0.06379...`.
My re-calculation of `q1_sol2` was `-3.08376...`.
The `q1_corr` is close to `q1_sol2`. The `q1_mycode` from feedback is somewhat close to `q1_sol1`.

This pattern (where `q1_corr` aligns with the second solution `q1_sol2`) was observed in other test cases as well upon closer inspection of the angular differences (often differing by approximately `pi`). This suggests that the original code was consistently picking one branch of the `q1` solution, while the target solutions often required the other branch.

The proposed change is to modify the calculation of `q1` to use the second solution:
`q1 = theta_p - math.pi + asin_val`

The subsequent calculations for `q2` and `q3` depend on `q1` and their formulas appear to be correct:
`q2 = atan2(cos(q1)*pwc_x + sin(q1)*pwc_y, pwc_z)`
`q3` is derived from `Ry(q3) = Ry(-q2) * Rz(-q1) * R_tcp_base`.

The discrepancy between my re-calculated `q1_sol1` and the `q1_mycode` reported in the feedback (e.g., `-0.06379` vs. `-0.08131`) suggests that the `pwc_x, pwc_y` values (or their combination into `R_xy` and `theta_p`) used by the testing environment to generate `q1_mycode` might have been slightly different from my `pwc` calculation based on the provided `p, r` and constants. However, the fact that `q2_mycode` matched perfectly when using `q1_mycode` (from feedback) and my `pwc_z` indicates that the overall structure of `q2` calculation is sound, and `pwc_z` is likely consistent. The primary issue seems to be the choice of `q1`.

By switching to the alternative solution for `q1`, it is expected that the IK will now follow the branch that leads to the "correct" joint values provided in the feedback.
