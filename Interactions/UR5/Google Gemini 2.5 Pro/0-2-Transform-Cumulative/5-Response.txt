The feedback indicates that the previous solution, which used `q1 = theta_p - math.pi + asin_val`, consistently produced joint values (`q_mycode`) that differed from the correct ones (`q_corr`). Specifically, `q1_mycode` and `q2_mycode` often appeared to be alternative solutions to `q1_corr` and `q2_corr` (e.g., `q2_mycode` was `-q2_corr`).

My analysis of the first failed case in the latest feedback showed:
1.  The `P_wc` calculation is standard.
2.  The `q1` equation `sin(theta_p - q1) = K_val / R_xy` has two solutions for `q1` in a `2*pi` range:
    *   `q1_sol1 = theta_p - asin(K_val / R_xy)`
    *   `q1_sol2 = theta_p - (math.pi - asin(K_val / R_xy)) = theta_p - math.pi + asin_val`
3.  My previous code (second attempt) used `q1_sol2`. The `q_mycode` in the feedback matched results from this choice.
4.  If `q1_sol1` was used instead, the resulting `q1` was very close to `q1_corr`.
5.  Furthermore, if this `q1_sol1` was used to calculate `pwc_x_in_frame1`, and then `q2` was found using `q2 = atan2(pwc_x_in_frame1, pwc_z)`, this `q2` was very close to `q2_corr`.

This suggests that the primary issue was the selection of the `q1` branch. The original first attempt's `q1` logic (`q1 = theta_p - asin_val`) appears to be the one that aligns with the "correct" solutions provided in the feedback.

The proposed solution is to revert the `q1` calculation to this first form and keep the subsequent `q2` and `q3` calculations which depend on `q1`.

The steps are:
1.  Calculate the wrist center `P_wc = (pwc_x, pwc_y, pwc_z)` from the target TCP position and orientation.
2.  Define `K_val = d1y + d2y`.
3.  Calculate `R_xy = sqrt(pwc_x^2 + pwc_y^2)`.
4.  Calculate `theta_p = atan2(pwc_y, pwc_x)`.
5.  Calculate `val_for_asin = K_val / R_xy`. Ensure this value is clamped to `[-1.0, 1.0]` to prevent domain errors with `asin` due to potential floating-point inaccuracies.
6.  Calculate `asin_val = asin(val_for_asin)`.
7.  Set `q1 = theta_p - asin_val`.
8.  Transform `pwc_x` into Frame 1 (the frame after q1 rotation): `pwc_x_f1 = cos(q1)*pwc_x + sin(q1)*pwc_y`.
9.  Calculate `q2 = atan2(pwc_x_f1, pwc_z)`. Note that `pwc_z` is the z-coordinate of the wrist center in the base frame, which is also its z-coordinate in Frame 1.
10. Calculate `q3` using the matrix equation `Ry(q3) = Ry(-q2) * Rz(-q1) * R_tcp_base`. `q3` is then `atan2(M[0][2], M[0][0])` where `M` is the resulting matrix.

This approach provides a single, deterministic solution set `(q1, q2, q3)`.
