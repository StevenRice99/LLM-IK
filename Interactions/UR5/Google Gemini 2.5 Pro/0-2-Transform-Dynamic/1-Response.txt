To derive the inverse kinematics solution for the 3-DOF serial manipulator, we will combine and adapt the provided solutions for sub-chains. The overall strategy is:

1.  **Solve for Joint 1 (`theta1`):** Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis. We can determine `theta1` by considering the projection of the target TCP position `(px, py)` onto the XY plane. The approach from "EXISTING 1" (`theta1 = atan2(-px, py)`) effectively rotates the coordinate system such that the remaining problem for Joints 2 and 3 lies in a plane, simplifying calculations. After this rotation, the target's x-coordinate in the new frame (let's call it F1) becomes 0.

2.  **Transform Target Orientation to Frame F1:** The global target orientation `r = (rx, ry, rz)` (assumed to be RPY angles corresponding to ZYX Euler rotations: `R_global = Rz(rz)Ry(ry)Rx(rx)`) needs to be transformed into Frame F1. This is done by `R_target_F1 = RotZ(-theta1) * R_global`. The sum of Joint 2 and Joint 3 angles (`theta_sum_j2j3 = theta2 + theta3`) can then be found from the elements of `R_target_F1`, as `R_target_F1` should be equivalent to `RotY(theta2 + theta3)`. Specifically, `theta_sum_j2j3 = atan2(R_target_F1[0,2], R_target_F1[0,0])`.

3.  **Solve for Joints 2 and 3 (`theta2`, `theta3`):**
    *   **Target Position:** After the `theta1` rotation, the target position in Frame F1 is `(0, sqrt(px^2+py^2), pz)`. Joint 2's origin is offset from Frame F1's origin by `[0, 0.13585, 0]` along F1's Y-axis. The kinematic chain from Joint 2 onwards has a fixed Y-component due to the link offsets (`d_2_3[1] = -0.1197`). For the target to be reachable, `sqrt(px^2+py^2) - 0.13585` must equal `-0.1197`. The problem statement guarantees reachability, so this condition is assumed to hold.
    *   The problem for Joints 2 and 3 (both rotating around their Y-axes) becomes a 2D planar inverse kinematics problem in the XZ plane of Joint 2's base frame. The target coordinates for this planar problem are `(x_planar = 0, z_planar = pz)`.
    *   **Using "EXISTING 2" Logic:** The "EXISTING 2" solution is for a 2-link planar arm with link lengths `a = 0.425` (Z-component of Link 3) and `b = 0.39225` (Z-component of TCP). Its inputs are a target position `(x_target, z_target)` and an orientation `(rx, ry, rz)` from which it derives `theta_sum`.
        *   We will use `x_target_ex2 = 0.0` and `z_target_ex2 = pz`.
        *   The `theta_sum` for "EXISTING 2" will be our calculated `theta_sum_j2j3`. We can pass this by setting the `ry` component of its orientation input to `theta_sum_j2j3` and `rx, rz` to 0.
        *   The angles returned by "EXISTING 2" (`theta1_ex2`, `theta2_ex2`) will correspond to our `theta2` and `theta3`, respectively.

The joint limits are `[-2*pi, 2*pi]`, which are quite permissive and usually don't constrain the first solution found by `acos` or `atan2`.
