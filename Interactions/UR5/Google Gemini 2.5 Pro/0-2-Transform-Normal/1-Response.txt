To provide the closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the described 3-DOF serial manipulator, I will complete the Python function `inverse_kinematics`.

The robot's kinematic structure is as follows:
1.  Joint 1: Revolute around Z-axis (angle `q1`).
2.  Link 1 to Joint 2: Translation `d1 = [0, 0.13585, 0]`.
3.  Joint 2: Revolute around Y-axis (angle `q2`).
4.  Link 2 to Joint 3: Translation `d2 = [0, -0.1197, 0.425]`.
5.  Joint 3: Revolute around Y-axis (angle `q3`).
6.  Link 3 to TCP: Translation `d_tcp = [0, 0, 0.39225]`.

The constants derived from the "DETAILS" section are:
*   `a1 = d1[1] = 0.13585`
*   `a2 = d2[1] = -0.1197`
*   `l2 = d2[2] = 0.425` (This is the length component along Z in Link 2's frame, from Joint 2 to Joint 3)
*   `l3 = d_tcp[2] = 0.39225` (This is the length component along Z in Link 3's frame, from Joint 3 to TCP)

**Orientation:**
The orientation of the TCP is given by `R_tcp = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2) * Ry(q3) = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2+q3)`.
The target orientation is provided as Euler angles `r = [rx, ry, rz]`. Assuming this corresponds to `R_target = Rz(rz) * Ry(ry) * Rx(rx)`.
For `R_tcp = R_target`, and given the structure of `R_tcp`, `rx` must be 0. The problem states that all targets are reachable, so we assume `rx=0`.
Thus, `Rz(q1) * Ry(q2+q3) = Rz(rz) * Ry(ry)`.
This yields:
*   `q1 = rz` (from `r[2]`)
*   `q_sum = q2 + q3 = ry` (from `r[1]`)

**Position:**
The forward kinematics for the TCP position `P_E = [px, py, pz]` are:
`P_E = Rz(q1) * V`
where `V = [Vx, Vy, Vz]^T` is the position of the TCP in the frame after the `q1` rotation:
*   `Vx = l3*sin(q2+q3) + l2*sin(q2)`
*   `Vy = a1 + a2`
*   `Vz = l3*cos(q2+q3) + l2*cos(q2)`

Substituting `q_sum = q2+q3`:
*   `Vz = pz`
    `pz = l3*cos(q_sum) + l2*cos(q2)`
    `l2*cos(q2) = pz - l3*cos(q_sum)` (Equation 1)

From `P_E = Rz(q1) * V`:
*   `px = cos(q1)*Vx - sin(q1)*Vy`
*   `py = sin(q1)*Vx + cos(q1)*Vy`
Multiplying the first by `cos(q1)` and the second by `sin(q1)` and adding them gives:
*   `cos(q1)*px + sin(q1)*py = Vx`
Substituting `Vx = l3*sin(q_sum) + l2*sin(q2)`:
*   `cos(q1)*px + sin(q1)*py = l3*sin(q_sum) + l2*sin(q2)`
    `l2*sin(q2) = cos(q1)*px + sin(q1)*py - l3*sin(q_sum)` (Equation 2)

From Equation 1 and Equation 2, we can find `q2`:
*   `q2 = atan2( (cos(q1)*px + sin(q1)*py - l3*sin(q_sum)), (pz - l3*cos(q_sum)) )`
    Note: The `l2` in the denominator of `sin(q2)` and `cos(q2)` cancels out when using `atan2(numerator_for_sin, numerator_for_cos)`. This is valid as `l2 = 0.425 != 0`.

Finally, `q3` can be found:
*   `q3 = q_sum - q2`

The joint angles `(q1, q2, q3)` are returned in radians.
