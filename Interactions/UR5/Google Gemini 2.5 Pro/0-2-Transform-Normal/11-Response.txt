The feedback indicates that my previous selection logic for `(q2, q3)` was still not perfectly matching the "correct" solver's behavior in all cases. The key failing case showed that even if the principal solution for `q2` (and its corresponding `q3`) was valid and within joint limits, the "correct" solver preferred an alternative (`q2_principal + 2*pi` and its `q3`) because that alternative had a lower `abs(q2) + abs(q3)` cost.

This implies that the selection criterion is simpler:
1.  Calculate `q1` (robot's first joint angle) and `q_sum = q2 + q3` from the target orientation `r = [roll, pitch, yaw]`.
2.  Calculate the principal value for `q2` using `math.atan2`, let this be `q2_principal`.
3.  Generate three candidate `q2` values:
    *   `q2_cand_A = q2_principal`
    *   `q2_cand_B = q2_principal + 2*pi`
    *   `q2_cand_C = q2_principal - 2*pi`
4.  For each of these three `q2_candidates`:
    a.  Calculate the corresponding `q3_candidate = q_sum - q2_candidate`.
    b.  Check if both `q2_candidate` and `q3_candidate` are within the joint limits `[-2*pi, 2*pi]`.
    c.  If both are within limits, this `(q2_candidate, q3_candidate)` pair is a valid solution. Add it to a list of `valid_solutions_with_cost`, storing the pair and its cost: `abs(q2_candidate) + abs(q3_candidate)`.
5.  The problem guarantees that the list `valid_solutions_with_cost` will be non-empty.
6.  From `valid_solutions_with_cost`, select the solution pair `(q2, q3)` that has the minimum cost. This gives the final `q2` and `q3`.
7.  Return `(q1, q2_final, q3_final)`.

This approach considers all three potential `q2` configurations (differing by `2*pi`), filters them based on joint limits for both `q2` and `q3`, and then applies the cost minimization `min(abs(q2) + abs(q3))` to the resulting set of valid solutions.
