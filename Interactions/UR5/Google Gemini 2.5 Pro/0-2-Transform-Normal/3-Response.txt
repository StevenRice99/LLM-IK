To provide the closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics, I will complete the Python function `inverse_kinematics`. The solution involves first determining the primary rotation `q1` and the sum of the secondary rotations `q_sum = q2 + q3` from the target orientation `r = [roll, pitch, yaw]`. Then, `q2` is solved using the target position `p` and the previously found `q1` and `q_sum`. Finally, `q3` is found as `q_sum - q2`.

The robot's end-effector orientation `R_EE` is equivalent to `Rz(q1) * Ry(q_sum)`. The target orientation `r = [roll, pitch, yaw]` is assumed to correspond to an RPY convention `R_target = Rz(yaw) * Ry(pitch) * Rx(roll)`. For `R_EE` to match `R_target`, the element `R_target[2,1]` (0-indexed) must be zero. `R_target[2,1] = cos(pitch) * sin(roll)`. This implies that either `cos(pitch) = 0` (pitch is `+/- pi/2`, a gimbal lock scenario) or `sin(roll) = 0` (roll is `0` or `+/- pi`). The problem guarantees reachable targets.

The derivation distinguishes these cases:

1.  **Gimbal Lock** (`abs(cos(pitch))` is small, i.e., `pitch` is `+/- pi/2`):
    *   `q_sum_raw = pitch`
    *   If `pitch` is near `pi/2`: `q1_raw = yaw - roll`
    *   If `pitch` is near `-pi/2`: `q1_raw = yaw + roll`

2.  **Not Gimbal Lock** (`cos(pitch)` is not small, so `sin(roll)` must be small, i.e., `roll` is `0` or `+/-pi`):
    *   If `roll` is near `0`:
        *   `q1_raw = yaw`
        *   `q_sum_raw = pitch`
    *   If `roll` is near `+/-pi`:
        *   `q1_raw = yaw + pi`
        *   `q_sum_raw = pi - pitch`

The calculated `q1_raw` and `q_sum_raw` are then normalized to the range `[-pi, pi]` using `atan2(sin(angle), cos(angle))` to get `q1` and `q_sum`.

With `q1` and `q_sum`, the position equations are:
`px_rotated = cos(q1)*px + sin(q1)*py`
`pz_rotated = pz`
These correspond to the TCP position in a frame rotated by `q1` around Z.
In this frame (`F1` in derivation):
`Vx = l2*sin(q2) + l3*sin(q_sum)`
`Vy = a1 + a2` (This component is handled by the `px_rotated` term which effectively aligns the frame with `Vx`)
`Vz = l2*cos(q2) + l3*cos(q_sum)`

So:
`l2*sin(q2) = px_rotated - l3*sin(q_sum)`
`l2*cos(q2) = pz_rotated - l3*cos(q_sum)`

`q2` is then found using `atan2((px_rotated - l3*sin(q_sum)), (pz_rotated - l3*cos(q_sum)))`.
And `q3 = q_sum - q2`. `q3` is not further normalized, as example solutions show values outside `[-pi, pi]` but within joint limits.

The geometric constants are:
`a1 = 0.13585` (offset along Y from J1 to J2)
`a2 = -0.1197` (offset along Y in J2's frame to J3)
`l2 = 0.425` (offset along Z in J2's frame to J3)
`l3 = 0.39225` (offset along Z from J3 to TCP)
