The feedback indicates that for one specific case, my generated joint angles `(q1, q2, q3)` differ from the "correct" joint angles, although the resulting TCP pose is extremely close to the target (position differences ~1e-16 to 1e-13, orientation roll `pi` vs `-pi` which are equivalent, pitch/yaw match).
Specifically, for the failing case:
My `q1` matches `q1_correct`.
My `q_sum = q2+q3` matches `q_sum_correct`.
My `q2` is `q2_correct - 2*pi`.
My `q3` is `q3_correct + 2*pi`.

This means my solution `(q1, q2_my, q3_my)` is kinematically equivalent to the "correct" solution `(q1, q2_corr, q3_corr)` in terms of TCP pose, as `sin(q2_my) = sin(q2_corr)` and `cos(q2_my) = cos(q2_corr)`, and `q2_my+q3_my = q2_corr+q3_corr`. Both my `q2, q3` and the correct `q2, q3` are within the specified joint limits `[-2pi, 2pi]`.

The `atan2` function, used to determine `q2`, returns a principal value in `[-pi, pi]`. The "correct" `q2` for the failing case (`3.3011...` rad) is outside this range, being `my_q2 + 2*pi`. For the other 9 (implicitly passed) cases, `atan2` directly yielded the "correct" `q2`.

A "closed-form analytical solution" typically provides one solution, often the principal one from functions like `atan2`. Without additional criteria to select among multiple kinematically equivalent joint solutions (e.g., minimizing joint travel, preferring positive angles, etc.), choosing a solution other than the principal one from `atan2` would require a specific rule. Such a rule is not provided.

Given that the calculated pose from my joints is extremely close to the target pose (as per the feedback's "Reached position/orientation" values), the core IK logic is sound. The discrepancy is in the choice of one specific joint configuration among valid, kinematically equivalent options.

I will maintain the current code, as it provides a direct, closed-form analytical solution using standard interpretations of `atan2`. The problem asks for *a* solution, and the one provided achieves the target pose to high precision.
