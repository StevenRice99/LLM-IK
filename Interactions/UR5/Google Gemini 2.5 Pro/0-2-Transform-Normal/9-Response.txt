The feedback indicates that my previous solution, which used a cost function `min(abs(q2) + abs(q3))` to select among kinematically equivalent `(q2, q3)` pairs, correctly resolved 9 out of 10 test cases. However, it failed one specific case where the "correct" solution did not have the minimum `abs(q2) + abs(q3)` cost among the valid candidates.

In the failing case:
- Correct solution: `q1_c, q2_c, q3_c`
- My solution: `q1_m, q2_m, q3_m`
- `q1_m` matched `q1_c`.
- `q_sum_m = q2_m + q3_m` matched `q_sum_c = q2_c + q3_c`.
- `q2_c` was the principal value from `atan2(...)`.
- `q2_m` was `q2_c - 2*pi`.
- The `abs(q2)+abs(q3)` cost for my solution (`q2_m, q3_m`) was lower than for the correct solution (`q2_c, q3_c`).

This suggests a hierarchical selection criterion for `(q2, q3)`:
1.  **Prioritize the principal solution**: Calculate `q2_principal` using `atan2`. If `q2_principal` and its corresponding `q3_principal = q_sum - q2_principal` are both within joint limits (`[-2*pi, 2*pi]`), this is the chosen solution.
2.  **Fallback to alternatives**: If the principal solution is not fully within limits, then consider the alternative candidates for `q2`: `q2_principal + 2*pi` and `q2_principal - 2*pi`. From these alternatives that result in both `q2` and `q3` being within joint limits, select the one that minimizes the cost function `abs(q2) + abs(q3)`.

The problem statement guarantees that all targets are reachable, implying that at least one of these three configurations for `q2` (principal, principal + 2*pi, principal - 2*pi) will yield a `(q2, q3)` pair that is entirely within joint limits.

The implementation will:
- Calculate `q1` and `q_sum` from the target orientation.
- Calculate `q2_principal`.
- Form three candidate pairs for `(q2, q3)`:
    - `(q2_principal, q_sum - q2_principal)`
    - `(q2_principal + 2*pi, q_sum - (q2_principal + 2*pi))`
    - `(q2_principal - 2*pi, q_sum - (q2_principal - 2*pi))`
- Filter these candidates to find all pairs where both `q2` and `q3` are within joint limits. This list of `valid_solutions` is guaranteed to be non-empty.
- If the principal solution pair is among `valid_solutions`, select it.
- Otherwise (the principal solution was not valid due to limits), select from the remaining `valid_solutions` (which must be non-empty) based on the minimum `abs(q2) + abs(q3)` cost.
