To derive the inverse kinematics solution for the given 3-DOF serial manipulator, considering both position and orientation of the TCP, we will follow these steps:

**1. Define Robot Parameters:**
From the "DETAILS" section:
*   L1y = 0.13585 (Offset from Joint 1 to Joint 2 along local Y of Joint 1's frame, but Joint 2 is at [0, 0.13585, 0] relative to Joint 1, and Joint 1 rotates about Z. So this is effectively a translation along Y in the frame *before* Joint 1's Z rotation if we consider J1 origin fixed, or along Y in J1's frame after Z rotation if J1 is at origin).
    Let's clarify the forward kinematics chain based on the provided table:
    *   Joint 1 (Revolute Z) at origin [0,0,0].
    *   Joint 2 (Revolute Y) is at [0, 0.13585, 0] in Link 1's frame.
    *   Joint 3 (Revolute Y) is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] in Link 2's frame.
    *   TCP is at [0, 0, 0.39225] in Link 3's frame.

Let:
*   `d1y = 0.13585` (y-offset from J1 to J2 in J1's frame)
*   `d2y = -0.1197` (y-offset from J2 to J3 in J2's frame)
*   `d2z = 0.425` (z-offset from J2 to J3 in J2's frame)
*   `d3z = 0.39225` (z-offset from J3 to TCP in J3's frame)

**2. Target Orientation (Rotation Matrix):**
The input orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw) = (phi, theta, psi)` is given in radians. We convert this to a target rotation matrix `R_target`. Assuming ZYX extrinsic convention (Rz(psi) * Ry(theta) * Rx(phi)):
Let `phi = r[0]`, `theta = r[1]`, `psi = r[2]`.
`cphi = cos(phi)`, `sphi = sin(phi)`
`cth = cos(theta)`, `sth = sin(theta)`
`cpsi = cos(psi)`, `spsi = sin(psi)`

`R_target = [[cpsi*cth, cpsi*sth*sphi - spsi*cphi, cpsi*sth*cphi + spsi*sphi],
             [spsi*cth, spsi*sth*sphi + cpsi*cphi, spsi*sth*cphi - cpsi*sphi],
             [-sth,     cth*sphi,                  cth*cphi                 ]]`

**3. Robot End-Effector Orientation:**
The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sequence of joint rotations: `R_0_TCP = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2) * Ry(q3)`.
Let `c1=cos(q1), s1=sin(q1)`, etc.
Let `q23 = q2 + q3`. Then `R_0_TCP = Rz(q1) * Ry(q23)`.
`R_0_TCP = [[c1*cos(q23), -s1, c1*sin(q23)],
            [s1*cos(q23),  c1, s1*sin(q23)],
            [-sin(q23),    0,  cos(q23)  ]]`

**4. Solve for q1 and q2+q3 (S_q23):**
Equating `R_target` with `R_0_TCP`:
`r12 = -s1`
`r22 = c1`
`r32 = 0` (This implies `cth*sphi = 0`. Since the target is assumed reachable, this condition holds.)

From `r12` and `r22`:
`q1 = atan2(-r12, r22)`

From `r31` and `r33`:
`r31 = -sin(q23)`
`r33 = cos(q23)`
`S_q23 = q2 + q3 = atan2(-r31, r33)`

Let `s_S_q23 = sin(S_q23)` and `c_S_q23 = cos(S_q23)`.

**5. Forward Kinematics for Position:**
Let `(Px, Py, Pz) = p`.
The position of Joint 2 (P_J2) in base frame:
`P_J2 = Rz(q1) * [0, d1y, 0]^T = [-s1*d1y, c1*d1y, 0]^T`

The position of Joint 3 (P_J3) in base frame:
`P_J3 = P_J2 + Rz(q1)*Ry(q2) * [0, d2y, d2z]^T`
`Rz(q1)*Ry(q2) = [[c1c2, -s1, c1s2], [s1c2, c1, s1s2], [-s2, 0, c2]]`
`P_J3_x = -s1*d1y + (-s1*d2y + c1s2*d2z)`
`P_J3_y =  c1*d1y + ( c1*d2y + s1s2*d2z)`
`P_J3_z =                         c2*d2z`

The position of TCP (P_TCP) in base frame:
`P_TCP = P_J3 + Rz(q1)*Ry(q2)*Ry(q3) * [0, 0, d3z]^T`
`P_TCP = P_J3 + R_0_TCP * [0, 0, d3z]^T` (using R_0_TCP with q23)
`P_TCP_x = P_J3_x + c1*s_S_q23*d3z`
`P_TCP_y = P_J3_y + s1*s_S_q23*d3z`
`P_TCP_z = P_J3_z + c_S_q23*d3z`

Substituting P_J3 components:
`Px = -s1*d1y - s1*d2y + c1s2*d2z + c1*s_S_q23*d3z`
   `= -s1*(d1y+d2y) + c1*(s2*d2z + s_S_q23*d3z)`
`Py =  c1*d1y + c1*d2y + s1s2*d2z + s1*s_S_q23*d3z`
   `=  c1*(d1y+d2y) + s1*(s2*d2z + s_S_q23*d3z)`
`Pz = c2*d2z + c_S_q23*d3z`

**6. Solve for q2:**
From the `Pz` equation:
`c2*d2z = Pz - c_S_q23*d3z`
`c2 = (Pz - c_S_q23*d3z) / d2z` (assuming `d2z != 0`, which is true: 0.425)

From `Px` and `Py` equations:
Let `A = d1y + d2y`
Let `B = s2*d2z + s_S_q23*d3z`
`Px = -s1*A + c1*B`
`Py =  c1*A + s1*B`
Multiply first by `c1`, second by `s1` and add:
`c1*Px + s1*Py = -s1c1*A + c1^2*B + s1c1*A + s1^2*B = (c1^2+s1^2)*B = B`
So, `B = c1*Px + s1*Py`
`s2*d2z + s_S_q23*d3z = c1*Px + s1*Py`
`s2*d2z = c1*Px + s1*Py - s_S_q23*d3z`
`s2 = (c1*Px + s1*Py - s_S_q23*d3z) / d2z`

Now we have `s2` and `c2`:
`q2 = atan2(s2, c2)`

**7. Solve for q3:**
`q3 = S_q23 - q2`

The joint values `(q1, q2, q3)` are in radians.

Testing the provided "EXISTING" solution's constants:
`k = 0.01615`
`L1y = 0.13585` (my `d1y`)
`L2y = -0.1197` (my `d2y`)
`d1y + d2y = 0.13585 - 0.1197 = 0.01615`. This matches `k`.

The existing solution's `numerator_cosθ3 = x ** 2 + y ** 2 + z ** 2 - 0.334746`
`0.3334125`
My `d2z = 0.425`, `d3z = 0.39225`
`d2z^2 = 0.180625`
`d3z^2 = 0.1538505625`
`(d1y+d2y)^2 = k^2 = 0.0002608225`
`d2z^2 + d3z^2 + (d1y+d2y)^2 = 0.180625 + 0.1538505625 + 0.0002608225 = 0.334736385` (This is the `0.334746` term, likely `d2z^2 + d3z^2 + (d1y+d2y)^2` or similar sum of squares of effective link lengths).
`2 * d2z * d3z = 2 * 0.425 * 0.39225 = 0.3334125`. This is the divisor for `cosθ3`.
The existing solution uses a law-of-cosines approach for a 2-link arm (lengths `d2z`, `d3z`) in the plane defined by `q2` and `q3`, after `q1` positions the base of this 2-link arm. `θ3` in their solution likely corresponds to my `q3` or an angle related to it.

My solution decouples orientation first (q1, q2+q3), then solves for q2 and q3 using position. This is a standard approach when orientation is fully specified.

A note on clamping `s2` and `c2`:
If `abs(c2_numerator / d2z)` is slightly > 1 due to floating point errors, `math.acos(c2)` would fail. Clamping `c2` to `[-1, 1]` is a good practice. Similarly for `s2` if it were used to find `q2` via `asin`. `atan2(s2, c2)` is generally more robust as it handles signs correctly and `s2, c2` don't strictly need to form a perfect unit vector for `atan2` to give an angle, though the closer they are to satisfying `s2^2+c2^2=1`, the more accurate the result. The derivation ensures they should satisfy this if Px,Py,Pz is reachable with the given q1 and S_q23.

Final check on the derivation of `s2` and `c2`:
`c2 = (Pz - c_S_q23*d3z) / d2z`
`s2 = (c1*Px + s1*Py - s_S_q23*d3z) / d2z`
These seem correct and directly derived.

One final thought: the problem states "Link 2 | [0, 0.13585, 0] | [0, 0, 0] | Y". This means the origin of Link 2's coordinate system (where joint 2 acts) is translated by [0, 0.13585, 0] relative to Link 1's coordinate system.
My `d1y` is this translation.
"Link 3 | [0, -0.1197, 0.425] | [0, 0, 0] | Y". Origin of Link 3 (where joint 3 acts) is translated by `[0, d2y, d2z]` relative to Link 2's system.
"TCP | [0, 0, 0.39225] | [0, 0, 0]". TCP is translated by `[0, 0, d3z]` relative to Link 3's system.
The kinematic chain for position seems correctly interpreted.

The orientation `R_0_TCP = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2) * Ry(q3)` is also standard for this Z-Y-Y joint sequence where each rotation is about the new local axis.

The solution appears solid.
