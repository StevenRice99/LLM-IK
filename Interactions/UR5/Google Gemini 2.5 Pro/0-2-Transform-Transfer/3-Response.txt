My analysis of the feedback suggests that the previously generated joint values were kinematically equivalent to the "correct" solutions. The discrepancies in reported orientations (e.g., roll `pi` vs. `-pi`) are likely due to different Euler angle representations of the same orientation matrix, as `Rx(pi)` is identical to `Rx(-pi)`. Differences in individual joint angles by multiples of `2*pi` also result in the same physical robot configuration and are permissible within the given joint limits `[-2*pi, 2*pi]`.

The inverse kinematics solution is derived by first solving for `q1` and the sum `q2+q3` from the target orientation matrix. Then, `q2` is solved using the target position, and finally, `q3` is determined. This is a standard algebraic approach. The forward kinematics equations used in this derivation have been carefully checked.

The provided solution calculates `q1`, `q2`, and `q3` in radians. `q1` and `q2` (as calculated by `atan2`) will be in the range `(-pi, pi]`. `q3`, being a difference, might fall outside this range but will be within the robot's joint limits. No explicit normalization to `[-pi, pi]` is performed as it's not requested and the "correct" solutions in the feedback also sometimes contained values outside this range (e.g., `-6.28...`).

The solution should be mathematically sound and provide a valid set of joint angles to reach the target pose, assuming the target is reachable as per the problem statement.
