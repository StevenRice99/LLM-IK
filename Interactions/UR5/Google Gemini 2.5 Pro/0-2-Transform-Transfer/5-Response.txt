The provided feedback indicates that while the TCP pose (position and orientation) achieved by my code is extremely close to the target pose (and also to the pose achieved by the "correct" joint values), the individual joint values for `q2` and `q3` sometimes differ from the "correct" ones.

Upon detailed analysis of the examples:
1.  `q1` (joint 1) from my code consistently matches the "correct" `q1`.
2.  The sum `S_q23 = q2 + q3` derived from my code also consistently matches the sum derived from the "correct" `q2` and `q3`.
3.  The discrepancy arises in the individual values of `q2` and `q3`. Specifically, my `q2` (calculated using `atan2(s2_val, c2_val)`) is always in the range `(-pi, pi]`. In cases where my `q2` differs from the "correct" `q2`, the "correct" `q2` is equal to `my_q2 + 2k*pi` (where `k` is an integer, typically 1 in the examples shown). Consequently, the "correct" `q3` is `my_q3 - 2k*pi`.

This means both my solution and the "correct" solution are kinematically equivalent: they achieve the same TCP orientation and position because adding `2*pi` to a revolute joint angle results in the same physical orientation of that link, and the subsequent calculation of `q3` maintains the required sum `S_q23`. The joint limits `[-2pi, 2pi]` allow for these multiple equivalent solutions.

The `atan2` function returns a principal value for the angle. The problem does not specify a criterion for choosing among multiple kinematically equivalent solutions (e.g., by preferring a certain range for `q2` or `q3` beyond what `atan2` provides, or by minimizing/maximizing a joint angle). My solution finds *a* valid set of joint angles.

The forward kinematics derivation for `s2_val` and `c2_val`, and the subsequent use of `atan2`, are standard and appear correct. The target orientation matrix and its use to find `q1` and `S_q23` also seem correct.

Given that the problem asks for *an* analytical solution and assumes targets are reachable, the provided code fulfills this by finding a valid set of joint angles. The differences noted in the feedback are due to the inherent multiplicity of solutions in inverse kinematics related to `2*pi` periodicity of joint angles, not an error in reaching the target pose itself.

Therefore, I will provide the same code again, as it correctly solves the inverse kinematics problem by providing one valid set of joint angles.
