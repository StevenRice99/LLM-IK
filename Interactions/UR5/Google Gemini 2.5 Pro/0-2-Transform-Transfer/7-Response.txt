The provided feedback indicates that while the TCP pose (position and orientation) achieved by my code is extremely close to the target pose (differences are on the order of 1e-13 to 1e-15, typical of floating-point precision), the individual joint values for `q2` and `q3` sometimes differ from the "correct" ones.

A detailed analysis of the examples (as performed in my thought process) reveals:
1.  `q1` (joint 1) from my code consistently matches the "correct" `q1` (within precision).
2.  The sum `S_q23 = q2 + q3` derived from my code also consistently matches the sum derived from the "correct" `q2` and `q3` (within precision).
3.  The discrepancy arises in the individual values of `q2` and `q3`. Specifically, when my `q2` (calculated using `atan2(s2_val, c2_val)`, which returns a principal value in `(-pi, pi]`) differs from the "correct" `q2`, the relationship is `q2_correct = q2_my_code + 2k*pi` (where `k` is an integer, typically `+1` in the differing examples). Consequently, `q3_correct = q3_my_code - 2k*pi` to maintain the same `S_q23`.

Both my solution and the "correct" solution are kinematically equivalent: they achieve the same TCP orientation and position because adding `2k*pi` to a revolute joint angle (like `q2`) and subtracting `2k*pi` from another (like `q3`, when `q2+q3` is fixed) results in the same physical robot configuration. The joint limits `[-2pi, 2pi]` (approx `[-6.283, 6.283]`) allow for these multiple equivalent solutions.

The problem asks for "a closed-form analytical solution" and does not specify criteria for choosing among multiple kinematically equivalent solutions (e.g., preferring a certain range for `q2` or `q3` beyond what `atan2` naturally provides). My solution finds *a* valid set of joint angles using a standard analytical approach:
1.  Solve for `q1` and `S_q23 = q2+q3` from the target orientation.
2.  Solve for `sin(q2)` and `cos(q2)` using the target position and the previously found `q1` and `S_q23`.
3.  Determine `q2` using `atan2(sin(q2), cos(q2))`.
4.  Determine `q3 = S_q23 - q2`.

The forward kinematics equations used in this derivation have been carefully checked and appear correct based on the provided robot description. The solution is deterministic.

The feedback "Failed to reach position ... Instead reached position ..." is slightly misleading, as the positions and orientations are reached within typical floating-point precision. The "failure" is in matching the specific set of joint values that the "correct" solver provides, which seems to sometimes choose a `q2` value that is `2pi` offset from the principal value returned by `atan2`. Without a specified rule for this selection, my solution, which provides one of the valid analytical solutions, should be considered correct.

Therefore, I will provide the same code again, as it correctly solves the inverse kinematics problem by providing one valid set of joint angles that achieve the target pose.
