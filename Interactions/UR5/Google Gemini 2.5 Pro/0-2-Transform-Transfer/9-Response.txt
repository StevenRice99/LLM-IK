The core issue identified from the repeated feedback is that while my inverse kinematics solution produces joint angles that achieve the target TCP pose (position and orientation) within floating-point precision, the specific values for `q2` and `q3` sometimes differ from the "correct" joint values provided by the testing environment. This difference is consistently of the form `q2_correct = q2_my_code + n*2pi` and `q3_correct = q3_my_code - n*2pi` for some integer `n` (typically `n=0, 1,` or `-1` in the examples). This means both sets of joint angles are kinematically equivalent.

My analytical solution follows these steps:
1.  Calculate the target orientation matrix `R_target` from the input Euler angles `(phi, theta, psi)`.
2.  Solve for `q1` and the sum `S_q23 = q2 + q3` by comparing `R_target` with the robot's symbolic end-effector orientation matrix `R_0_E = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2+q3)`. This yields unique `q1` and `S_q23` (within `(-pi, pi]`) using `atan2`.
3.  Derive expressions for `sin(q2)` and `cos(q2)` using the target position `(Px, Py, Pz)` and the already determined `q1` and `S_q23`. The forward kinematics equations used are:
    *   `Px_tcp = c1*(s2*d2z + sin(S_q23)*d3z) - s1*(d1y+d2y)`
    *   `Py_tcp = s1*(s2*d2z + sin(S_q23)*d3z) + c1*(d1y+d2y)`
    *   `Pz_tcp = c2*d2z + cos(S_q23)*d3z`
    Rearranging these gives:
    *   `cos(q2) = (Pz - cos(S_q23)*d3z) / d2z`
    *   `sin(q2) = ((c1*Px + s1*Py) - sin(S_q23)*d3z) / d2z`
4.  Calculate `q2 = atan2(sin(q2), cos(q2))`. This provides a unique value for `q2` in the range `(-pi, pi]`.
5.  Calculate `q3 = S_q23 - q2`.

This method provides one valid, closed-form analytical solution. The problem statement asks for "a" solution and does not specify any criteria for choosing among multiple kinematically equivalent solutions (which arise due to the `2*pi` periodicity of revolute joints and are permissible within the given joint limits of `[-2pi, 2pi]`).

The "correct" solver used by the testing environment appears to apply an unstated rule to select a specific `n` (for the `n*2pi` offset). Without knowing this rule, my code provides the solution corresponding to `n=0` for `q2` relative to its principal `atan2` value.

Since the solution correctly achieves the target pose and is a valid analytical result, I submit the same code.
