To derive the inverse kinematics solution for the 4-DOF serial manipulator, we will follow these steps:

1.  **Calculate TCP Orientation Matrix and Wrist Center Position**:
    *   The target TCP orientation `r = (rx, ry, rz)` (roll, pitch, yaw) is given in radians. We form the rotation matrix `R_tcp_world` assuming RPY convention: `R_tcp_world = Rz(rz) * Ry(ry) * Rx(rx)`.
    *   The TCP is offset from Link 4's origin by `v_L4_TCP = [0, 0.093, 0]`.
    *   The wrist center `P_w` (origin of Joint 4) is calculated as `P_w = p_tcp - R_tcp_world @ v_L4_TCP`. Let `P_w = (Pwx, Pwy, Pwz)`.

2.  **Solve for Joint 1 (theta1)**:
    *   Joint 1 rotates around the Z-axis. The sum of Y-offsets from Joint 1's origin to the TCP, when projected into the arm's plane (rotated by `theta1`), is:
        `Y_arm_plane_offset = d_J1_J2_y + d_J2_J3_y + d_J3_J4_y + d_J4_TCP_y`
        `Y_arm_plane_offset = 0.13585 + (-0.1197) + 0 + 0.093 = 0.10915` meters.
    *   The Y-coordinate of the TCP in the world frame `py` can be related to `theta1` and `Y_arm_plane_offset`:
        `py * cos(theta1) - px * sin(theta1) = Y_arm_plane_offset`
        where `(px, py, pz)` is the target TCP position.
    *   This equation can be solved for `theta1`. Let `A = py`, `B = -px`, `C = Y_arm_plane_offset`.
        `sqrt(A^2 + B^2) * cos(theta1 - atan2(B, A)) = C`.
        `cos_val = C / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)`. Ensure `abs(cos_val) <= 1`.
        `theta1 = atan2(B, A) +/- acos(cos_val)`. This yields two potential solutions for `theta1`.

3.  **For each `theta1` solution**:
    *   **Verify Orientation Compatibility**:
        The combined rotation of Joints 2, 3, and 4 are around their local Y-axes. This means that when the arm is viewed in the frame rotated by `theta1` (Frame F1), the orientation of Link 4 (and thus the TCP) must be a pure Y-rotation.
        Let `R_F1_TCP = Rz(-theta1) @ R_tcp_world`.
        Check if `R_F1_TCP` is a pure Y-rotation matrix (i.e., elements `R_F1_TCP[0,1]`, `R_F1_TCP[1,0]`, `R_F1_TCP[1,2]`, `R_F1_TCP[2,1]` are close to 0, and `R_F1_TCP[1,1]` is close to 1). If not, this `theta1` solution is invalid.
    *   **Calculate Sum of Joint Angles (theta2+theta3+theta4)**:
        If `R_F1_TCP` is a Y-rotation `Ry(beta)`, then `beta = atan2(R_F1_TCP[0,2], R_F1_TCP[0,0])`.
        So, `theta2 + theta3 + theta4 = beta`.
    *   **Solve for Joints 2 and 3 (theta2, theta3) using 2R Planar IK**:
        *   The target for the 2R planar arm (formed by Links 2-3 and 3-4) is the wrist center `P_w` projected into Frame F1 and made relative to Joint 2's origin.
            Joint 2's origin in Frame F1 is `(0, d_J1_J2_y, 0) = (0, 0.13585, 0)`.
            `P_w_F1x = Pwx * cos(theta1) + Pwy * sin(theta1)`
            `P_w_F1z = Pwz`
            The effective target for the 2R arm (lengths `L2z`, `L3z`) relative to Joint 2's origin is:
            `x_eff = P_w_F1x`
            `z_eff = P_w_F1z`
        *   Link lengths for the planar IK:
            `L2z = 0.425` (Z-component of J2-J3 link)
            `L3z = 0.39225` (Z-component of J3-J4 link)
        *   Solve for `theta3`:
            `cos_theta3 = (x_eff^2 + z_eff^2 - L2z^2 - L3z^2) / (2 * L2z * L3z)`.
            Ensure `abs(cos_theta3) <= 1`.
            `theta3` can have two solutions: `acos(cos_theta3)` and `-acos(cos_theta3)`.
        *   For each `theta3` solution, solve for `theta2`:
            `theta2 = atan2(x_eff, z_eff) - atan2(L3z * sin(theta3), L2z + L3z * cos(theta3))`.
            (This assumes `theta2` is the angle of the first link L2z from the Z-axis, and `theta3` is the relative angle of L3z).
    *   **Solve for Joint 4 (theta4)**:
        `theta4 = beta - theta2 - theta3`.
    *   **Check Joint Limits**:
        All calculated joint angles `(theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)` must be within their limits `[-2*pi, 2*pi]`.
        Angles from `atan2` are in `[-pi, pi]`. `acos` is in `[0, pi]`. `theta4` might need to be checked carefully. If any angle is outside the limits, this solution branch is invalid.
    *   **Return First Valid Solution**: The problem asks for one solution.

The implementation will use `numpy` for matrix operations and math functions.
