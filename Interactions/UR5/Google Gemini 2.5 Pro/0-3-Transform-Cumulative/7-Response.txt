The primary challenge appears to be selecting the specific solution (out of multiple valid kinematic solutions) that the evaluation harness expects. The core geometric equations are likely correct, as indicated by the "Instead reached position" being very close to the target. The discrepancies arise from choices in:
1.  The two solutions for `theta1` (from `+/- acos`).
2.  The two solutions for `theta3` (elbow up/down, from `+/- acos`).
3.  The `2pi` equivalent chosen for each joint angle to satisfy limits `[-2pi, 2pi]`.

My previous attempts used a systematic exploration of `2pi` candidates for each joint, sorted numerically. This means if multiple `2pi` equivalents were valid for a joint, the most negative one would be tried first. If the reference solution used a different (e.g., more positive) equivalent, my code might return a different, though kinematically valid, solution if that branch was completed first.

Based on the first failure case in the last feedback:
Correct `J_corr = [-0.641, -0.260, -0.504, -2.147]`
My code produced `J_mine = [-0.641, -0.744, -5.778, -2.672]`
Here, `t1` matches. `t3_corr = -0.504` corresponds to `-acos_val`. My `t3_mine = -5.778` corresponds to `acos_val - 2pi`. This suggests my code explored the `acos_val` branch for `theta3` first, found a solution with one of its `2pi` variants, and returned. If it had explored the `-acos_val` branch for `theta3` first, it might have found the correct `t3 = -0.504`.

I will adjust the order of preference for the two base solutions of `theta3`:
1.  Try `t3_base = -acos(val)` first.
2.  Then try `t3_base = acos(val)`.

The candidate generation for `2pi` equivalents for each joint angle will remain:
   a. Take the raw calculated angle (`val_raw`).
   b. Also consider its normalization to `[-pi, pi]` (`val_norm_mpi_pi`).
   c. From these two base values (`val_raw`, `val_norm_mpi_pi`), generate further candidates by adding/subtracting `2pi`.
   d. Collect all unique candidates, filter them by joint limits `[-2pi, 2pi]`, and iterate through them in numerically sorted order. This ensures deterministic behavior.

The overall nested loop structure will iterate through these choices and return the first complete set of four joint angles that are all within limits.
