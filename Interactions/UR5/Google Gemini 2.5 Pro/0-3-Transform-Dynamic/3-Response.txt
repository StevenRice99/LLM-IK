Okay, I've analyzed the feedback and the robot's geometry. The previous approach for `j1` was too simplistic and assumed that the projection of the target onto J1's XY plane would have its X-coordinate become zero, and that the resulting Y-coordinate would match a fixed offset. This is only true if `sqrt(px^2+py^2)` happens to equal that fixed offset.

The corrected approach is as follows:

1.  **Calculate `j1` (Joint 1 - Z-axis rotation):**
    *   The TCP has a fixed Y-offset in J1's frame (Frame 1) due to the sum of Y-components of links J2, J3, J4, and TCP. This offset is `Y_req = J2_pos_y + J3_pos_y_in_J2 + J4_pos_y_in_J3 + TCP_pos_y_in_J4 = 0.13585 - 0.1197 + 0 + 0.093 = 0.10915`.
    *   In Frame 1 (after J1 rotation `j1`), the target's Y-coordinate `py_f1` must equal `Y_req`.
        `py_f1 = -px * sin(j1) + py * cos(j1) = Y_req`.
    *   This equation is solved for `j1`. Let `H = sqrt(px^2 + py^2)`.
        `j1 = atan2(-px, py) +/- acos(Y_req / H)`.
    *   We'll choose one solution: `j1 = atan2(-px, py) + acos(clip(Y_req / H, -1.0, 1.0))`. `clip` ensures the argument to `acos` is valid.

2.  **Determine Planar Arm Target:**
    *   Once `j1` is found, transform the target `(px, py)` into Frame 1 to get the target for the planar arm (J2, J3, J4).
        `x_planar = px * cos(j1) + py * sin(j1)`
        `z_planar = pz_world` (The world Z-coordinate is the Z-coordinate in Frame 1 and for the planar arm operating in J2's base XZ plane).

3.  **Solve for `j3` (Joint 3 - Y-axis rotation, "elbow" of planar arm):**
    *   The planar arm consists of effective link lengths `L1 = 0.425` (J2-J3 Z-component) and `L2 = 0.39225` (J3-J4 Z-component).
    *   The distance squared to the planar target is `d_sq = x_planar^2 + z_planar^2`.
    *   Using the law of cosines: `cos(j3) = (d_sq - L1^2 - L2^2) / (2 * L1 * L2)`.
    *   We'll choose `j3 = acos(clip(cos(j3), -1.0, 1.0))`. This yields `j3` in `[0, pi]`.

4.  **Solve for `j2` (Joint 2 - Y-axis rotation, "base" of planar arm):**
    *   With `j3`, `x_planar`, and `z_planar` known, `j2` is found using standard 2-link planar inverse kinematics:
        Let `C = L1 + L2*cos(j3)` and `D = L2*sin(j3)`.
        The denominator for `sin(j2)` and `cos(j2)` is `denom_j2 = d_sq`. (Note: `d_sq` should be `C^2+D^2`).
        `sin(j2) = (C*x_planar - D*z_planar) / denom_j2`
        `cos(j2) = (D*x_planar + C*z_planar) / denom_j2`
        `j2 = atan2(sin(j2), cos(j2))`.

5.  **Solve for `j4` (Joint 4 - Y-axis rotation, orientation):**
    *   The target orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)` is used to form the target rotation matrix `R_target_world = Rz(yaw)Ry(pitch)Rx(roll)`.
    *   Transform this to J2's base frame (Frame 1): `R_j2_base = RotZ(-j1) * R_target_world`.
    *   The combined rotation of the planar arm (J2, J3, J4) around their Y-axes is `Ry(j2+j3+j4)`.
    *   From `R_j2_base` (which should equal `Ry(j2+j3+j4)`):
        `sum_angles = j2+j3+j4 = atan2(R_j2_base[0,2], R_j2_base[0,0])`.
    *   `j4 = sum_angles - j2 - j3`.

6.  **Normalization:**
    *   All joint angles `(j1, j2, j3, j4)` are normalized to the range `[-pi, pi]`.

This refined approach directly addresses the geometric constraints and matches the first successful example from the feedback.
