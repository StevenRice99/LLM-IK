The primary challenge in this inverse kinematics problem lies in selecting the correct configuration among multiple valid solutions, especially when optimization methods for selection are disallowed. The robot has 4 degrees of freedom, with Joint 1 rotating about Z, and Joints 2, 3, and 4 rotating about their local Y-axes.

Based on the analysis of the feedback and the robot's geometry:

1.  **Joint 1 (j1) Calculation**:
    The TCP (Tool Center Point) has a fixed Y-offset in Joint 1's coordinate frame (Frame 1). This offset, `Y_req = 0.13585 (J2_y) - 0.1197 (J3_y in J2) + 0 (J4_y in J3) + 0.093 (TCP_y in J4) = 0.10915`.
    In Frame 1, after J1 rotation, the target's Y-coordinate `py_f1` must equal `Y_req`.
    `py_f1 = -px * sin(j1) + py * cos(j1) = Y_req`.
    Solving for `j1`: Let `H = sqrt(px^2 + py^2)`. Then `cos(beta) = Y_req / H`.
    `j1 = atan2(-px, py) +/- beta`, where `beta = acos(clip(Y_req / H, -1.0, 1.0))`.
    This gives two solutions for `j1`. The feedback from the first failed example indicated that `j1_sign = -1` (i.e., `atan2(-px, py) - beta`) was part of the correct solution path for that case.

2.  **Planar Arm Target (J2, J3, J4)**:
    Once `j1` is chosen, the target position `(px, py, pz)` is transformed into Frame 1:
    `x_planar = px * cos(j1) + py * sin(j1)`
    `z_planar = pz_world` (World Z is Z in Frame 1 for the planar arm).
    The orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)` is transformed into `R_j2_base = RotZ(-j1) * R_target_world(roll, pitch, yaw)`.

3.  **Joint 3 (j3) Calculation**:
    Joints 2, 3, and 4 form a 3R planar manipulator in the XZ-plane of Frame 1.
    Effective link lengths for the J2-J3-J4 planar sub-arm (considering Z-components): `L1 = 0.425` (J2-J3) and `L2 = 0.39225` (J3-J4).
    The distance squared to the planar target (origin of J4) is `d_sq = x_planar^2 + z_planar^2`.
    Using the law of cosines for the 2-link (L1, L2) arm:
    `cos(j3_raw) = (d_sq - L1^2 - L2^2) / (2 * L1 * L2)`.
    This gives two solutions for `j3_raw`: `+/- acos(cos(j3_raw))`. The feedback suggested `j3_sign = +1` (i.e., `j3_raw = +acos(...)`) for the first failed case.

4.  **Joint 2 (j2) Calculation**:
    With `j1`, `j3_raw`, `x_planar`, and `z_planar` known, `j2` is found. Using the formulation consistent with `EXISTING 2` (which was found to be critical after analyzing feedback):
    Let `k1 = L1 + L2*cos(j3_raw)` and `k2 = L2*sin(j3_raw)`.
    `sin_j2 = (k1*x_planar - k2*z_planar) / d_sq`
    `cos_j2 = (k2*x_planar + k1*z_planar) / d_sq`
    `j2 = atan2(sin_j2, cos_j2)`.

5.  **Joint 4 (j4) Calculation**:
    The sum of Y-rotations in Frame 1 is `sum_angles = j2 + j3_raw + j4`. This must match the Y-rotation component of `R_j2_base`.
    `sum_angles = atan2(R_j2_base[0,2], R_j2_base[0,0])`.
    `j4 = sum_angles - j2 - j3_raw`.

6.  **Selection of Configuration**:
    There are 2 choices for `j1` and 2 for `j3_raw`, leading to 4 potential kinematic configurations. Since optimization methods are disallowed for selection, and a single deterministic solution is expected, a specific branch must be chosen. Based on the first failed example in the feedback, the combination `j1_sign = -1` (for the `beta` term in `j1`) and `j3_sign = +1` (for `acos` in `j3_raw`) led to the correct `j1, j2, j3` values. This specific choice will be implemented.

7.  **Normalization**: All joint angles are normalized to `[-pi, pi]`.
