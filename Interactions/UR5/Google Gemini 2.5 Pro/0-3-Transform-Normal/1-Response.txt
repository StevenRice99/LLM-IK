To derive the inverse kinematics solution for the given 4-DOF serial manipulator, we will follow a geometric and algebraic approach. The goal is to find the joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4) that achieve a target TCP position `p = (px, py, pz)` and orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)`.

**Robot Structure and Parameters:**
Let's define the link parameters based on the provided details:
- `L0y = 0.13585`: Offset from Joint 1's frame to Joint 2's origin, along Joint 1's Y-axis.
- `l2y = -0.1197`: Offset from Joint 2's frame to Joint 3's origin, along Joint 2's Y-axis.
- `l2z = 0.425`: Offset from Joint 2's frame to Joint 3's origin, along Joint 2's Z-axis.
- `l3z = 0.39225`: Offset from Joint 3's frame to Joint 4's origin, along Joint 3's Z-axis. (Joint 4's origin is the wrist center).
- `TCP_offset_y = 0.093`: Offset from Joint 4's frame (wrist center) to the TCP, along Joint 4's Y-axis.

The joint axes are:
- q1: Revolute around Z-axis of the base frame.
- q2: Revolute around Y-axis of Joint 2's frame.
- q3: Revolute around Y-axis of Joint 3's frame.
- q4: Revolute around Y-axis of Joint 4's frame.

The TCP orientation is specified as [0,0,0] relative to Link 4's frame. This means the orientation of Link 4's frame is the target TCP orientation.

**Inverse Kinematics Steps:**

1.  **Calculate Target Rotation Matrix (R_target):**
    The input orientation `r = (roll, pitch, yaw)` is converted into a 3x3 rotation matrix `R_target`. We assume the RPY convention is Rz(yaw)Ry(pitch)Rx(roll).
    `R_target = [[r11, r12, r13], [r21, r22, r23], [r31, r32, r33]]`

2.  **Calculate Wrist Center Position (P_wc):**
    The wrist center (P_wc) is the origin of Link 4. The TCP is offset from P_wc by `TCP_offset_y` along the Y-axis of Link 4's frame (which has orientation `R_target`).
    `P_wc = P_target - R_target * [0, TCP_offset_y, 0]^T`
    `pwx = px - r12 * TCP_offset_y`
    `pwy = py - r22 * TCP_offset_y`
    `pwz = pz - r32 * TCP_offset_y`

3.  **Solve for Joint 1 (q1):**
    The overall rotation of the arm can be expressed as `R_target = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2) * Ry(q3) * Ry(q4) = Rz(q1) * Ry(q_sum)`, where `q_sum = q2 + q3 + q4`.
    Comparing `R_target` to the structure `Rz(q1)Ry(q_sum)`:
    `Rz(q1)Ry(q_sum) = [[c1*cs, -s1, c1*ss], [s1*cs, c1, s1*ss], [-ss, 0, cs]]`
    (where c1=cos(q1), s1=sin(q1), cs=cos(q_sum), ss=sin(q_sum))
    From the second column, `r12 = -s1` and `r22 = c1`.
    Thus, `q1 = atan2(-r12, r22)`.
    This implies `r32` from the RPY calculation must be 0 for the target to be reachable by this orientation structure. The problem assumes reachability.

4.  **Solve for q_sum = q2 + q3 + q4:**
    From the third row and first/third columns of `Rz(q1)Ry(q_sum)`: `r31 = -ss` and `r33 = cs`.
    Thus, `q_sum = atan2(-r31, r33)`.

5.  **Solve for Joints 2 (q2) and 3 (q3):**
    Transform `P_wc` into Frame 1 (the frame after q1 rotation, with origin at base):
    `P_wc_in_F1_origin = Rz(-q1) * P_wc`
    `x_F1o = c1*pwx + s1*pwy`
    `y_F1o = -s1*pwx + c1*pwy`
    `z_F1o = pwz`
    The origin of Joint 2 in Frame 1 is `O_j2_in_F1 = [0, L0y, 0]^T`.
    The vector from `O_j2_in_F1` to `P_wc_in_F1_origin` (let's call its components `vx, vy, vz` in Frame 1) is:
    `vx = x_F1o`
    `vy = y_F1o - L0y`
    `vz = z_F1o`
    This vector `[vx, vy, vz]^T` is formed by the chain from Joint 2 onwards:
    `[vx, vy, vz]^T = Ry(q2) * ( [0, l2y, l2z]^T + Ry(q3) * [0, 0, l3z]^T )`
    Expanding this:
    `[vx, vy, vz]^T = Ry(q2) * [l3z*s3, l2y, l2z + l3z*c3]^T`
    `vx = c2*(l3z*s3) + s2*(l2z + l3z*c3)`
    `vy = l2y`
    `vz = -s2*(l3z*s3) + c2*(l2z + l3z*c3)`
    From `vy = l2y`, we have a consistency check: `y_F1o - L0y = l2y`.
    For q3: `vx^2 + vz^2 = (l3z*s3)^2 + (l2z + l3z*c3)^2 = l2z^2 + l3z^2 + 2*l2z*l3z*c3`.
    `cos(q3) = (vx^2 + vz^2 - l2z^2 - l3z^2) / (2 * l2z * l3z)`
    `q3 = acos(cos(q3))`. We choose the solution with `q3` in `[0, pi]`, so `sin(q3) >= 0`.
    For q2: Let `X_arm = l3z*sin(q3)` and `Z_arm = l2z + l3z*cos(q3)`.
    `vx = c2*X_arm + s2*Z_arm`
    `vz = -s2*X_arm + c2*Z_arm`
    Solving for `c2` and `s2`:
    `c2 = (vx*X_arm + vz*Z_arm) / (X_arm^2 + Z_arm^2)`
    `s2 = (vx*Z_arm - vz*X_arm) / (X_arm^2 + Z_arm^2)`
    (Denominator `X_arm^2 + Z_arm^2 = vx^2 + vz^2`, which should be non-zero if reachable and not at a singularity specific to `l2z=l3z`).
    `q2 = atan2(s2, c2)`.

6.  **Solve for Joint 4 (q4):**
    `q4 = q_sum - q2 - q3`.

The joint angles are returned as a tuple `(q1, q2, q3, q4)`.
