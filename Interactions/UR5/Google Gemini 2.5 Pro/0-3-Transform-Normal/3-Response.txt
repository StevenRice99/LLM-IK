To address the feedback and improve the inverse kinematics solution, I've identified that the primary issue likely lies in selecting between the two possible solutions for `q3` (often referred to as elbow-up/elbow-down configurations). My previous solution always chose `q3 >= 0` (since `math.acos` returns values in `[0, pi]`). The "correct" solutions provided in the feedback sometimes use a positive `q3` and sometimes a negative `q3`.

The strategy will now be to calculate both potential solutions arising from `q3_positive = acos(val)` and `q3_negative = -acos(val)`. For each of these `q3` values, we will determine the corresponding `q2` and then `q4`. We will then select the set of joint angles `(q1, q2, q3, q4)` that results in `q4` being "more optimal," which we'll define as `q4` having a smaller absolute value after being normalized to the range `[-pi, pi]`. This approach is deterministic and common in IK solvers to choose a preferred configuration when multiple exist.

The core calculations for `q1`, `q_sum` (where `q_sum = q2 + q3 + q4`), and the components `vx_planar` and `vz_planar` (which are inputs to the `q2`/`q3` calculation) remain the same as in my previous reasoning.

The refined algorithm steps:
1.  Calculate the target rotation matrix `R_target` from the input roll, pitch, yaw.
2.  Calculate the wrist center position `P_wc = (pwx, pwy, pwz)` by subtracting the TCP offset from the target position `p`, using `R_target`.
3.  Solve for `q1 = atan2(-r12, r22)` from `R_target`.
4.  Solve for `q_sum_angles = q2 + q3 + q4 = atan2(-r31, r33)` from `R_target`.
5.  Transform `P_wc` into a 2D planning frame for joints `q2, q3`:
    *   `vx_planar = cos(q1)*pwx + sin(q1)*pwy`
    *   `vz_planar = pwz`
    *   (A consistency check: `-sin(q1)*pwx + cos(q1)*pwy - L0y` should be equal to `l2y`. This was verified to hold.)
6.  Calculate `cos_q3 = (vx_planar^2 + vz_planar^2 - l2z^2 - l3z^2) / (2 * l2z * l3z)`. Clamp `cos_q3` to `[-1, 1]` to handle potential floating-point inaccuracies.
7.  **Solution Branch A**:
    *   `q3_A = acos(cos_q3)`
    *   Calculate `sin_q3_A = sin(q3_A)`.
    *   `X_arm_A = l3z * sin_q3_A`
    *   `Z_arm_A = l2z + l3z * cos_q3`
    *   `denominator_A = vx_planar^2 + vz_planar^2` (This is also `X_arm_A^2 + Z_arm_A^2` if no errors)
    *   If `denominator_A` is near zero (singular configuration, though problem assumes reachability and non-singularity for unique solution), handle appropriately (e.g. default `q2`). For now, assume it's not zero.
    *   `cos_q2_A = (vx_planar * X_arm_A + vz_planar * Z_arm_A) / denominator_A`
    *   `sin_q2_A = (vx_planar * Z_arm_A - vz_planar * X_arm_A) / denominator_A`
    *   `q2_A = atan2(sin_q2_A, cos_q2_A)`
    *   `q4_A = q_sum_angles - q2_A - q3_A`
8.  **Solution Branch B**:
    *   `q3_B = -acos(cos_q3)`
    *   Calculate `sin_q3_B = sin(q3_B)`.
    *   `X_arm_B = l3z * sin_q3_B`
    *   `Z_arm_B = l2z + l3z * cos_q3` (Note: `cos_q3` is same for A and B)
    *   `denominator_B = vx_planar^2 + vz_planar^2` (Same as A)
    *   `cos_q2_B = (vx_planar * X_arm_B + vz_planar * Z_arm_B) / denominator_B`
    *   `sin_q2_B = (vx_planar * Z_arm_B - vz_planar * X_arm_B) / denominator_B`
    *   `q2_B = atan2(sin_q2_B, cos_q2_B)`
    *   `q4_B = q_sum_angles - q2_B - q3_B`
9.  **Selection**:
    *   Normalize `q4_A_norm = atan2(sin(q4_A), cos(q4_A))`
    *   Normalize `q4_B_norm = atan2(sin(q4_B), cos(q4_B))`
    *   If `abs(q4_A_norm) <= abs(q4_B_norm)` (with a small tolerance for equality, or by default if equal), choose solution A: `(q1, q2_A, q3_A, q4_A)`.
    *   Else, choose solution B: `(q1, q2_B, q3_B, q4_B)`.
    *   A special case: if `sin(acos(cos_q3))` is zero (i.e., `q3` is 0 or `pi`), then `q3_A` and `q3_B` might lead to the same `sin(q3)` (if `q3=0, q3_A=0, q3_B=0`) or opposite `sin(q3)` but `X_arm` is zero. If `X_arm` is zero, `q2` calculation simplifies. If `q3_A` and `q3_B` effectively yield the same solution (e.g. `q3=0`), then either branch is fine. The selection logic should still work.

This refined approach should allow the solution to match the behavior of the "working solver" more closely by considering both primary geometric solutions for the arm's configuration.
