Okay, I will complete the `inverse_kinematics` method to solve for the position and orientation of the TCP.

The approach involves these main steps:
1.  Calculate the target orientation matrix (`R_target`) from the input RPY angles (`rx, ry, rz`). I'll assume the RPY order is ZYX (Yaw, Pitch, Roll), so `R_target = Rz(rz) * Ry(ry) * Rx(rx)`.
2.  Determine the position of the wrist center (`P_wrist`). This is the origin of the frame where the last joint (Joint 4) rotates. It's found by subtracting the TCP offset from the target TCP position, transformed into the base frame using `R_target`. The TCP offset is `[0, 0.093, 0]` in the frame of Link 4.
3.  Solve for `q1` (Joint 1 angle) using the orientation. The overall rotation can be expressed as `R_target = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2 + q3 + q4)`. From this, `q1` can be extracted from elements of `R_target`.
4.  Transform `P_wrist` into a 2D coordinate system aligned with `q1`. Let these coordinates be `(P_prime_x, P_prime_y, P_prime_z)`. The derivation shows that `P_prime_y` should be equal to `d1y + d2y` (a constant based on link offsets), which serves as a consistency check (though we assume reachability).
5.  Solve for `q3` (Joint 3 angle) using a 2R planar arm analogy. The effective "links" of this 2R arm are `d2z` (0.425m) and `d3z` (0.39225m), operating in the plane defined by `P_prime_x` and `P_prime_z`. `q3` is the "elbow" angle of this 2R arm.
6.  Solve for `q2` (Joint 2 angle), which is the "shoulder" angle of the same 2R planar arm.
7.  Solve for `q4` (Joint 4 angle). We know `q1`, `q2`, `q3`, and the sum `theta_sum = q2 + q3 + q4` (also derivable from `R_target`). Thus, `q4 = theta_sum - q2 - q3`.
8.  The joint angles `q1, q2, q4` will be normalized to the range `[-pi, pi]`. `q3` obtained from `arccos` will be in `[0, pi]`.

The link parameters used are:
*   `d1y = 0.13585m` (offset from J1 to J2 origin along J1's Y-axis, effectively)
*   `d2y = -0.1197m` (offset from J2 to J3 origin along J2's Y-axis)
*   `d2z = 0.425m` (offset from J2 to J3 origin along J2's Z-axis)
*   `d3z = 0.39225m` (offset from J3 to J4 origin along J3's Z-axis)
*   `d4y_tcp = 0.093m` (TCP offset from J4 origin along J4's Y-axis)

Here is the completed Python function:
