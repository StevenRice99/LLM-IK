Okay, I will refine the inverse kinematics method. The core idea is to identify two primary solution families based on the two possible values for `q3` (elbow up/down), and then for each family, adjust `q3` and `q4` by multiples of `2*pi` to ensure all joint angles are within the specified `[-2pi, 2pi]` limits. From all valid adjusted solutions, I will select the one that minimizes the sum of the absolute values of the joint angles. This provides a deterministic way to choose a single solution.

Here's the detailed plan:
1.  Calculate `q1` (Joint 1 angle) and `q_sum = q2 + q3 + q4` from the target orientation matrix `R_target`. `q1` and `q_sum` will be in `[-pi, pi]`.
2.  Determine the wrist center position `P_wrist = (xw, yw, zw)`.
3.  Transform `P_wrist` into Frame 1 (after `q1` rotation) to get `P_1 = (P_1x, P_1y, P_1z)`. The coordinates `(P_1x, P_1z)` are the target for the 2R planar arm.
4.  Calculate `cos_q3_val = (P_1x^2 + P_1z^2 - d2z^2 - d3z^2) / (2 * d2z * d3z)`. Clip this value to `[-1, 1]`.
5.  Define two base values for `q3`:
    *   `q3_base_A = np.arccos(cos_q3_val)` (in `[0, pi]`)
    *   `q3_base_B = -np.arccos(cos_q3_val)` (in `[-pi, 0]`)
6.  For each base `q3` (`q3_s` being `q3_base_A` or `q3_base_B`):
    a.  Calculate `q2_s = np.arctan2(P_1x, P_1z) - np.arctan2(d3z*sin(q3_s), d2z + d3z*cos(q3_s))`. This `q2_s` will be in `[-2pi, 2pi]`.
    b.  Calculate `q4_s_raw = q_sum - q2_s - q3_s`. This `q4_s_raw` can be outside `[-2pi, 2pi]`.
    c.  Iterate `k` through `{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}`. For each `k`:
        i.  Form a candidate solution:
            *   `q1_cand = q1`
            *   `q2_cand = q2_s`
            *   `q3_cand = q3_s + 2*np.pi*k`
            *   `q4_cand = q4_s_raw - 2*np.pi*k`
        ii. Check if all four joint angles (`q1_cand, q2_cand, q3_cand, q4_cand`) are within the limits `[-2*pi, 2*pi]`.
        iii. If the candidate solution is valid, calculate `sum_abs = abs(q1_cand) + abs(q2_cand) + abs(q3_cand) + abs(q4_cand)`.
        iv. Keep track of the `best_solution` found so far that minimizes `sum_abs`. If a new solution has a smaller `sum_abs`, it becomes the `best_solution`. If `sum_abs` is equal, the existing `best_solution` is kept to ensure determinism (e.g., preferring Family A or smaller `k` if they result in the same `sum_abs` and are encountered first).
7.  Return the `best_solution`. If no valid solution is found (which shouldn't happen if the target is reachable as per problem statement), this would indicate an issue.

This approach explores a small, bounded set of potential solutions derived from the two primary elbow configurations and their `2*pi` equivalencies, then selects the "most compact" one based on the sum of absolute joint movements.
