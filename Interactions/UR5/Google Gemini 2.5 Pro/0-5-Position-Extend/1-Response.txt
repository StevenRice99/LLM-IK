To solve the inverse kinematics for the 6-DOF robot to reach a target TCP position `p_tcp = (px, py, pz)`, we will leverage the provided `EXISTING` 5-DOF inverse kinematics solver. The 6-DOF robot has the joint structure Z-Y-Y-Y-Z-Y.

Let's denote the joint angles as `(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5, θ6)`.

**Assumptions and Simplifications:**
1.  **Joint 5 (θ5):** The `EXISTING` code for the 5-DOF arm (Z-Y-Y-Y-Z) calculates `(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4)` and returns `θ5 = 0.0`. The offset from Link 5's origin to Link 6's origin is `[0, 0, 0.09465]` (along Link 5's Z-axis). A rotation `θ5` around Link 5's Z-axis does not change the position of Link 6's origin. Thus, `θ5` is redundant for positioning Link 6's origin. We will accept `θ5 = 0.0` as determined by the existing solver.
2.  **Joint 6 (θ6):** The TCP is located at `[0, 0.0823, 0]` relative to Link 6's frame. Link 6 rotates around its Y-axis by `θ6`. The vector `[0, 0.0823, 0]^T` is along this axis of rotation. Therefore, `RotY(θ6) * [0, 0.0823, 0]^T = [0, 0.0823, 0]^T`. This means `θ6` does not affect the TCP position if the preceding joints `θ1` through `θ5` are set. Thus, `θ6` is redundant for achieving the TCP position. We can choose a fixed value for `θ6`, for instance, `θ6 = 0.0`.

**Strategy:**
The `EXISTING` solver, let's call it `existing_ik(p_j6_target)`, computes `(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5=0.0)` such that the origin of Link 6 (`P_J6`) is positioned at `p_j6_target`.
Our goal is to find the joint angles `(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5, θ6)` such that the TCP is at the user-specified position `P_user_target`.
With `θ5=0` and `θ6=0`:
The position of the TCP (`P_tcp`) is related to the position of Link 6's origin (`P_J6`) by:
`P_tcp = P_J6 + R_W_L5F * V_L6_TCP_in_L5F`
where:
*   `R_W_L5F` is the rotation matrix from Link 5's frame to the world frame. Since `θ5=0`, Link 5's frame orientation is determined by `θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4`. Specifically, `R_W_L5F = R_Z(θ1) * R_Y(θ2) * R_Y(θ3) * R_Y(θ4)`. (The translational offsets between J1-J2, J2-J3, J3-J4 origins are implicitly handled by how these rotations compose).
*   `V_L6_TCP_in_L5F` is the vector from Link 6's origin to the TCP, expressed in Link 5's frame. Since `θ6=0`, Link 6's frame has the same orientation as Link 5's frame. The TCP offset in Link 6's frame is `[0, 0.0823, 0]^T`. So, `V_L6_TCP_in_L5F = [0, 0.0823, 0]^T`.

Thus, the target position for Link 6's origin (`P_J6_target`) should be:
`P_J6_target = P_user_target - R_W_L5F(θ1,θ2,θ3,θ4) * [0, 0.0823, 0]^T`

This equation is implicit: `P_J6_target` depends on `θ1-θ4`, which are the results of calling `existing_ik(P_J6_target)`.
To obtain a closed-form analytical solution, we can use a two-pass approach:

**Two-Pass Approach:**
1.  **Pass 1 (Estimate Angles):**
    *   Make an initial guess for `P_J6_target`. A simple guess is `P_J6_approx = P_user_target`.
    *   Call `(θ1_a, θ2_a, θ3_a, θ4_a, θ5_a) = existing_ik(P_J6_approx)`. Note `θ5_a` will be `0.0`.
2.  **Pass 2 (Correct Target and Final Angles):**
    *   Construct the rotation matrix `R_W_L5F_approx` using the estimated angles `θ1_a, θ2_a, θ3_a, θ4_a`.
        `R_W_L5F_approx = R_Z(θ1_a) * R_Y(θ2_a) * R_Y(θ3_a) * R_Y(θ4_a)`.
    *   Calculate the corrected target for Link 6's origin:
        `P_J6_corrected = P_user_target - R_W_L5F_approx * [0, 0.0823, 0]^T`.
    *   Call `existing_ik` with this corrected target:
        `(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5) = existing_ik(P_J6_corrected)`. Again, `θ5` will be `0.0`.
3.  **Result:** The final joint angles are `(θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5, θ6=0.0)`.

This approach involves a fixed number of steps and uses the provided solver, fitting the description of an analytical solution. Helper functions for rotation matrices and vector operations will be needed.
