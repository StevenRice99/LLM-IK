To find a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the given 6-DOF serial manipulator, we will make a simplifying assumption. Since the problem only asks to solve for the *position* of the TCP and does not specify the orientation, we can choose the orientation of the end-effector by setting the last three joint angles (q4, q5, q6) to zero. This reduces the problem to finding q1, q2, and q3 for a 3-DOF arm to position an effective end-point.

The robot's structure is as follows, with link parameters:
*   `d1 = 0.13585`: Translation along Y from J1 to J2 (in J1's frame after q1 rotation, but effectively an offset for J2's base).
*   `a2 = -0.1197`: Translation along Y from J2 to J3 (in J2's frame after q2 rotation).
*   `d2_const = 0.425`: Translation along Z from J2 to J3 (in J2's frame after q2 rotation).
*   `d3_const = 0.39225`: Translation along Z from J3 to J4 (in J3's frame after q3 rotation).
*   `a4_const = 0.093`: Translation along Y from J4 to J5 (in J4's frame after q4 rotation).
*   `d5_const = 0.09465`: Translation along Z from J5 to J6 (in J5's frame after q5 rotation).
*   `d6_const = 0.0823`: Translation along Y from J6 to TCP (in J6's frame after q6 rotation).

The TCP also has a fixed orientation offset `Rz(pi/2)` relative to the J6 frame, but this does not affect its origin's position if we are calculating the position of the TCP origin.

**Step 1: Define effective TCP offset with q4=q5=q6=0**
If q4=0, q5=0, q6=0, the transformation from J3's frame to the TCP's origin is:
`T_J3_TCP = Trans(0,0,d3_const) * Trans(0,a4_const,0) * Trans(0,0,d5_const) * Trans(0,d6_const,0)`
This simplifies to `Trans(0, a4_const + d6_const, d3_const + d5_const)`.
So, the vector from J3's origin to the TCP's origin, expressed in J3's frame (after q3 rotation), is `P_J3_TCP_in_J3 = [0, y_j3_offset, z_j3_offset, 1]^T`, where:
*   `y_j3_offset = a4_const + d6_const = 0.093 + 0.0823 = 0.1753`
*   `z_j3_offset = d3_const + d5_const = 0.39225 + 0.09465 = 0.4869`

**Step 2: Kinematic equations for q1, q2, q3**
Let the target TCP position be `(px, py, pz)`.
The forward kinematics equations are:
`P_target = RotZ(q1) * Trans(0,d1,0) * RotY(q2) * Trans(0,a2,d2_const) * RotY(q3) * P_J3_TCP_in_J3`

Let `P_after_q3 = RotY(q3) * [0, y_j3_offset, z_j3_offset, 1]^T = [z_j3_offset*s3, y_j3_offset, z_j3_offset*c3, 1]^T`.
Let `P_in_J2_before_rot = Trans(0,a2,d2_const) * P_after_q3 = [z_j3_offset*s3, y_j3_offset+a2, z_j3_offset*c3+d2_const, 1]^T`.
Let `x_prime = z_j3_offset*s3`
Let `y_prime = y_j3_offset+a2`
Let `z_prime = z_j3_offset*c3+d2_const`

Let `P_after_q2 = RotY(q2) * [x_prime, y_prime, z_prime, 1]^T = [x_prime*c2+z_prime*s2, y_prime, -x_prime*s2+z_prime*c2, 1]^T`.
Let `P_in_J1_before_rot = Trans(0,d1,0) * P_after_q2 = [x_prime*c2+z_prime*s2, y_prime+d1, -x_prime*s2+z_prime*c2, 1]^T`.
Let `X1 = x_prime*c2+z_prime*s2`
Let `Y1 = y_prime+d1 = y_j3_offset+a2+d1`
Let `Z1 = -x_prime*s2+z_prime*c2`

Finally, `P_target = RotZ(q1) * [X1, Y1, Z1, 1]^T`:
`px = X1*c1 - Y1*s1`
`py = X1*s1 + Y1*c1`
`pz = Z1`

**Step 3: Solve for q1**
`Y1 = y_j3_offset + a2 + d1 = 0.1753 - 0.1197 + 0.13585 = 0.19145`. This is a constant.
From the equations for `px, py`:
`Y1 = -px*s1 + py*c1`.
Let `R_xy = sqrt(px^2 + py^2)`.
`sin(atan2(py,px) - q1) = Y1 / R_xy`.
`atan2(py,px) - q1 = asin(Y1 / R_xy)`. (Choosing one solution for `asin`)
`q1 = atan2(py,px) - asin(Y1 / R_xy)`.
The term `Y1 / R_xy` must be in `[-1, 1]`. The problem guarantees reachability.

**Step 4: Solve for X1 and Z1**
Once `q1` is known:
`c1 = cos(q1)`, `s1 = sin(q1)`
`X1 = px*c1 + py*s1`
`Z1 = pz`

**Step 5: Solve for q3**
We have:
`X1 = (z_j3_offset*s3)*c2 + (z_j3_offset*c3+d2_const)*s2`
`Z1 = -(z_j3_offset*s3)*s2 + (z_j3_offset*c3+d2_const)*c2`
Squaring and adding these gives:
`X1^2 + Z1^2 = (z_j3_offset*s3)^2 + (z_j3_offset*c3+d2_const)^2`
`X1^2 + Z1^2 = z_j3_offset^2*s3^2 + z_j3_offset^2*c3^2 + 2*z_j3_offset*d2_const*c3 + d2_const^2`
`X1^2 + Z1^2 = z_j3_offset^2 + d2_const^2 + 2*z_j3_offset*d2_const*c3`
`cos(q3) = (X1^2 + Z1^2 - z_j3_offset^2 - d2_const^2) / (2*z_j3_offset*d2_const)`
Let `vz_param = z_j3_offset = 0.4869`.
Let `d2_param = d2_const = 0.425`.
`cos_q3 = (X1^2 + Z1^2 - vz_param^2 - d2_param^2) / (2*vz_param*d2_param)`.
`q3 = acos(cos_q3)`. (Choosing `q3` in `[0, pi]`)

**Step 6: Solve for q2**
Let `A_param = vz_param*sin(q3)`
Let `B_param = vz_param*cos(q3) + d2_param`
Then:
`X1 = A_param*c2 + B_param*s2`
`Z1 = -A_param*s2 + B_param*c2`
This system can be solved for `s2, c2`:
`s2 = (B_param*X1 - A_param*Z1) / (A_param^2+B_param^2)`
`c2 = (A_param*X1 + B_param*Z1) / (A_param^2+B_param^2)`
`q2 = atan2(s2, c2) = atan2(B_param*X1 - A_param*Z1, A_param*X1 + B_param*Z1)`.
The denominator `A_param^2+B_param^2 = X1^2+Z1^2`, which is positive (unless `X1=Z1=0`, which implies a singularity handled by `atan2(0,0)` often returning 0).

**Step 7: Assign q4, q5, q6**
`q4 = 0.0`
`q5 = 0.0`
`q6 = 0.0`

This provides one analytical solution for `(q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6)`.
