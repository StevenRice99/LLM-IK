The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still incorrect and fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions and orientations. The discrepancies between the expected and actual results suggest that the inverse kinematics equations are not properly accounting for the full kinematic chain and the orientation of the TCP.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics of the manipulator must be fully analyzed to derive the correct inverse kinematics equations.
2. The orientation of the TCP is critical and must be incorporated into the calculations.
3. The feedback provides correct joint values for various test cases, which can be used to validate the solution.

### Plan to Fix the Implementation:
1. **Analyze the Forward Kinematics:**
   - Derive the equations for the position and orientation of the TCP in terms of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
   - Use these equations to formulate the inverse kinematics problem.

2. **Incorporate Orientation:**
   - Solve for the joint angles that achieve both the desired position and orientation of the TCP.

3. **Validate the Solution:**
   - Use the correct joint values provided in the feedback to validate the updated implementation.

### Next Steps:
To proceed, I will analyze the forward kinematics of the manipulator to derive the equations relating the joint angles to the TCP position and orientation. This will help in formulating the inverse kinematics equations. Let me know if you would like me to proceed with this analysis.
