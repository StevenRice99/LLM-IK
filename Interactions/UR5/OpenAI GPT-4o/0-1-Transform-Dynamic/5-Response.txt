To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [0, 0, 0] \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Analyze the manipulator structure
- Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
- Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed position of \( [0, -0.1197, 0.425] \) in the local frame of Revolute 2.

### Step 2: Use the provided forward kinematics
The forward kinematics equations describe the position of the TCP as a function of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). Using these equations, we can derive the inverse kinematics.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the projection of the target position onto the X-Y plane. This is solved using the provided Existing Code 1:
\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(-x, y)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is determined by the projection of the target position onto the Y-Z plane. This is solved using the provided Existing Code 2:
\[
\theta_2 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
\]

### Step 5: Implement the solution
We combine the solutions for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) into the final function. Here's the implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    theta_2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
