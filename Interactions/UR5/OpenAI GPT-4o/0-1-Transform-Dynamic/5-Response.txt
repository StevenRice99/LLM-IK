To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \)):**
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis. The angle \( \theta_1 \) can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XY-plane and using the arctangent function to compute the angle.

2. **Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \)):**
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis. After accounting for the contribution of Revolute 1, the remaining position can be used to compute \( \theta_2 \) based on the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Combine Results:**
   - Use the derived equations to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) and return them as the solution.

Now, I will implement the solution in the provided Python function.

### Implementation:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta_1 (Revolute 1)
    theta_1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta_2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by Revolute 2's position
    y_adjusted = y - 0.13585  # Subtract the y-offset of Revolute 2
    z_adjusted = z           # No z-offset for Revolute 2
    
    # Compute theta_2 using the arctangent function
    theta_2 = -math.atan2(-y_adjusted, z_adjusted)
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \). Note that the orientation \( r \) is not used in this case, as the manipulator's degrees of freedom only allow for positioning in space.
