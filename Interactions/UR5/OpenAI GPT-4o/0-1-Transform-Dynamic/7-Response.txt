The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect and fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions and orientations. The provided correct joint values and the corresponding positions and orientations reached by the current implementation highlight significant discrepancies.

### Observations:
1. The current implementation does not account for the full kinematic chain and the transformations between the links.
2. The orientation of the TCP is not considered in the calculations, which is critical for solving the inverse kinematics problem.
3. The feedback provides correct joint values for various test cases, which can be used to refine the solution.

### Plan to Fix the Implementation:
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Chain:**
   - Use the forward kinematics equations to derive the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP position and orientation.
   - Incorporate the transformations between the links to account for the full kinematic chain.

2. **Incorporate Orientation:**
   - The orientation of the TCP must be considered in the calculations. This requires solving for the joint angles that achieve both the desired position and orientation.

3. **Use the Feedback:**
   - Analyze the correct joint values provided in the feedback to understand the relationship between the target positions/orientations and the joint angles.

4. **Refactor the Code:**
   - Update the inverse kinematics function to compute the joint angles based on the full kinematic chain and the desired position and orientation.

### Next Steps:
To proceed, I will analyze the forward kinematics of the manipulator to derive the equations relating the joint angles to the TCP position and orientation. This will help in formulating the inverse kinematics equations. Let me know if you would like me to proceed with this analysis.
