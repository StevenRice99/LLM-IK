The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the current inverse kinematics solution is incorrect. The issue lies in the incorrect computation of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). To address this, I will revise the inverse kinematics function by considering the geometry of the manipulator and the provided forward kinematics results.

### Observations:
1. The TCP position is influenced by both joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
2. The orientation of the TCP is also affected by the joint angles, and this must be accounted for in the solution.
3. The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values show how the TCP position and orientation are achieved.

### Revised Plan:
1. Use the geometry of the manipulator to compute the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position \( p \) and orientation \( r \).
2. Incorporate the offsets and rotations introduced by each joint to accurately compute the joint angles.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues. Here's the updated implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Step 1: Solve for theta_1
    # The first joint rotates about the Z-axis, so we use the projection of the target position onto the X-Y plane.
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta_2
    # The second joint rotates about the Y-axis. We need to account for the offset introduced by the first joint.
    # Adjust the target position to account for the rotation introduced by theta_1.
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta_1) + y * math.sin(theta_1)
    z_prime = z

    # Use the geometry of the manipulator to compute theta_2.
    # The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] in the local frame of Revolute 2.
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)
    l2 = 0.425  # Length of the second link
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of the first link

    # Compute the angle using the law of cosines
    cos_theta_2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta_2 = math.acos(cos_theta_2)

    # Adjust theta_2 based on the orientation of the TCP
    theta_2 = theta_2 - math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)

    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This revised function incorporates the geometry of the manipulator and the offsets introduced by each joint. It uses the law of cosines to compute the second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) and adjusts for the orientation of the TCP. This should resolve the issues identified in the feedback.
