To address the issues in the inverse kinematics function, I will now refine the solution by incorporating the full kinematic chain and considering both the position and orientation of the TCP. Here's the corrected implementation:

### Updated Implementation:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta_1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis
    theta_1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta_2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by Revolute 2's position
    y_adjusted = y - 0.13585  # Subtract the y-offset of Revolute 2
    z_adjusted = z           # No z-offset for Revolute 2
    
    # Compute theta_2 using the arctangent function
    theta_2 = math.atan2(z_adjusted, y_adjusted)
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This implementation considers the kinematic chain and computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \). The orientation \( r \) is not explicitly used, as the manipulator's degrees of freedom only allow for positioning in space.
