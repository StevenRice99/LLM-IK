The forward kinematics results for the second test case confirm that the correct joint values (\( \theta_1 = -1.178039690399823 \), \( \theta_2 = 3.135890035730651 \)) produce the desired TCP position and orientation. However, the current inverse kinematics implementation fails to compute these values correctly. 

### Observations:
1. The TCP position and orientation are consistent with the correct joint values.
2. The current implementation does not correctly account for the orientation of the TCP, particularly the pitch angle (\( r_y \)).
3. The transformation between frames and the trigonometric relationships used to compute \( \theta_2 \) need to be revisited.

### Plan for Refinement:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**: Ensure that the transformations between frames are correctly applied, especially the rotation about the Z-axis for \( \theta_1 \) and the rotation about the Y-axis for \( \theta_2 \).
2. **Incorporate Orientation**: Explicitly include the orientation of the TCP in the calculations, particularly the pitch angle (\( r_y \)).
3. **Verify Trigonometric Relationships**: Double-check the trigonometric relationships used to compute \( \theta_2 \), as errors here could lead to incorrect joint values.

I will now refine the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.
