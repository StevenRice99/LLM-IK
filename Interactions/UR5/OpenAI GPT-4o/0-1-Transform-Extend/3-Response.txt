To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = [x, y, z] \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP position is influenced by both joints.

2. **Decompose the Problem**:
   - Use the provided forward kinematics to understand the relationship between joint angles and the TCP position.
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the projection of the target position onto the X-Y plane.
   - Solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the Z-coordinate and the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The TCP position can be expressed as:
     \[
     p_{TCP} = R_z(\theta_1) \cdot T_1 \cdot R_y(\theta_2) \cdot T_2
     \]
     where \( R_z \) and \( R_y \) are rotation matrices, and \( T_1 \), \( T_2 \) are translations.

4. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - Use the projection of the target position onto the X-Y plane:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(-x, y)
     \]

5. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Use the Z-coordinate and the geometry of the manipulator to solve for \( \theta_2 \).

I will now proceed to implement the solution for the inverse kinematics.
Here is the completed Python function for the inverse kinematics of the 2-DOF manipulator:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of the first link
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of the second link

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Compute the effective position of the TCP in the rotated frame of link 1
    x_eff = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Effective distance in the X-Y plane
    z_eff = z - l1                  # Effective height after subtracting link 1 offset

    # Use trigonometry to solve for theta2
    d = math.sqrt(x_eff**2 + z_eff**2)  # Distance to the TCP
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_eff, x_eff) - math.acos(l2 / d)

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined by projecting the target position onto the X-Y plane and using the `atan2` function.

2. **Theta2 Calculation**:
   - The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is calculated using the effective position of the TCP in the rotated frame of the first link.
   - The effective height \( z_{eff} \) is adjusted by subtracting the offset of the first link.
   - The distance \( d \) to the TCP is computed using the Pythagorean theorem.
   - The angle \( \theta_2 \) is then determined using trigonometric relationships.

This function assumes that the target position is reachable and does not handle cases where the target is out of reach. It also assumes that the orientation \( r \) is not used, as the manipulator does not have additional degrees of freedom to control orientation.
