To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = [x, y, z] \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Define the problem
The manipulator has two revolute joints:
1. Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
2. Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is given as:
\[ \text{TCP} = [0, -0.1197, 0.425] \]

The target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) is provided as input to the function.

### Step 2: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint, Revolute 1, rotates about the Z-axis. The rotation of this joint determines the projection of the target position onto the YZ-plane. Using the provided solution for the sub-chain, we can calculate:
\[ \theta_1 = \arctan2(-x, y) \]

### Step 3: Transform the target position into the frame of Revolute 2
After determining \( \theta_1 \), we transform the target position into the local frame of Revolute 2. This involves rotating the target position by \( -\theta_1 \) about the Z-axis.

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis. The position of the TCP relative to Revolute 2 is given as:
\[ \text{TCP}_{\text{local}} = [0, -0.1197, 0.425] \]

Using the geometry of the manipulator, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \) using trigonometry. The length of the link between Revolute 1 and Revolute 2 is \( 0.13585 \), and the TCP offset is \( 0.1197 \) along the Y-axis and \( 0.425 \) along the Z-axis.

### Step 5: Implement the solution
Now, I will implement the solution in Python.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".

    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Step 2: Transform target position into the frame of Revolute 2
    # Rotation about Z-axis by -theta1
    x_prime = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y_prime = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z_prime = z  # Z-coordinate remains unchanged
    
    # Step 3: Solve for theta2
    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2_y = -0.1197  # Offset of TCP along Y-axis
    l2_z = 0.425  # Offset of TCP along Z-axis
    
    # Effective target position in the local frame of Revolute 2
    target_y = y_prime - l2_y
    target_z = z_prime - l2_z
    
    # Solve for theta2 using trigonometry
    theta2 = math.atan2(target_z, target_y) - math.atan2(l2_z, l2_y)
    
    return theta1, theta2
