The forward kinematics results provide valuable insights into the relationship between the joint angles and the resulting position and orientation of the TCP. Based on the feedback and the forward kinematics results, I will refine the inverse kinematics solution.

### Observations:
1. The correct joint values for the failed test case are:
   \[
   \theta_1 = -2.9944946900482132, \quad \theta_2 = -3.179558180518314
   \]
   These values result in the TCP position:
   \[
   \text{TCP} = [-0.01359018848346226, -0.0183399481723652, -0.4246937432762801]
   \]
   and orientation:
   \[
   \text{Orientation} = [3.141592653589793, 0.03796552692852084, 0.1470979635415799]
   \]

2. The forward kinematics confirms that the TCP position and orientation are consistent with the correct joint values.

3. The current inverse kinematics implementation fails to compute the correct joint values, likely due to incorrect handling of the geometry or transformations.

### Plan for Refinement:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**: Ensure that the transformations between frames are correctly applied, especially the rotation about the Z-axis for \( \theta_1 \) and the rotation about the Y-axis for \( \theta_2 \).

2. **Incorporate Orientation**: The current implementation does not account for the orientation of the TCP. I will include the orientation in the calculations.

3. **Verify Trigonometric Relationships**: Double-check the trigonometric relationships used to compute \( \theta_2 \), as errors here could lead to incorrect joint values.

I will now refine the inverse kinematics function.
