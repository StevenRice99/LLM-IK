It seems we are in a loop of repeated responses. Let me proceed with solving the inverse kinematics problem step by step.

---

To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (Revolute 2) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [0, 0, 0] \). Since the orientation of all links is zero, we only need to focus on the position.

### Step 1: Analyze the geometry
1. The manipulator has two revolute joints:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
2. The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Y-axis and Z-axis.

### Step 2: Derive the equations
Using the forward kinematics, the position of the TCP can be expressed as:
\[
x_{TCP} = 0 \quad \text{(no X-axis movement in this configuration)}
\]
\[
y_{TCP} = 0.13585 \cos(\theta_2) - 0.1197 \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
z_{TCP} = 0.13585 \sin(\theta_2) + 0.1197 \cos(\theta_2) + 0.425
\]

Given the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \), we solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
From the \( z \)-coordinate equation:
\[
z - 0.425 = 0.13585 \sin(\theta_2) + 0.1197 \cos(\theta_2)
\]
Let:
\[
a = z - 0.425, \quad b = 0.13585, \quad c = 0.1197
\]
Then:
\[
a = b \sin(\theta_2) + c \cos(\theta_2)
\]
This can be rewritten using the trigonometric identity:
\[
R \sin(\theta_2 + \phi) = a
\]
where:
\[
R = \sqrt{b^2 + c^2}, \quad \phi = \arctan2(c, b)
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{a}{R}\right) - \phi
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
From the \( y \)-coordinate equation:
\[
y = 0.13585 \cos(\theta_2) - 0.1197 \sin(\theta_2)
\]
Substitute \( \theta_2 \) to find \( \theta_1 \).

Let me now implement this in the Python function.

```python
import math

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Constants from the manipulator geometry
    d1 = 0.425  # Base height to Revolute 2

    # Solve for theta_2
    a = z - d1
    b = l2
    c = l3
    R = math.sqrt(b**2 + c**2)
    phi = math.atan2(c, b)
    theta_2 = math.asin(a / R) - phi
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y, x)  # In this case, x is always 0, so theta_1 = 0
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
