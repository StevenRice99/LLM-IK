The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values indicate that the orientation of the TCP is directly influenced by the rotations of both joints. Specifically:

1. **Revolute 1** contributes to the rotation about the Z-axis (yaw).
2. **Revolute 2** contributes to the rotation about the Y-axis (pitch).

The current inverse kinematics solution fails to account for the orientation constraints properly. To fix this, I will:

1. Use the target orientation \( r \) (roll, pitch, yaw) to calculate the required joint angles.
2. Incorporate both position and orientation constraints into the solution.

Here is the revised function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for theta2 using the z-coordinate and link length
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using the x and y coordinates
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Adjust theta1 and theta2 to account for the target orientation
    # Revolute 1 affects yaw, and Revolute 2 affects pitch
    theta1 += yaw  # Adjust for yaw
    theta2 += pitch  # Adjust for pitch

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Orientation Adjustment**:
   - The yaw component of the target orientation \( r \) is added to \( \theta_1 \), as it corresponds to rotation about the Z-axis.
   - The pitch component of the target orientation \( r \) is added to \( \theta_2 \), as it corresponds to rotation about the Y-axis.

2. **Combination of Position and Orientation**:
   - The position solution is combined with the orientation adjustment to ensure the TCP reaches both the desired position and orientation.

This revised function should now correctly compute the joint angles for both position and orientation.
