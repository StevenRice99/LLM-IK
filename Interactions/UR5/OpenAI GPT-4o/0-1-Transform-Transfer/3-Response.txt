To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to consider the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The provided solution for position already calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position. Since the orientation of all links and the TCP is [0, 0, 0], the orientation does not introduce additional constraints or dependencies on the joint angles.

Thus, the solution for the inverse kinematics remains the same as the position-only solution. I will now complete the function to include both position and orientation.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to reach the target position \( p \). Since the orientation \( r \) is [0, 0, 0] for all links and the TCP, it does not affect the joint angles. Therefore, the solution for position-only inverse kinematics is sufficient to solve the problem.
