The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the current inverse kinematics solution does not account for the orientation of the TCP. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the rotations of both joints, and this must be incorporated into the solution.

To address this, I will revise the inverse kinematics function to include the orientation constraints. Specifically, I will:

1. Use the target orientation \( r \) to calculate the required joint angles that achieve the desired orientation.
2. Combine the position and orientation constraints to solve for both joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

Here is the updated function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for theta2 using the z-coordinate and link length
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using the x and y coordinates
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Adjust theta1 and theta2 to account for the target orientation
    # The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both joints
    theta1 += yaw  # Adjust for yaw
    theta2 += pitch  # Adjust for pitch

    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Orientation Adjustment**: The target orientation \( r \) (roll, pitch, yaw) is used to adjust the joint angles. Specifically:
   - \( \text{yaw} \) affects \( \theta_1 \), as it corresponds to rotation about the Z-axis.
   - \( \text{pitch} \) affects \( \theta_2 \), as it corresponds to rotation about the Y-axis.

2. **Combination of Position and Orientation**: The position solution is combined with the orientation adjustment to ensure the TCP reaches both the desired position and orientation.

This updated function should now correctly compute the joint angles for both position and orientation.
