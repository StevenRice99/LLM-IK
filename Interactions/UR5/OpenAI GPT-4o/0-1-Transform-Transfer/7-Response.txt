The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the current inverse kinematics solution does not correctly account for the orientation of the TCP. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the rotations of both joints, and the current implementation only considers the position.

### Observations:
1. The correct joint values for the first test case are \([-2.86576425689912, 3.259694698540184]\), which produce the correct position and orientation.
2. The forward kinematics results for these joint values confirm that the TCP's position and orientation match the target.

### Adjustments Needed:
To solve the inverse kinematics problem correctly, we need to:
1. **Incorporate Orientation**: The orientation of the TCP must be considered in the computation of \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). This requires solving for the rotation matrices or angles that align the TCP with the desired orientation.
2. **Account for Coupled Rotations**: The orientation of the TCP depends on the combined effects of both joints. This coupling must be resolved analytically.

### Plan:
1. Use the desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\) to compute the required rotations for each joint.
2. Combine the position and orientation constraints to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

I will now update the inverse kinematics function to include orientation.
Here is the updated Python function that incorporates both position and orientation into the inverse kinematics solution:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the desired position and orientation
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Compute theta2 using the z-coordinate
    cos_theta2 = z_d / 0.425
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Compute theta1 using the x and y coordinates
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)

    # Adjust theta1 and theta2 to account for the desired orientation
    # The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both theta1 and theta2
    # Use the desired orientation (r_x, r_y, r_z) to refine the joint angles
    theta1 += r_z  # Adjust theta1 based on the desired rotation around the Z-axis
    theta2 += r_y  # Adjust theta2 based on the desired rotation around the Y-axis

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - The position calculation remains the same as in the original implementation, using the \(z\)-coordinate to compute \(\theta_2\) and the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates to compute \(\theta_1\).

2. **Orientation Adjustment**:
   - The desired orientation \(r = [r_x, r_y, r_z]\) is used to adjust the computed joint angles.
   - \(\theta_1\) is adjusted by \(r_z\) to account for the desired rotation around the Z-axis.
   - \(\theta_2\) is adjusted by \(r_y\) to account for the desired rotation around the Y-axis.

3. **Return**:
   - The adjusted joint angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are returned as the solution.

This updated function should now correctly compute the joint angles to achieve both the desired position and orientation of the TCP.
