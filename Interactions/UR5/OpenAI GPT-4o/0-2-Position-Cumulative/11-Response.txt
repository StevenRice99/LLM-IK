The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not producing correct joint values for the given target positions. The discrepancies suggest that there are issues in the calculations for one or more joints, likely due to incorrect assumptions or errors in the geometric relationships used.

### Analysis of the Issues:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - The calculation of `theta1` using `math.atan2(-x, y)` might be incorrect. The sign or the order of `x` and `y` could be reversed, leading to incorrect azimuthal angles.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - The calculation of `theta2` involves the projection of the target position onto the plane of joint 2's rotation. Errors in the geometry or offsets could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - The calculation of `theta3` depends on the distance `r` and the lengths of the links. If the geometry is not correctly modeled, the resulting angle could be incorrect.

4. **Offsets and Frame Transformations:**
   - The offsets between the links (e.g., the position of joint 2 relative to joint 1) might not be correctly accounted for, leading to errors in the target position used for each joint's calculation.

### Plan for Correction:
To address these issues, I will:
1. Revisit the geometric relationships and ensure that the offsets and transformations between frames are correctly applied.
2. Verify the calculations for each joint angle, ensuring that the correct trigonometric relationships are used.
3. Use the provided correct joint values and positions to validate the updated calculations.

### Updated Code:
Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    # Calculate the azimuthal angle in the horizontal plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Adjust the target position to the frame of joint 2
    # Account for the offset of joint 2 along the y-axis
    x2 = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the horizontal plane
    z2 = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the height offset of joint 2

    # Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    r = math.sqrt(x2**2 + z2**2)  # Distance to the TCP in the plane of joint 2 and 3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)

    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    # Calculate the angle to the target position in the plane of joint 2 and 3
    phi = math.atan2(z2, x2)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = phi - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**
   - Changed the calculation of `theta1` to `math.atan2(y, x)` to correctly compute the azimuthal angle in the horizontal plane.

2. **Offsets:**
   - Adjusted the target position for joint 2 by subtracting the height offset (`0.13585`) from the z-coordinate.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**
   - Ensured that `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors.

4. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**
   - Corrected the calculation of `theta2` by using the adjusted target position and the correct trigonometric relationships.

### Next Steps:
1. Test the updated code with the provided target positions and correct joint values.
2. Verify that the calculated joint values produce the correct TCP positions.
3. If further issues arise, analyze the discrepancies and refine the calculations accordingly.
