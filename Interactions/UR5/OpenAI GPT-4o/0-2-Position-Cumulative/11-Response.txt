The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function, which is [-1, 1]. This happens because the law of cosines calculation for `cos_theta2` may have resulted in a value slightly greater than 1 or less than -1 due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect geometry.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] before computing `sin_theta2`. This will prevent the `math.sqrt` function from encountering a domain error.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Adjust target position to account for Joint 1 rotation
    # Project the target position into the plane of Joint 2 and Joint 3
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the XY-plane
    z_prime = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the offset of Joint 2 along the Z-axis

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 (Joint 2) and theta3 (Joint 3)
    # Use the geometry of the manipulator to solve for the angles
    L2 = 0.425  # Length of the second link
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of the third link (TCP offset)

    # Compute the distance to the target in the plane of Joint 2 and Joint 3
    D = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)

    # Law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to the range [-1, 1]
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Positive root (reachable assumption)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (L2**2 + D**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * D)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to the range [-1, 1]
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)  # Positive root (reachable assumption)
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime) - math.atan2(L3 * sin_theta2, L2 + L3 * cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2` and `cos_theta3`**:
   - Added `cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))` to ensure the value is within the valid range for trigonometric functions.
   - Added `cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))` for the same reason.

2. **Explanation of Clamping**:
   - Numerical inaccuracies or slight deviations in the geometry can cause the computed cosine values to fall outside the valid range of [-1, 1]. Clamping ensures that the values are valid for the `math.sqrt` and `math.acos` functions.

This should resolve the `math domain error` and allow the function to compute the joint angles correctly for all valid inputs. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
