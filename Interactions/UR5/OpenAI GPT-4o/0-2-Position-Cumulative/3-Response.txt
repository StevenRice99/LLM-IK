To solve the inverse kinematics for the full chain, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) that position the TCP at the target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Joint 1 (\(\theta_1\))**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. The solution for \(\theta_1\) can be derived from the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane. This was already solved in **Existing Code 1**.

2. **Joint 2 (\(\theta_2\))**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The solution for \(\theta_2\) was derived in **Existing Code 2**, which also considers the geometry of the second link.

3. **Joint 3 (\(\theta_3\))**: This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. To solve for \(\theta_3\), we need to account for the position of the TCP relative to the third link. The third link's contribution to the TCP position is along its local Z-axis.

### Approach for \(\theta_3\):
- Subtract the contribution of the first two links from the target position \(p\) to isolate the position of the TCP relative to the third link.
- Use trigonometric relationships to solve for \(\theta_3\).

Let me now proceed to complete the function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1 using Existing Code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Adjust the target position to the frame of the second joint
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Projection onto the XY-plane
    z_prime = z - 0.13585  # Subtract the height of the second joint

    # Solve for theta2 using Existing Code 2
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)  # Distance to the target in the XZ-plane
    theta2 = math.acos((d - 0.01615) / 0.425)  # Inverse cosine for the second joint

    # Adjust the target position to the frame of the third joint
    z_double_prime = z_prime - 0.425 * math.cos(theta2)  # Subtract the contribution of the second link
    x_double_prime = x_prime - 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)  # Subtract the contribution of the second link

    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_double_prime, x_double_prime)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) to position the TCP at the target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). It uses the provided solutions for the first two joints and extends them to solve for the third joint.
