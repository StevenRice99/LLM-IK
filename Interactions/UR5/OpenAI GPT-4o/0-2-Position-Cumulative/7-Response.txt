It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. I will now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function for the 3-DOF manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**:
   - Use the position of the TCP relative to the base to calculate the angle for joint 3.
   - This involves determining the projection of the TCP position onto the plane of joint 3's rotation.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**:
   - Use the position of the TCP and the geometry of the manipulator to calculate the angle for joint 2.
   - This involves solving for the angles in the triangle formed by the links and the TCP.

3. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:
   - Use the x and y coordinates of the TCP to calculate the angle for joint 1.
   - This involves determining the azimuthal angle in the horizontal plane.

### Implementation:
Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Adjust the target position to the frame of joint 2
    y2 = y - 0.13585  # Offset of joint 2 along the y-axis

    # Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y2**2 + z**2)  # Distance to the TCP
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    phi = math.atan2(z, math.sqrt(x**2 + y2**2))
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = phi - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the given coordinates `p`. It uses trigonometric relationships and the geometry of the manipulator to solve for the angles analytically.
