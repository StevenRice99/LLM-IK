The feedback indicates that the current implementation fails to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions. The primary issue seems to be that the second joint angle (\(\theta_2\)) is always computed as \(0\), which is incorrect. This suggests that the logic for solving \(\theta_2\) is flawed or incomplete. Additionally, the third joint angle (\(\theta_3\)) is also incorrect, as it depends on the incorrect computation of \(\theta_2\).

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Incorrect \(\theta_2\) Calculation:**
   - The current implementation assumes a simplified geometry for \(\theta_2\), which does not account for the full kinematic chain. This results in \(\theta_2\) being computed as \(0\) in all cases.

2. **Incorrect \(\theta_3\) Calculation:**
   - Since \(\theta_3\) depends on the position of the TCP relative to the third link, any error in \(\theta_2\) propagates to \(\theta_3\), leading to incorrect results.

3. **Forward Kinematics Mismatch:**
   - The positions reached by the robot do not match the target positions, indicating that the inverse kinematics calculations do not correctly account for the robot's geometry.

### Plan to Fix
To address these issues, I will:
1. Revisit the kinematic chain and ensure that the calculations for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) are consistent with the robot's geometry.
2. Use the provided forward kinematics data to verify the correctness of the inverse kinematics calculations.
3. Update the logic for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) to correctly account for the contributions of all links.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Transform the target position into the frame of the second joint
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Projection onto the XY-plane
    z_prime = z - 0.13585  # Subtract the height of the second joint

    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis of the second joint)
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)  # Distance to the target in the XZ-plane
    if d > (0.425 + 0.39225):  # Check if the target is out of reach
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach.")
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - 0.425**2 - 0.39225**2) / (2 * 0.425 * 0.39225)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to avoid math domain errors
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta3 (rotation about Y-axis of the third joint)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Compute sin(theta2) using Pythagoras
    z_double_prime = z_prime - 0.425 * cos_theta2  # Subtract the contribution of the second link
    x_double_prime = x_prime - 0.425 * sin_theta2  # Subtract the contribution of the second link
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_double_prime, x_double_prime)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Corrected \(\theta_2\) Calculation:**
   - The updated calculation for \(\theta_2\) uses the law of cosines to compute the angle based on the distances between the links and the target position. This ensures that \(\theta_2\) is computed correctly for all reachable target positions.

2. **Clamping for Numerical Stability:**
   - The value of \(\cos(\theta_2)\) is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid math domain errors in the `math.acos` function.

3. **Updated \(\theta_3\) Calculation:**
   - The calculation for \(\theta_3\) now correctly accounts for the contributions of the second link to the TCP position.

4. **Validation of Reachability:**
   - A check is added to ensure that the target position is within the robot's reachable workspace. If the target is out of reach, an error is raised.
