The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the valid range for the `math.acos` function, which is \([-1, 1]\). This typically happens due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the formula for `cos_theta3`.

### Debugging the Issue
The formula for `cos_theta3` is:
\[
\cos(\theta_3) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
\]
Where:
- \(d\) is the distance in the X-Z plane.
- \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) are the lengths of the second and third links, respectively.

If the value of \(d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2\) is too large or too small, it can push \(\cos(\theta_3)\) outside the valid range. This can happen due to:
1. Numerical inaccuracies in the computation of \(d\).
2. A mismatch between the target position and the manipulator's reach.

### Fixing the Issue
To ensure that `cos_theta3` is always within the valid range, we can clamp its value to \([-1, 1]\) before passing it to `math.acos`. This will handle any numerical inaccuracies gracefully.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of Revolute 2
    y_adjusted = y - 0.13585

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 (rotations about Y-axis)
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)

    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Determine the sign of theta3 based on the cross product
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta3))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3

    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of the Fix
1. **Clamping `cos_theta3`**: The value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
   ```python
   cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
   ```
   This ensures that `math.acos` always receives a valid input, preventing the `ValueError`.

2. **Cross Product Check**: The sign of \(\theta_3\) is determined using the cross product, as before.

### Testing
This updated code should now handle all valid inputs without encountering a math domain error. If the target position is unreachable (which the problem states will not happen), the clamping will still ensure the function behaves gracefully.
