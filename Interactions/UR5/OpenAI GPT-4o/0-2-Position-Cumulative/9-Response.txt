It seems there is a repetitive response loop. Let me proceed with solving the inverse kinematics problem step by step.

To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the plan:

1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. Its angle can be determined using the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane.
2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined using the geometry of the manipulator and the target position.
3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**: This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined using the remaining distance to the target position after accounting for the contributions of joints 1 and 2.

Let me now proceed to implement the solution.
Here is the completed Python function for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF manipulator:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Adjust target position to account for Joint 1 rotation
    # Project the target position into the plane of Joint 2 and Joint 3
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the XY-plane
    z_prime = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the offset of Joint 2 along the Z-axis

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 (Joint 2) and theta3 (Joint 3)
    # Use the geometry of the manipulator to solve for the angles
    L2 = 0.425  # Length of the second link
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of the third link (TCP offset)

    # Compute the distance to the target in the plane of Joint 2 and Joint 3
    D = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)

    # Law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (D**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Positive root (reachable assumption)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (L2**2 + D**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * D)
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)  # Positive root (reachable assumption)
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime) - math.atan2(L3 * sin_theta2, L2 + L3 * cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Theta 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
   - Calculated using the arctangent of the target's projection onto the XY-plane.

2. **Theta 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**:
   - Uses the law of cosines to determine the angle based on the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Theta 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**:
   - Adjusts for the remaining distance to the target after accounting for the contributions of the first two joints.

This function assumes that the target position is reachable and does not include checks for joint limits or singularities. It uses basic trigonometry and the geometry of the manipulator to compute the joint angles.
