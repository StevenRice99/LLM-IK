The error indicates that the code incorrectly determines some valid target positions as "out of reach." This suggests that the reachability check is overly restrictive or incorrectly implemented. Let me carefully analyze and fix this issue.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Reachability Check:**
   - The current reachability check compares the distance \(d\) to the sum of the link lengths (\(0.425 + 0.39225\)). However, this is unnecessary because the problem explicitly states that all target positions are reachable. Therefore, the reachability check should be removed.

2. **Law of Cosines for \(\theta_2\):**
   - The calculation for \(\cos(\theta_2)\) uses the law of cosines. If the target position is valid but the calculation is numerically unstable (e.g., due to floating-point inaccuracies), it might incorrectly determine that the target is unreachable.

3. **Numerical Stability:**
   - The clamping of \(\cos(\theta_2)\) to the range \([-1, 1]\) is already in place, but the reachability check itself is unnecessary.

### Plan to Fix
1. **Remove the Reachability Check:**
   - Since all target positions are guaranteed to be reachable, the check for \(d > (0.425 + 0.39225)\) will be removed.

2. **Ensure Numerical Stability:**
   - Retain the clamping of \(\cos(\theta_2)\) to the range \([-1, 1]\) to handle any numerical inaccuracies.

3. **Verify the Logic for \(\theta_3\):**
   - Ensure that the calculation for \(\theta_3\) correctly accounts for the contributions of the second and third links.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Transform the target position into the frame of the second joint
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Projection onto the XY-plane
    z_prime = z - 0.13585  # Subtract the height of the second joint

    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis of the second joint)
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)  # Distance to the target in the XZ-plane
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - 0.425**2 - 0.39225**2) / (2 * 0.425 * 0.39225)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to avoid math domain errors
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)  # Inverse cosine for the second joint

    # Solve for theta3 (rotation about Y-axis of the third joint)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Compute sin(theta2) using Pythagoras
    z_double_prime = z_prime - 0.425 * cos_theta2  # Subtract the contribution of the second link
    x_double_prime = x_prime - 0.425 * sin_theta2  # Subtract the contribution of the second link
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_double_prime, x_double_prime)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Removed Reachability Check:**
   - The check for \(d > (0.425 + 0.39225)\) was removed because all target positions are guaranteed to be reachable.

2. **Clamping for Numerical Stability:**
   - The clamping of \(\cos(\theta_2)\) ensures that the calculation remains stable even for edge cases.

3. **Verified \(\theta_3\) Calculation:**
   - The calculation for \(\theta_3\) was reviewed and confirmed to correctly account for the contributions of the second and third links.
