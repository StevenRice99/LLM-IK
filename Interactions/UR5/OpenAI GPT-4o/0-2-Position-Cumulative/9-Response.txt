The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function, which is [-1, 1]. This can happen due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the formula for `cos_theta3`. To fix this, we need to ensure that `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] before calculating `sin_theta3`.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Adjust the target position to the frame of joint 2
    y2 = y - 0.13585  # Offset of joint 2 along the y-axis

    # Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y2**2 + z**2)  # Distance to the TCP
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)

    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    phi = math.atan2(z, math.sqrt(x**2 + y2**2))
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = phi - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Fix:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta3`:**
   - The value of `cos_theta3` is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_3) = \frac{r^2 - d_1^2 - d_2^2}{2 d_1 d_2}
     \]
   - Due to numerical inaccuracies or edge cases, `cos_theta3` might slightly exceed the range [-1, 1], causing a `math domain error` when calculating `sin_theta3` using `math.sqrt(1 - \cos^2(\theta_3))`.
   - To prevent this, we clamp `cos_theta3` to the range [-1, 1] using `max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))`.

2. **No Other Changes:**
   - The rest of the code remains the same, as the issue was isolated to the calculation of `sin_theta3`.

This fix ensures that the function works correctly for all valid inputs. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
