The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still failing to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issues seem to be:

1. **Incorrect handling of the kinematic chain**:
   - The geometry of the manipulator is not being modeled correctly, leading to significant errors in the computed joint angles.

2. **Incorrect computation of \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\)**:
   - The current approach does not properly account for the contributions of all joints to the final TCP position.

3. **Over-reliance on simplified assumptions**:
   - The current implementation assumes a simplified geometry that does not fully capture the manipulator's structure.

### Plan to Fix the Issues

To address these problems, I will:
1. **Revisit the kinematic chain**:
   - Carefully analyze the manipulator's structure and ensure that the geometry is correctly modeled.

2. **Use forward kinematics to verify the solution**:
   - After computing the joint angles, use forward kinematics to verify that the resulting TCP position matches the target position.

3. **Iteratively refine the solution**:
   - Adjust the computation of \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) to ensure that the manipulator reaches the target position.

---

### Revised Approach

1. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - The manipulator consists of three revolute joints, with the TCP offset by \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to the last joint.
   - The positions and orientations of the links must be carefully accounted for when computing the joint angles.

2. **Compute \(\theta_1\)**:
   - \(\theta_1\) determines the rotation around the base (z-axis) to align the manipulator with the target in the \(xy\)-plane.

3. **Compute \(\theta_2\)**:
   - \(\theta_2\) determines the angle of the second joint, which positions the manipulator in the \(xz\)-plane.

4. **Compute \(\theta_3\)**:
   - \(\theta_3\) determines the angle of the third joint, which adjusts the TCP position to match the target.

5. **Verify the Solution**:
   - Use forward kinematics to verify that the computed joint angles result in the correct TCP position.

### Updated Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Adjust for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - 0.39225  # Subtract the TCP offset along the z-axis

    # Compute planar distance to the target
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_adjusted**2)  # Distance to the target in 3D space

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.1197   # Length of link 3 (to the TCP)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta3
    phi = math.atan2(z_adjusted, r)  # Angle to the target in the plane
    psi = math.asin((l2 * math.sin(theta2)) / d)  # Angle contribution from link 2
    theta3 = phi - psi

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **TCP Offset Adjustment**:
   - The TCP offset is subtracted from the \(z\)-coordinate to compute the effective position of the last revolute joint.

2. **Planar Distance**:
   - The planar distance \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) is computed to simplify the geometry.
   - The total distance \(d = \sqrt{r^2 + z_{\text{adjusted}}^2}\) is used to solve for the joint angles.

3. **Law of Cosines for \(\theta_2\)**:
   - The law of cosines is used to compute \(\theta_2\), ensuring that the geometry of the manipulator is correctly modeled.

4. **Angle Decomposition for \(\theta_3\)**:
   - The angle \(\phi\) is the angle to the target in the plane, and \(\psi\) is the contribution from link 2. The difference \(\phi - \psi\) gives \(\theta_3\).

5. **Base Rotation for \(\theta_1\)**:
   - The angle \(\theta_1\) is computed as the rotation around the base (z-axis), which aligns the manipulator with the target in the \(xy\)-plane.

### Next Steps

This updated code should now correctly compute the joint angles for the entire kinematic chain. If there are still issues, I will analyze the feedback and refine the solution further.
