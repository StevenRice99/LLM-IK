The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics solution is still failing to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions. The discrepancies between the expected and computed joint values suggest that there are fundamental issues in the implementation. The primary issues seem to be related to:

1. **Incorrect handling of the TCP offset.**
2. **Incorrect transformations into the local frames of the joints.**
3. **Incorrect or incomplete geometry calculations for the manipulator.**

To address these issues, I will take a more systematic approach to solving the inverse kinematics problem.

### Revised Approach

The manipulator has 3 revolute joints, and the task is to compute the joint angles \((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)\) that position the TCP at the target position \((x, y, z)\). Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Account for the TCP Offset:**
   - The TCP is offset by \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to the last joint. This offset must be subtracted from the target position to compute the position of the last joint.

2. **Solve for Joint 1 (\(\theta_1\)):**
   - Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis. Its angle can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XY-plane and calculating the angle between the Y-axis and the projection.

3. **Transform the Target Position into the Local Frame of Joint 2:**
   - After solving for \(\theta_1\), the target position must be transformed into the local frame of Joint 2. This involves accounting for the rotation caused by \(\theta_1\) and the Y-offset of Joint 2.

4. **Solve for Joints 2 and 3 (\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\)):**
   - Use the geometry of the manipulator to compute \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\). This involves solving a planar 2-link arm problem in the YZ-plane.

5. **Verify and Adjust the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the computed joint angles produce the correct TCP position by verifying the forward kinematics.

### Updated Code

Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0, 0.39225] relative to the last joint
    z -= 0.39225

    # Step 2: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Transform the target position into the local frame of Joint 2
    # Joint 2 is offset along the Y-axis by 0.13585
    y_local = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - 0.13585

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 (planar 2-link arm in the YZ-plane)
    # Effective target position in the YZ-plane
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    r = math.sqrt(y_local**2 + z**2)  # Distance to the target in the YZ-plane

    # Solve for theta3 (angle of the second link relative to the first link)
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2 (angle of the first link relative to the base)
    phi = math.atan2(z, y_local)  # Angle to the target position
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)  # Offset due to the second link
    theta2 = phi - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Key Changes

1. **TCP Offset:**
   - The TCP offset \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) is subtracted from the target position to compute the position of the last joint.

2. **Transformation into Local Frame:**
   - The target position is transformed into the local frame of Joint 2 by accounting for the Y-offset of Joint 2.

3. **Clamping \( \cos(\theta_3) \):**
   - The value of \( \cos(\theta_3) \) is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid math domain errors.

4. **Revised \( \theta_1 \):**
   - The calculation of \( \theta_1 \) is updated to ensure consistency with the transformed target position.

### Testing

This updated code should now correctly compute the joint angles for all valid target positions. Let me know if further issues arise!
