To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) (Joint 1)
The first joint rotates about the Z-axis. From the existing code for joint 1, we can calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the target position \( p \):
\[
\theta_1 = -\text{atan2}(x, y)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) (Joints 2 and 3)
The second and third joints rotate about the Y-axis. To solve for these, we need to:
1. Transform the target position \( p \) into the plane of the second and third joints.
2. Use the geometry of the manipulator to calculate the angles.

The TCP position relative to the base frame is:
\[
p_{\text{TCP}} = [0, 0.01615, 0.81725]
\]
The position of the second joint is:
\[
p_{\text{joint2}} = [0, 0.13585, 0]
\]
The position of the third joint is:
\[
p_{\text{joint3}} = [0, 0.01615, 0.425]
\]

Using the geometry of the manipulator, we can calculate \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) using trigonometric relationships.

### Step 3: Write the Code
Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = -math.atan2(x, y)

    # Transform the target position into the plane of joint 2 and joint 3
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the XY plane
    z_offset = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the height of joint 2

    # Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    r = math.sqrt(d**2 + z_offset**2)  # Distance to the target in the plane
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines and cosines
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    alpha = math.atan2(z_offset, d)
    beta = math.atan2(l2 * sin_theta3, l1 + l2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to position the TCP at the target position \( p \).
