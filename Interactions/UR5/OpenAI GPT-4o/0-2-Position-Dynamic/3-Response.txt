To solve the inverse kinematics for the entire chain, I will combine the solutions for the sub-chains provided in the "EXISTING" sections. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 1" to calculate the angle for joint 1. This solution determines the rotation about the Z-axis to align the manipulator with the target position in the XY-plane.

2. **Joints 2 and 3 (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3)**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 2" to calculate the angles for joints 2 and 3. This solution determines the angles required to position the end-effector at the target position in the XZ-plane.

3. **Combine the results**: Return the calculated angles for joints 1, 2, and 3 as a tuple.

Now, I will implement the solution in the provided function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for joint 1 using the solution from EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Transform the target position into the frame of joint 2
    # Joint 2 is offset along the Y-axis by 0.13585
    y2 = y - 0.13585

    # Solve for joints 2 and 3 using the solution from EXISTING 2
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta3 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta3))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```
