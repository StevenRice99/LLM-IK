To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)):**
   - Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis. Its angle can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XY-plane and calculating the angle between the Y-axis and the projection.
   - This is already solved in **Existing Code 1**.

2. **Joint 2 and Joint 3 (\( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)):**
   - These joints control the position of the TCP in the YZ-plane after accounting for the rotation caused by \( \theta_1 \).
   - The effective target position for these joints is calculated by transforming the global target position into the local frame of Joint 2.
   - This is partially solved in **Existing Code 2**, which calculates the angles for a 2-link planar arm.

3. **Combining the solutions:**
   - Use the solutions for \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to complete the inverse kinematics function.

Now, I will implement the complete solution.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Transform the target position into the local frame of Joint 2
    # Joint 2 is offset along the Y-axis by 0.13585
    y_local = y - 0.13585

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 (planar 2-link arm in the YZ-plane)
    # Effective target position in the YZ-plane
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    r = math.sqrt(y_local**2 + z**2)  # Distance to the target in the YZ-plane

    # Solve for theta3 (angle of the second link relative to the first link)
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2 (angle of the first link relative to the base)
    phi = math.atan2(z, y_local)  # Angle to the target position
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)  # Offset due to the second link
    theta2 = phi - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \). It uses trigonometric relationships and the geometry of the manipulator to derive the solution.
