To solve the inverse kinematics for the entire chain, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) that position the TCP at the desired target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Decompose the problem**:
   - Use the provided solutions for sub-chains to solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) (Existing Code 1).
   - Extend the solution to include \(\theta_3\), which accounts for the final link's contribution to the TCP position.

2. **Adjust for the TCP offset**:
   - The TCP is offset by \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to the last revolute joint (Revolute 3). This offset must be subtracted from the target position \(p\) to compute the effective position of the last revolute joint.

3. **Solve for \(\theta_3\)**:
   - Use the geometry of the manipulator to compute \(\theta_3\) based on the remaining position after accounting for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

Let me now extend the solution to include \(\theta_3\).
Here is the completed Python function for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF manipulator:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Adjust for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - 0.39225  # Subtract the TCP offset along the z-axis

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using Existing Code 1
    theta2 = math.acos(z_adjusted / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Solve for theta3
    # The remaining position after accounting for theta1 and theta2
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z_adjusted)  # Use Existing Code 2 logic for the final joint

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
1. **TCP Offset Adjustment**:
   - The TCP is offset by \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to the last revolute joint. This offset is subtracted from the target \(z\)-coordinate to compute the effective position of the last revolute joint.

2. **Using Existing Code 1**:
   - The solution for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) is directly adapted from Existing Code 1. It calculates the angles based on the geometry of the first two links.

3. **Using Existing Code 2**:
   - The solution for \(\theta_3\) is adapted from Existing Code 2. It calculates the angle based on the remaining position after accounting for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).

This function should now correctly compute the joint angles \((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)\) to position the TCP at the desired target \(p = (x, y, z)\).
