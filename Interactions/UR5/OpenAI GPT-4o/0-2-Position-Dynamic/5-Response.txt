To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) (Joint 1)
The first joint rotates about the Z-axis. From the provided **EXISTING 1** code, we can calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the target position \( p \):
\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(-x, y)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \theta_3 \) (Joint 3)
The third joint rotates about the Y-axis. From the provided **EXISTING 2** code, we can calculate \( \theta_3 \) using the position of the TCP relative to the second joint. However, we need to account for the offset introduced by the TCP's position along the Z-axis. The effective position for joint 3 can be derived by subtracting the TCP offset from the target position.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) (Joint 2)
The second joint also rotates about the Y-axis. To calculate \( \theta_2 \), we need to consider the geometry of the manipulator, including the link lengths and offsets. Using trigonometry, we can determine \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position and the positions of the other joints.

### Final Implementation
Here is the Python implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.13585  # Distance from base to joint 2 along Y-axis
    d2 = 0.425    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 along Z-axis
    d3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP along Z-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta3
    # Effective position for joint 3
    z3 = z - d3  # Subtract TCP offset
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in XY plane
    theta3 = math.atan2(r, z3)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2
    # Using the law of cosines
    L = math.sqrt(r**2 + (z3 - d1)**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to target
    cos_theta2 = (d2**2 + L**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * L)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
