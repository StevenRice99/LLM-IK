The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function, which is \([-1, 1]\). This happens because of numerical inaccuracies or invalid geometry calculations. Let's analyze and fix the issue step by step.

---

### Root Cause
The equation for `cos_theta3` is:
\[
\cos(\theta_3) = \frac{r^2 - d_1^2 - d_2^2}{2 d_1 d_2}
\]
If the value of \( r^2 - d_1^2 - d_2^2 \) is too large or too small, it can push \(\cos(\theta_3)\) outside the valid range \([-1, 1]\). This can happen due to:
1. Numerical precision errors.
2. Incorrect calculation of \( r \), the distance to the target in the YZ-plane.

---

### Fix
To ensure that \(\cos(\theta_3)\) stays within the valid range:
1. Clamp \(\cos(\theta_3)\) to the range \([-1, 1]\) before calculating \(\sin(\theta_3)\).
2. Recheck the calculation of \( r \) to ensure it is correct.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Transform the target position into the local frame of Joint 2
    # Joint 2 is offset along the Y-axis by 0.13585
    y_local = y - 0.13585

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 (planar 2-link arm in the YZ-plane)
    # Effective target position in the YZ-plane
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    r = math.sqrt(y_local**2 + z**2)  # Distance to the target in the YZ-plane

    # Solve for theta3 (angle of the second link relative to the first link)
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2 (angle of the first link relative to the base)
    phi = math.atan2(z, y_local)  # Angle to the target position
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)  # Offset due to the second link
    theta2 = phi - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Clamping `cos_theta3`:**
   - The value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
     ```
   - This ensures that the input to `math.sqrt` is always valid.

2. **Rechecking `r`:**
   - The calculation of \( r \) is correct as:
     \[
     r = \sqrt{y_{\text{local}}^2 + z^2}
     \]
   - This represents the distance to the target in the YZ-plane.

---

### Why Clamping Works
Clamping ensures that small numerical errors do not cause invalid inputs to trigonometric functions. For example:
- If \( \cos(\theta_3) = 1.0000001 \) due to floating-point precision, clamping it to \( 1 \) avoids the `math domain error`.

---

### Testing
This updated code should now handle all valid inputs without encountering a `math domain error`. Let me know if further issues arise!
