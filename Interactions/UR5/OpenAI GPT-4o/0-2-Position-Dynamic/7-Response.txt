The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics solution is failing to produce correct joint values for various target positions. The primary issue seems to be that the transformation of the target position into the correct reference frame for each joint is not being handled properly. Additionally, the logic for calculating joint angles may not be consistent with the robot's kinematic structure.

To address these issues, I will carefully analyze the kinematic chain and ensure that:
1. The target position is correctly transformed into the reference frame of each joint.
2. The calculations for joint angles are consistent with the robot's geometry and constraints.

### Observations:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**: The calculation of `theta1` using `atan2(-x, y)` may not be correct because the target position needs to be transformed into the base frame of the robot. The offset along the Y-axis (0.13585) must be considered.
2. **Joints 2 and 3 (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3)**: The calculation of `theta2` and `theta3` assumes that the target position lies in the XZ-plane, but this is not always the case. The Y-axis offset and the orientation of the links must be properly accounted for.

### Plan:
1. **Transform the target position**: Adjust the target position to account for the offsets and orientations of the links.
2. **Recalculate joint angles**:
   - `theta1`: Use the correct transformation to calculate the rotation about the Z-axis.
   - `theta2` and `theta3`: Use the transformed position to calculate the angles for the second and third joints, ensuring that the geometry of the manipulator is respected.

I will now revise the implementation to address these issues.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Link offsets
    d1 = 0.13585  # Offset along Y-axis for joint 2
    L1 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3

    # Step 1: Solve for joint 1 (theta1)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of joint 2
    y_adjusted = y - d1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y_adjusted)

    # Step 2: Transform the target position into the frame of joint 2
    # Rotate the target position by -theta1 around the Z-axis
    x_prime = math.cos(-theta1) * x + math.sin(-theta1) * y_adjusted
    y_prime = -math.sin(-theta1) * x + math.cos(-theta1) * y_adjusted
    z_prime = z  # Z-coordinate remains unchanged

    # Step 3: Solve for joints 2 and 3 (theta2 and theta3)
    # Use the transformed position (x_prime, z_prime) to calculate the angles
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)  # Distance to the target in the XZ-plane

    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Calculate theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_prime, x_prime)  # Angle to the target in the XZ-plane
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))  # Angle of the second link
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Adjusted the target position for joint 1**: Subtracted the Y-axis offset (0.13585) before calculating `theta1`.
2. **Transformed the target position**: Rotated the target position into the frame of joint 2 using `theta1`.
3. **Recalculated `theta2` and `theta3`**: Used the transformed position to calculate the angles for the second and third joints, ensuring that the geometry of the manipulator is respected.

This revised implementation should produce correct joint values for all valid target positions.
