The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics (IK) solver is failing to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions. The discrepancies between the expected and computed joint values suggest that there are fundamental issues in the calculations, particularly in the geometric relationships and transformations used to compute the joint angles.

### Key Observations from the Feedback
1. **Incorrect Joint Values:** The computed joint values are significantly different from the correct joint values, leading to large errors in the TCP position.
2. **Systematic Errors:** The errors are not random but systematic, indicating that the geometric relationships or transformations in the code are incorrect.
3. **Wide Range of Failures:** The failures occur across a wide range of target positions, suggesting that the issue is not limited to specific edge cases but is a fundamental problem in the implementation.

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues likely stem from:
1. **Incorrect Geometric Relationships:** The transformations and trigonometric relationships used to compute the joint angles may not accurately represent the manipulator's kinematics.
2. **Incorrect Frame Transformations:** The target position may not be correctly transformed into the coordinate frame of the joints.
3. **Incorrect Handling of Joint Dependencies:** The dependencies between the joints (e.g., how \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) interact) may not be correctly accounted for.

### Plan for Fixing the Code
To address these issues, we need to:
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Chain:** Carefully derive the forward kinematics equations for the manipulator and use them to compute the inverse kinematics.
2. **Account for Joint Dependencies:** Ensure that the relationships between the joints are correctly modeled.
3. **Validate Intermediate Steps:** Break down the calculations into smaller steps and validate each step to identify where the errors occur.

### Updated Approach
We will:
1. Use the correct forward kinematics equations to derive the inverse kinematics.
2. Ensure that the target position is correctly transformed into the coordinate frame of each joint.
3. Correctly compute the joint angles using the geometric relationships.

Here is the updated implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Transform the target position into the plane of joint 2 and joint 3
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the XY plane
    z_offset = z - 0.13585  # Adjust for the height of joint 2

    # Solve for theta3 using the law of cosines
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    r = math.sqrt(d**2 + z_offset**2)  # Distance to the target in the plane
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)

    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines and cosines
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)
    alpha = math.atan2(z_offset, d)
    beta = math.atan2(l2 * sin_theta3, l1 + l2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Adjust theta1 to match the correct orientation
    theta1 = -theta1

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Key Changes
1. **Corrected \(\theta_1\):** The sign of \(\theta_1\) was adjusted to match the correct orientation.
2. **Validated \(\cos(\theta_3)\):** The value of \(\cos(\theta_3)\) is clamped to the valid range to prevent domain errors.
3. **Revised \(\theta_2\):** The calculation of \(\theta_2\) was revised to ensure that it correctly accounts for the geometry of the manipulator.

### Next Steps
1. Test the updated implementation on the provided test cases.
2. Validate the computed joint values against the correct joint values.
3. If the errors persist, further analyze the forward kinematics and geometric relationships to identify any remaining issues.
