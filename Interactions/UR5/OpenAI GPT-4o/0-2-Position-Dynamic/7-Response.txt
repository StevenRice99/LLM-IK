The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is failing to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions. The primary issues seem to be:

1. **Incorrect handling of the geometry**:
   - The current implementation does not properly account for the full kinematic chain, especially the interaction between the joints and the TCP offset.

2. **Incorrect computation of joint angles**:
   - The values for \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) are not being calculated correctly, leading to significant errors in the resulting TCP position.

3. **Over-reliance on existing code**:
   - While the existing code provides solutions for sub-chains, it does not fully address the complete kinematic chain, and the current implementation does not properly extend these solutions.

### Plan to Fix the Issues
To address these problems, I will:
1. Revisit the kinematic chain and ensure that the geometry is correctly modeled.
2. Use the correct transformations to compute the joint angles for the entire chain.
3. Properly account for the TCP offset and ensure that the calculations are consistent with the manipulator's structure.

Let me revise the function step by step.

### Revised Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Adjust for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - 0.39225  # Subtract the TCP offset along the z-axis

    # Compute the planar distance to the target
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_adjusted**2)  # Distance to the target in 3D space

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.1197   # Length of link 3 (to the TCP)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1
    phi = math.atan2(z_adjusted, r)  # Angle to the target in the plane
    psi = math.asin((l2 * math.sin(theta2)) / d)  # Angle contribution from link 2
    theta1 = phi - psi

    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, x)  # Rotation around the base (z-axis)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **TCP Offset Adjustment**:
   - The TCP offset is subtracted from the \(z\)-coordinate to compute the effective position of the last revolute joint.

2. **Planar Distance**:
   - The planar distance \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\) is computed to simplify the geometry.
   - The total distance \(d = \sqrt{r^2 + z_{\text{adjusted}}^2}\) is used to solve for the joint angles.

3. **Law of Cosines for \(\theta_2\)**:
   - The law of cosines is used to compute \(\theta_2\), ensuring that the geometry of the manipulator is correctly modeled.

4. **Angle Decomposition for \(\theta_1\)**:
   - The angle \(\phi\) is the angle to the target in the plane, and \(\psi\) is the contribution from link 2. The difference \(\phi - \psi\) gives \(\theta_1\).

5. **Base Rotation for \(\theta_3\)**:
   - The angle \(\theta_3\) is computed as the rotation around the base (z-axis), which aligns the manipulator with the target in the \(xy\)-plane.

### Next Steps
This revised code should now correctly compute the joint angles for the entire kinematic chain. If there are still issues, I will analyze the feedback and refine the solution further.
