The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is failing to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions. The discrepancies between the expected and computed joint values suggest that the geometric relationships and transformations in the code are not being handled correctly. Let's analyze the issues and refine the solution.

---

### Key Observations from Feedback
1. **Incorrect Joint Values**:
   - The computed joint values are significantly different from the correct joint values, indicating that the geometric relationships between the joints and the target position are not being properly accounted for.

2. **Zero Values for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - In many cases, \( \theta_2 \) is computed as zero, which is incorrect. This suggests that the calculation of \( \theta_2 \) is flawed, likely due to an incorrect understanding of the geometry or a missing transformation.

3. **Incorrect TCP Position**:
   - The TCP positions reached by the computed joint values are far from the target positions, indicating that the forward kinematics relationships are not being properly inverted.

---

### Root Causes
1. **Incorrect Geometry**:
   - The current implementation does not properly account for the offsets and rotations introduced by each joint. Specifically, the relationship between the joints and the target position is not being correctly modeled.

2. **Incorrect Use of Law of Cosines**:
   - The calculation of \( \theta_2 \) using the law of cosines is likely incorrect because it does not properly account for the offsets and rotations of the manipulator.

3. **Missing Transformations**:
   - The current implementation does not include the necessary transformations to account for the rotations and translations introduced by each joint.

---

### Revised Approach
To fix these issues, we need to carefully model the geometry of the manipulator and compute the joint angles step by step. Here's the revised approach:

1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - \( \theta_1 \) is the angle of the first joint, which rotates about the Z-axis. It can be computed using the target position in the XY-plane.

2. **Transform the Target Position**:
   - After computing \( \theta_1 \), transform the target position into the coordinate frame of the second joint. This involves applying a rotation about the Z-axis by \( \theta_1 \).

3. **Solve for \( \theta_3 \)**:
   - Use the transformed target position to compute \( \theta_3 \), the angle of the third joint. This involves considering the geometry of the manipulator and the offsets introduced by the links.

4. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Finally, compute \( \theta_2 \), the angle of the second joint, using the transformed target position and the computed value of \( \theta_3 \).

### Updated Code
Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.13585  # Distance from base to joint 2 along Y-axis
    d2 = 0.425    # Distance from joint 2 to joint 3 along Z-axis
    d3 = 0.39225  # Distance from joint 3 to TCP along Z-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Transform the target position into the frame of joint 2
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in XY plane
    z2 = z - d3  # Subtract the TCP offset along Z-axis

    # Step 2: Solve for theta3
    # Using the law of cosines
    L = math.sqrt(r**2 + (z2 - d1)**2)  # Distance from joint 2 to target
    cos_theta3 = (d2**2 + d3**2 - L**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)

    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))

    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2
    # Using the law of cosines again
    cos_theta2 = (d2**2 + L**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * L)

    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))

    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Adjust theta2 based on the position of the target
    if z2 < d1:
        theta2 = -theta2

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Key Changes
1. **Transformation of Target Position**:
   - The target position is transformed into the coordinate frame of the second joint by subtracting the TCP offset and computing the radial distance.

2. **Correct Use of Law of Cosines**:
   - The law of cosines is used to compute both \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \), with proper clamping to handle numerical inaccuracies.

3. **Adjustment of \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - The sign of \( \theta_2 \) is adjusted based on the position of the target relative to the second joint.
