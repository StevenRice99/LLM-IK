The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is failing to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions. The primary issues are:

1. **`theta2` is always computed as `0`**:
   - This is a critical issue. The current implementation does not properly compute `theta2` based on the geometry of the manipulator. This results in incorrect joint angles and positions.

2. **`theta3` is not properly computed**:
   - The calculation of `theta3` does not account for the contributions of `theta1` and `theta2` to the final position of the TCP.

3. **General Misalignment**:
   - The positions reached by the manipulator are significantly off from the target positions, indicating that the forward kinematics model used in the inverse kinematics calculations is not being properly inverted.

---

### Plan to Fix the Issues:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - Use the full geometry of the manipulator, including all link lengths and offsets, to compute the joint angles.

2. **Update `theta2` Calculation**:
   - Properly compute `theta2` using the law of cosines and the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Update `theta3` Calculation**:
   - Properly compute `theta3` based on the contributions of `theta1` and `theta2`.

4. **Verify Forward Kinematics**:
   - Ensure that the forward kinematics model matches the manipulator's actual geometry.

### Updated Code:
Here is the revised implementation of the inverse kinematics function:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    l1 = 0.13585  # Offset of link 2 along y-axis
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    r = math.sqrt(x_d**2 + y_d**2)  # Distance in the xy-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y_d, x_d)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2
    z_adjusted = z_d - l3  # Adjust for the TCP offset
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_adjusted**2)  # Distance to the target position
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle between the links
    alpha = math.atan2(z_adjusted, r)  # Angle to the target position
    beta = math.asin((l2 * math.sin(theta2)) / d)  # Angle contribution from link 2
    theta3 = alpha - beta

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`theta1`**:
   - Computed as the angle in the xy-plane to align the manipulator with the target position.

2. **`theta2`**:
   - Computed using the law of cosines to determine the angle between the first two links.

3. **`theta3`**:
   - Computed as the angle needed to align the TCP with the target position, taking into account the contributions of `theta1` and `theta2`.

4. **Clamping**:
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to ensure numerical stability.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated function against the provided test cases.
- If further issues arise, analyze the forward kinematics model and ensure it matches the manipulator's geometry.
