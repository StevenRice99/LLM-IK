To solve the inverse kinematics for the full 3-DOF manipulator, we need to extend the provided solution for the first two joints to include the third joint. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Understand the Target Position**: The target position `p` is given as `[x, y, z]`. This is the position of the TCP (Tool Center Point) in the global frame.

2. **Account for the TCP Offset**: The TCP is offset by `[0, 0, 0.39225]` from the end of the third link. To find the position of the end of the third link, we subtract this offset from the target position `p`.

3. **Solve for the First Two Joints**: Use the provided solution for the first two joints to calculate `theta1` and `theta2` based on the adjusted position of the third link.

4. **Solve for the Third Joint**: The third joint's rotation, `theta3`, is determined by the remaining distance along the z-axis after accounting for the contributions of the first two joints.

Now, I will implement the solution in the Python function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Adjust for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.39225
    z_adjusted = z - tcp_offset

    # Step 2: Solve for the first two joints using the provided solution
    theta2 = math.acos(z_adjusted / 0.425)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Step 3: Solve for the third joint
    # The z contribution from the first two joints is given by:
    z_contribution = 0.425 * cos_theta2
    # The remaining distance to cover is:
    z_remaining = z_adjusted - z_contribution
    # The third joint's contribution is along its length (0.425)
    theta3 = math.acos(z_remaining / 0.425)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` required to position the TCP at the given target position `p`. It uses the provided solution for the first two joints and extends it to include the third joint.
