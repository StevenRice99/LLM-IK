The error indicates that the value passed to `math.acos` is outside its valid domain, which is \([-1, 1]\). This happens because the calculation of `cos_theta2` in the code is incorrect or results in a value outside this range due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect assumptions.

### Root Cause:
The calculation of `cos_theta2` is:
```python
cos_theta2 = (z_d - 0.39225) / 0.425
```
Here, `z_d` is the target z-coordinate, and `0.39225` is the offset of the TCP from the end of the third link. If the target z-coordinate `z_d` is not properly adjusted or is too far from the reachable range of the manipulator, the value of `cos_theta2` can exceed the range \([-1, 1]\), causing the `math.acos` function to fail.

### Solution:
1. **Clamp `cos_theta2` to the Valid Range**:
   To ensure numerical stability, we can clamp the value of `cos_theta2` to the range \([-1, 1]\) before passing it to `math.acos`.

2. **Revisit the Calculation**:
   Ensure that the calculation of `cos_theta2` properly accounts for the manipulator's geometry and the TCP offset.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_d, y_d, z_d = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 and theta2
    # Adjust z_d for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z_d - 0.39225

    # Calculate cos(theta2) and clamp it to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = z_adjusted / 0.425
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]

    # Compute theta2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Compute theta1
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615
    denominator = A ** 2 + B ** 2
    C = (A * x_d + B * y_d) / denominator
    S = (-B * x_d + A * y_d) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(S, C)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta3
    # The z-component of the TCP is affected by theta3
    z_reach = 0.425 * math.cos(theta2) + 0.39225  # Total z-reach from theta2 and TCP offset
    theta3 = math.atan2(z_d - z_reach, 0)  # Align the TCP along the z-axis

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`**:
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
     ```
   - This ensures that `math.acos` always receives a valid input.

2. **Adjusted `z_d`**:
   - The target z-coordinate `z_d` is adjusted by subtracting the TCP offset (`0.39225`) to correctly compute the contribution of the second link.

### Why This Works:
- Clamping ensures numerical stability and prevents invalid inputs to `math.acos`.
- Adjusting `z_d` accounts for the TCP offset, ensuring the calculation aligns with the manipulator's geometry.

This updated function should now handle all valid inputs without encountering a `math domain error`.
