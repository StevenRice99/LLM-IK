The error indicates that the value passed to `math.acos` is outside the valid range of `[-1, 1]`. This happens because the calculation of `z_adjusted / 0.425` results in a value that is either less than -1 or greater than 1, which is mathematically invalid for the `acos` function.

### Root Cause
The issue arises because the adjusted `z` value (`z_adjusted`) might not be properly constrained to the range of motion of the manipulator. Specifically:
- The length of the second link is `0.425`, and the `acos` function is used to compute the angle `theta2` based on the ratio `z_adjusted / 0.425`.
- If `z_adjusted` is greater than `0.425` or less than `-0.425`, the ratio will exceed the valid range for `acos`.

### Solution
To fix this, we need to ensure that the value passed to `math.acos` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]`. This can be done using Python's `min` and `max` functions.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Adjust for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.39225
    z_adjusted = z - tcp_offset

    # Step 2: Solve for the first two joints using the provided solution
    # Clamp z_adjusted / 0.425 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    ratio = z_adjusted / 0.425
    ratio = max(-1, min(1, ratio))  # Clamp the ratio to the valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(ratio)
    sin_theta2 = math.sin(theta2)
    cos_theta2 = math.cos(theta2)
    K = 0.425 * sin_theta2
    L = 0.01615
    denominator = K ** 2 + L ** 2
    cos_theta1 = (K * x + L * y) / denominator
    sin_theta1 = (-L * x + K * y) / denominator
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)

    # Step 3: Solve for the third joint
    # The z contribution from the first two joints is given by:
    z_contribution = 0.425 * cos_theta2
    # The remaining distance to cover is:
    z_remaining = z_adjusted - z_contribution
    # Clamp z_remaining / 0.425 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    ratio3 = z_remaining / 0.425
    ratio3 = max(-1, min(1, ratio3))  # Clamp the ratio to the valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(ratio3)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Clamping the Ratio for `math.acos`**:
   - Before calling `math.acos`, the ratio (`z_adjusted / 0.425` or `z_remaining / 0.425`) is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` using `max(-1, min(1, ratio))`.
   - This ensures that the input to `math.acos` is always valid, preventing the "math domain error".

2. **General Robustness**:
   - The clamping ensures that even if the target position is slightly outside the manipulator's workspace due to numerical precision or rounding errors, the function will still return a valid result.

### Next Steps
You can now test the updated code. It should handle all valid inputs without encountering the "math domain error". If further issues arise, they might be related to other parts of the kinematic chain or assumptions about the manipulator's geometry.
