The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics function is failing to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issues seem to be:

1. **Incorrect computation of joint angles**: The computed joint angles do not match the correct values, leading to incorrect TCP positions.
2. **Failure to account for the full range of solutions**: The function does not consider all possible configurations of the manipulator, which may result in incorrect or incomplete solutions.
3. **Improper handling of joint dependencies**: The relationship between \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) is not being handled correctly, leading to errors in the computed positions.

### Plan for Refinement
To address these issues, I will:
1. Revisit the forward kinematics to ensure the geometric relationships are correctly understood.
2. Correctly compute \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) using the law of cosines and trigonometric relationships.
3. Ensure the function accounts for the full range of solutions and properly handles joint dependencies.

### Updated Code
I will now refine the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Compute the effective position in the YZ-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    z_eff = z - l3            # Effective Z position after accounting for TCP offset

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + (z_eff - l1)**2)  # Distance to the target point

    # Law of cosines for theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0))  # Clip to handle numerical errors

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_eff - l1, r)
    beta = np.arcsin((l3 * np.sin(theta3)) / d)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Adjust theta3 to account for the correct direction
    theta3 = -theta3

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Changes Made
1. **Adjusted \( \theta_3 \)**: The sign of \( \theta_3 \) was adjusted to account for the correct direction of rotation.
2. **Improved trigonometric relationships**: The computation of \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) was refined to ensure accuracy.

### Next Steps
This updated function should now compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
