To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = [x, y, z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is determined by the contributions of the three revolute joints. The positions of the links and the TCP are given in the table. The TCP position is influenced by:
- Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)): Rotation about the Z-axis.
- Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)): Rotation about the Y-axis.
- Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \)): Rotation about the Y-axis.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The TCP position can be expressed as a function of the joint angles:
1. Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)) determines the rotation in the XY-plane.
2. Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)) and Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \)) determine the position along the Z-axis and the projection in the YZ-plane.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint rotates about the Z-axis, so:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joints contribute to the position in the YZ-plane. Using the geometry of the manipulator:
1. Compute the effective position in the YZ-plane after accounting for Joint 1's rotation.
2. Use trigonometry and the link lengths to solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \).

### Step 5: Write the Code
Now, I will implement the inverse kinematics function based on the above analysis.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Compute the effective position in the YZ-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    z_eff = z - l3            # Effective Z position after accounting for TCP offset

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + (z_eff - l1)**2)  # Distance to the target point
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)  # Law of cosines

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_eff - l1, r)
    beta = np.arcsin((l3 * np.sin(theta3)) / d)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
