To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = [x, y, z] \). Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is determined by the contributions of the three revolute joints. The positions and orientations of the links are given in the table. The axes of rotation for the joints are:
- Joint 1: Rotates about the Z-axis.
- Joint 2: Rotates about the Y-axis.
- Joint 3: Rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by the cumulative transformations of these joints.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) can be expressed in terms of the joint angles:
1. Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)) determines the rotation about the Z-axis, affecting the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates.
2. Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)) and Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \)) determine the position along the \( z \)-axis and the projection in the \( xz \)-plane.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) can be calculated using the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of the target position:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joint angles (\( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)) can be solved using the geometry of the manipulator. The effective length of the arm in the \( xz \)-plane is:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
The vertical position of the TCP is \( z \).

Using the link lengths and the target position, we can apply trigonometry and the law of cosines to solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \).

### Step 5: Write the Code
Now, I will implement the inverse kinematics function based on the above analysis:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Effective distance in the xz-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_eff = z - l1  # Adjust for the height of the first link

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_eff**2)  # Distance to the target point
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Law of cosines

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_eff, r)
    beta = math.acos((l2**2 + d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d))
    theta2 = alpha + beta

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
