To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Define the problem
The robot has three revolute joints:
1. Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
2. Joint 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
3. Joint 3 rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by the transformations contributed by each joint and link. The forward kinematics equations describe the TCP position as a function of the joint angles. The inverse kinematics process involves solving these equations to find the joint angles for a given TCP position.

### Step 2: Analyze the forward kinematics
From the forward kinematics results, the TCP position is:
\[
\text{TCP} = [x_\text{TCP}, y_\text{TCP}, z_\text{TCP}]
\]
The transformations are cumulative, starting from the base frame to the TCP. The position of the TCP can be expressed as:
\[
\text{TCP} = T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot \text{TCP}_{\text{local}}
\]
where \( T_1 \), \( T_2 \), and \( T_3 \) are the transformation matrices for each joint.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint rotates about the Z-axis. The projection of the target position \( p \) onto the XY-plane determines \( \theta_1 \):
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joints rotate about the Y-axis. To solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \), we consider the geometry of the manipulator:
1. Compute the effective length of the arm in the XY-plane and along the Z-axis.
2. Use trigonometry to solve for the angles.

The effective length of the arm is:
\[
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
The vertical displacement is:
\[
z_{\text{eff}} = z - \text{offset}_\text{TCP}
\]
where \( \text{offset}_\text{TCP} = 0.39225 \) (from the TCP position in the local frame).

Using the link lengths and the effective position, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) using the law of cosines.

### Step 5: Implement the solution
Now, I will implement the inverse kinematics function based on the above analysis.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of the TCP offset
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Effective position in the plane of joint 2 and joint 3
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    z_eff = z - l3              # Effective Z position
    
    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_eff**2)  # Distance to the target from joint 2
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Law of cosines
    
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)  # Sine of theta3
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_eff, r) - math.atan2(l2 * sin_theta3, l1 + l2 * cos_theta3)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
