To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is determined by the contributions of the three revolute joints. The positions of the links and the TCP are given in the table. The TCP position is influenced by:
- Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)): Rotation about the Z-axis.
- Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)): Rotation about the Y-axis.
- Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \)): Rotation about the Y-axis.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The TCP position can be expressed as a function of the joint angles:
1. Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)) determines the rotation in the XY-plane.
2. Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)) and Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \)) determine the position along the Z-axis and the reach in the YZ-plane.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the projection of the target position \( p \) onto the XY-plane:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joint angles are determined by the geometry of the manipulator in the YZ-plane. Using the link lengths and the target position, we can apply trigonometry to solve for these angles.

### Step 5: Write the Code
Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of the TCP offset

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Project the target position onto the YZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the XY-plane
    z_offset = z - l3           # Adjust for the TCP offset

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_offset**2)  # Distance to the target in the YZ-plane
    alpha = math.atan2(z_offset, r)    # Angle to the target in the YZ-plane

    # Law of cosines to find the angles
    cos_beta = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)  # Angle at joint 2

    cos_gamma = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    gamma = math.acos(cos_gamma)  # Angle at joint 3

    # Joint angles
    theta2 = alpha + beta
    theta3 = math.pi - gamma

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
