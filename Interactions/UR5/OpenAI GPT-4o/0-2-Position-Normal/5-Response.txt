The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the valid range for the `math.acos` function, which is \([-1, 1]\). This can happen due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the formula for `cos_theta3`.

Let me carefully revisit the formula for `cos_theta3` and ensure that it is computed correctly. Additionally, I will clamp the value of `cos_theta3` to the valid range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid such errors.

### Step 1: Revisiting the Formula for \( \cos(\theta_3) \)
The formula for \( \cos(\theta_3) \) is derived from the law of cosines:
\[
\cos(\theta_3) = \frac{d^2 - l_2^2 - l_3^2}{2 \cdot l_2 \cdot l_3}
\]
where:
- \( d \) is the distance from the base to the target position in 3D space.
- \( l_2 \) and \( l_3 \) are the lengths of the second and third links.

### Step 2: Clamping \( \cos(\theta_3) \)
To ensure numerical stability, I will clamp \( \cos(\theta_3) \) to the range \([-1, 1]\) before passing it to `math.acos`.

### Step 3: Updated Code
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Effective distance in the xz-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_eff = z - l1  # Adjust for the height of the first link

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_eff**2)  # Distance to the target point

    # Compute cos(theta3) and clamp to [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Law of cosines

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_eff, r)
    beta = math.acos((l2**2 + d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d))
    theta2 = alpha + beta

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Clamping \( \cos(\theta_3) \):**
   - The value of \( \cos(\theta_3) \) is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
     ```
   - This ensures that the input to `math.acos` is always valid, preventing the `ValueError`.

2. **Numerical Stability:**
   - The clamping step accounts for any small numerical inaccuracies that might cause \( \cos(\theta_3) \) to slightly exceed the valid range.

### Step 4: Testing
This updated code should now handle all valid inputs without encountering the `math domain error`. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
