It seems that the forward kinematics results are consistent. I will now proceed to derive the inverse kinematics solution for the given manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - The manipulator has 3 revolute joints with axes Z, Y, and Y respectively.
   - The task is to compute the joint angles \((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)\) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at a given target position \(p = [x, y, z]\).

2. **Kinematic Chain**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by the joint angles and the link lengths.
   - The forward kinematics equation can be expressed as:
     \[
     p = T_1(\theta_1) \cdot T_2(\theta_2) \cdot T_3(\theta_3) \cdot [0, 0, 0.39225, 1]^T
     \]
     where \(T_i(\theta_i)\) are the transformation matrices for each joint.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - To solve for \(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3\), we decompose the problem:
     - \(\theta_1\): Determines the rotation about the Z-axis.
     - \(\theta_2, \theta_3\): Determine the position in the Y-Z plane.

4. **Plan**:
   - Use geometric relationships to solve for \(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3\).
   - Incorporate the link offsets and lengths into the equations.

Now, I will implement the solution in Python.

### Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.13585  # Offset along Y for Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    d3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using geometric relationships
    # Project the target position onto the Y-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the X-Y plane
    z_eff = z - d3              # Effective Z position after accounting for TCP offset
    y_eff = r - d1              # Effective Y position after accounting for Revolute 2 offset

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for theta2 and theta3
    D = (y_eff**2 + z_eff**2 - d2**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)
    theta3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)  # Elbow-up solution

    # Solve for theta2
    phi2 = math.atan2(z_eff, y_eff)
    phi1 = math.atan2(d3 * math.sin(theta3), d2 + d3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = phi2 - phi1

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function computes the joint angles \((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)\) required to position the TCP at the given target position \(p = [x, y, z]\).
