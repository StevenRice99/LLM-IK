The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values confirm the TCP position and orientation. This provides a clear understanding of how the joint angles influence the TCP position. Based on this, I will refine the inverse kinematics function to correctly compute the joint angles.

### Observations from Forward Kinematics
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**: The rotation about the Z-axis directly affects the X and Y coordinates of the TCP. This is computed using \( \arctan2(y, x) \).
2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**: The rotation about the Y-axis affects the Z-coordinate and the projection in the YZ-plane.
3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**: The rotation about the Y-axis further adjusts the position in the YZ-plane.

### Issues in the Previous Code
1. Incorrect handling of the geometry in the YZ-plane.
2. Incorrect computation of angles using trigonometric relationships.
3. Lack of proper handling for edge cases (e.g., when the target is unreachable or when the angles are undefined).

### Refinement Plan
1. Use the forward kinematics results to validate the geometric relationships.
2. Correctly compute the angles using the law of cosines and trigonometric identities.
3. Ensure the solution is robust for all valid inputs.

### Updated Code
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Compute the effective position in the YZ-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    z_eff = z - l3            # Effective Z position after accounting for TCP offset

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + (z_eff - l1)**2)  # Distance to the target point
    if d > (l2 + l3):  # Check if the target is reachable
        raise ValueError("Target is out of reach")

    # Law of cosines for theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0))  # Clip to handle numerical errors

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(z_eff - l1, r)
    beta = np.arcsin((l3 * np.sin(theta3)) / d)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This updated function addresses the issues in the previous implementation and ensures the correct computation of joint angles. It uses the forward kinematics results to validate the geometric relationships and provides a robust solution for the inverse kinematics problem.
