The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics solution is not producing correct joint values, leading to incorrect TCP positions. This suggests that there are fundamental issues in the implementation of the inverse kinematics equations. I will carefully analyze the problem and revise the solution.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Issues
1. **Incorrect Joint Angles:**
   - The joint angles produced by the code are significantly different from the correct joint angles.
   - This suggests that the geometric relationships between the joints and the target position are not being correctly modeled.

2. **Incorrect TCP Position:**
   - The TCP positions reached by the robot are far from the target positions.
   - This indicates that the forward kinematics relationships are not being properly inverted.

3. **Potential Causes:**
   - The calculation of \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) may not correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator.
   - The clamping of values (e.g., \( \cos(\theta_3) \) and \( \cos(\beta) \)) may be masking deeper issues in the equations.

---

### Step 2: Revisit the Inverse Kinematics Equations
The manipulator has three revolute joints:
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)):**
   - Rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Determines the orientation of the arm in the XY-plane.

2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)):**
   - Rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Determines the elevation of the arm and the position of the TCP in the XZ-plane.

3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \)):**
   - Rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Determines the extension of the arm and the position of the TCP in the XZ-plane.

The TCP position is influenced by the cumulative transformations of these joints. The goal is to solve for \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) such that the TCP reaches the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \).

---

### Step 3: Correct the Equations
1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \):**
   - The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
     \]

2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \):**
   - The second and third joint angles are determined by the geometry of the manipulator in the XZ-plane.
   - The effective length of the arm in the XZ-plane is:
     \[
     r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
     \]
   - The vertical position of the TCP is:
     \[
     z_{\text{eff}} = z - l_1
     \]
   - The distance from the base to the target position is:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{r^2 + z_{\text{eff}}^2}
     \]
   - Using the law of cosines, \( \theta_3 \) is given by:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_3) = \frac{d^2 - l_2^2 - l_3^2}{2 \cdot l_2 \cdot l_3}
     \]
     \[
     \theta_3 = \arccos(\cos(\theta_3))
     \]
   - The angle \( \theta_2 \) is given by:
     \[
     \alpha = \arctan2(z_{\text{eff}}, r)
     \]
     \[
     \beta = \arccos\left(\frac{l_2^2 + d^2 - l_3^2}{2 \cdot l_2 \cdot d}\right)
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \alpha + \beta
     \]

---

### Step 4: Implement the Corrected Code
Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Effective distance in the xz-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    z_eff = z - l1  # Adjust for the height of the first link

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using trigonometry
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + z_eff**2)  # Distance to the target point

    # Compute cos(theta3) and clamp to [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Law of cosines

    # Compute cos(beta) and clamp to [-1, 1]
    cos_beta = (l2**2 + d**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d)
    cos_beta = max(-1, min(1, cos_beta))  # Clamp to valid range
    beta = math.acos(cos_beta)

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(z_eff, r)
    theta2 = alpha + beta

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
This corrected implementation should now produce joint angles that correctly position the TCP at the target position. If further issues arise, I will analyze the feedback and refine the solution further. Let me know how it performs!
