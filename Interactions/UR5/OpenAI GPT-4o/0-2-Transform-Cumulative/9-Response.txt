It seems there is a repetition of the same forward kinematics data. Let me proceed with solving the inverse kinematics problem based on the provided details and existing solutions.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:
   - Use the existing solution for joint 1 to calculate its angle based on the target position `p`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**:
   - Use the existing solution for joint 2 to calculate its angle based on the target position `p` adjusted for the contribution of joint 1.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**:
   - Use the existing solution for joint 3 to calculate its angle based on the target position `p` adjusted for the contributions of joints 1 and 2.

4. Combine the results into a tuple and return.

Now, I will proceed to implement the solution.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Adjust the target position for Joint 2 by removing the contribution of Joint 1
    x2 = x
    y2 = y - 0.13585  # Offset of Revolute 2 in the y-direction
    z2 = z

    # Solve for Joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2)

    # Adjust the target position for Joint 3 by removing the contributions of Joints 1 and 2
    x3 = x2
    y3 = y2 + 0.1197  # Offset of Revolute 3 in the y-direction
    z3 = z2 - 0.425   # Offset of Revolute 3 in the z-direction

    # Solve for Joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(x3, z3)

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```
