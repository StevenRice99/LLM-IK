The forward kinematics results confirm the correct joint values for the given target position and orientation. I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to ensure it can compute the correct joint values for all targets.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results show the correct transformation of joint angles to the target position and orientation.
2. The current inverse kinematics function fails because it does not properly account for the geometry and offsets of the manipulator's links.

### Plan for Revision:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:
   - Use the target position `p` to compute the angle for joint 1, considering the manipulator's geometry.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**:
   - Adjust the target position to account for the contribution of joint 1 and compute the angle for joint 2.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**:
   - Further adjust the target position to account for the contributions of joints 1 and 2, and compute the angle for joint 3.

4. **Orientation**:
   - Ensure the computed joint angles align with the target orientation.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function accordingly:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Adjust position for joint 2
    d1 = 0.13585  # Offset of joint 2
    x2 = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - d1
    z2 = z

    # Solve for joint 2
    d2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    d3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)
    r2 = math.sqrt(x2**2 + z2**2)
    phi2 = math.atan2(z2, x2)
    phi1 = math.acos((d2**2 + r2**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * r2))
    theta2 = phi2 - phi1

    # Solve for joint 3
    phi3 = math.acos((d2**2 + d3**2 - r2**2) / (2 * d2 * d3))
    theta3 = math.pi - phi3

    # Adjust for orientation
    theta3 = theta3 - pitch  # Adjust for target pitch

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This revised function incorporates the geometry of the manipulator and adjusts for the target orientation. It uses trigonometric relationships to compute the joint angles based on the target position and orientation.
