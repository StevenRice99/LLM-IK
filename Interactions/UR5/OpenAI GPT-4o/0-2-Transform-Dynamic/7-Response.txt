It seems that the forward kinematics results are consistent and provide the same output. I will now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function based on the given details and the existing solutions.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:
   - Use the existing solution for joint 1 to calculate the angle based on the target position `p`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**:
   - Use the existing solution for joint 2 to calculate the angle based on the target position `p` adjusted for the contribution of joint 1.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**:
   - Use the existing solution for joint 3 to calculate the angle based on the target position `p` adjusted for the contributions of joints 1 and 2.

4. **Return the calculated joint angles**.

Here is the completed function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Adjust position for joint 2
    x2 = x
    y2 = y - 0.13585  # Offset of joint 2
    z2 = z

    # Solve for joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x2, z2)

    # Adjust position for joint 3
    x3 = x2
    y3 = y2 + 0.1197  # Offset of joint 3
    z3 = z2 - 0.425   # Offset of joint 3

    # Solve for joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(x3, z3)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to reach the target position `p` and orientation `r`. Note that the orientation `r` is not explicitly used in this solution because the manipulator's orientation is fixed along the Z-axis.
