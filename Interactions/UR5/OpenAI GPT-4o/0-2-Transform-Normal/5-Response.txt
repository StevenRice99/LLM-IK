To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions of each link and the TCP. The TCP position is influenced by the joint angles of the revolute joints. The revolute joints have the following characteristics:
- Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
- Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
- Revolute 3 rotates about the Y-axis.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The TCP position is given by:
\[
p_{TCP} = [x, y, z]
\]
We need to solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) such that the forward kinematics matches the desired TCP position.

### Step 3: Use Geometry to Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint, Revolute 1, rotates about the Z-axis. This means that the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of the TCP are influenced by \( \theta_1 \). Specifically:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joints, Revolute 2 and Revolute 3, rotate about the Y-axis. These joints determine the \( z \)-coordinate and the projection of the TCP in the \( xz \)-plane. Using the geometry of the manipulator, we can derive equations for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) based on the lengths of the links and the desired TCP position.

### Step 5: Write the Solution
Using the above steps, we can write the Python function to compute the joint angles.

Here is the completed function:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the desired position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3 (TCP offset)
    
    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using geometry
    # Compute the wrist center position
    wx = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Projection in the xz-plane
    wz = z - l1                # Adjust for the height of link 1
    
    # Compute the distance to the wrist center
    d = np.sqrt(wx**2 + wz**2)
    
    # Law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Law of cosines to find theta2
    alpha = np.arctan2(wz, wx)  # Angle to the wrist center
    beta = np.arctan2(l3 * np.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * np.cos(theta3))  # Offset due to link 3
    theta2 = alpha - beta
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to position the TCP at the desired location \( p \). Note that the orientation \( r \) is not used in this solution because the manipulator's degrees of freedom only allow for positioning, not arbitrary orientation.
