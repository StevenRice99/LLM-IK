The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still failing to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The discrepancies suggest that there are fundamental issues in the geometric modeling and kinematic calculations. To address this, I will carefully analyze the problem and revise the solution.

---

### Observations from Feedback:
1. **Systematic Errors**:
   - The reached positions are consistently incorrect, indicating that the geometric relationships between the links and the target position are not being modeled correctly.

2. **Incorrect Joint Angles**:
   - The joint angles produced by the code are significantly different from the correct joint angles, suggesting that the inverse kinematics calculations are flawed.

3. **TCP Offset Adjustment**:
   - The adjustment for the TCP offset `[0, 0.093, 0]` may not be applied correctly, leading to errors in the calculations.

4. **Planar Geometry**:
   - The calculations for Joints 2 and 3 in the Y-Z plane may not be correctly accounting for the manipulator's geometry.

---

### Revised Plan:
1. **Revisit TCP Offset Adjustment**:
   - Ensure that the target position is correctly adjusted for the TCP offset.

2. **Recompute Joints 2 and 3**:
   - Use the law of cosines and planar geometry in the Y-Z plane to compute the angles for Joints 2 and 3.

3. **Recompute Joint 1**:
   - Use the X-Y position of the target to compute the angle for Joint 1.

4. **Fix Joint 4**:
   - Set Joint 4 to `0` since it does not contribute to the position of the TCP in the given scenarios.

5. **Validate Geometry**:
   - Carefully validate the geometric relationships between the links and the target position.

### Revised Code:
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Adjust for TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset  # Adjust y-coordinate for TCP offset
    z_adj = z

    # Step 2: Solve for Joints 2 and 3
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 3
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 4
    d = math.sqrt(y_adj**2 + z_adj**2)  # Distance in the Y-Z plane

    # Law of cosines to find angle for Joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Solve for Joint 2 using geometry
    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj, z_adj)  # Angle to target in Y-Z plane
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))  # Offset due to link lengths
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 4: Fix Joint 4 to 0
    theta4 = 0

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Key Changes:
1. **TCP Offset Adjustment**:
   - The target position is adjusted for the TCP offset `[0, 0.093, 0]` to ensure that the calculations are based on the correct reference point.

2. **Clamped `cos_theta3`**:
   - The value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range `[-1, 1]` to avoid `math domain errors`.

3. **Revised Geometry for Joints 2 and 3**:
   - The angles for Joints 2 and 3 are computed using the law of cosines and planar geometry in the Y-Z plane.

4. **Simplified Joint 1 Calculation**:
   - The angle for Joint 1 is computed based on the X-Y position of the target.

5. **Fixed Joint 4**:
   - Joint 4 is set to `0` since it does not contribute to the position of the TCP in the given scenarios.

### Expected Improvements:
- The revised code should now correctly compute the joint angles for all valid target positions.
- The manipulator should reach the target positions accurately when the computed joint angles are used in forward kinematics.

Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
