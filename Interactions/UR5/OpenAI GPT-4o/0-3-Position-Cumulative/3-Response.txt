To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator, I will now complete the Python function step by step. The goal is to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) required to position the TCP at the given target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (θ1)**: Use the x and y coordinates of the target position to calculate the rotation about the Z-axis.
2. **Joint 2 (θ2)**: Use the z coordinate and the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane to calculate the rotation about the Y-axis.
3. **Joint 3 (θ3)**: Use the geometry of the manipulator to calculate the rotation about the Y-axis for the third joint.
4. **Joint 4 (θ4)**: Use the remaining offset along the Y-axis to calculate the final rotation about the Y-axis.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    d3 = 0.093  # Offset of the TCP along Y-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x_target, y_target)

    # Step 2: Adjust target position for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target - d3

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2 and θ3 (Joints 2 and 3)
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    cos_theta3 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3 ** 2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = phi - beta

    # Step 4: Solve for θ4 (Joint 4)
    theta4 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta2 - theta3

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the given target position \( p \). It uses trigonometric relationships and the geometry of the manipulator to determine the angles for each joint.
