To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator, I will now analyze the problem step by step and complete the Python function.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 4 Contribution**:
   - The TCP is offset by `[0, 0.093, 0]` from the end of Revolute 4. This means the target position `p` must first be adjusted to account for this offset.

2. **Joint 3 and Joint 4**:
   - Using the adjusted target position, compute the angles for Joint 3 and Joint 4. This involves solving for the planar geometry in the Y-Z plane.

3. **Joint 2**:
   - With the position of Joint 3 known, compute the angle for Joint 2. This involves solving for the planar geometry in the X-Z plane.

4. **Joint 1**:
   - Finally, compute the angle for Joint 1, which is responsible for rotation about the Z-axis.

I will now implement the solution.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Adjust for TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset  # Adjust y-coordinate for TCP offset
    z_adj = z

    # Step 2: Solve for Joint 3 and Joint 4
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 3
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 4
    d = math.sqrt(y_adj**2 + z_adj**2)  # Distance in the Y-Z plane

    # Law of cosines to find angle for Joint 4
    cos_theta4 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta4 = math.acos(cos_theta4)

    # Solve for Joint 3 using geometry
    alpha = math.atan2(y_adj, z_adj)  # Angle to target in Y-Z plane
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta4), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta4))  # Offset due to link lengths
    theta3 = alpha - beta

    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 2
    x_adj = x  # X-coordinate remains unchanged
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)

    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
