The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function, which is [-1, 1]. This can happen due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the formula for `cos_theta3`. Let's address this issue step by step:

### Root Cause
The formula for `cos_theta3`:
```python
cos_theta3 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
```
can produce a value slightly outside the range [-1, 1] due to floating-point precision errors. When this happens, the `math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3 ** 2)` operation fails because the argument becomes negative, leading to a `ValueError`.

### Solution
To fix this, we need to clamp the value of `cos_theta3` to the range [-1, 1] before calculating `sin_theta3`. This ensures that the square root operation is always valid.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    d3 = 0.093  # Offset of the TCP along Y-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x_target, y_target)

    # Step 2: Adjust target position for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target - d3

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2 and θ3 (Joints 2 and 3)
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    cos_theta3 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)

    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))

    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3 ** 2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(sin_theta3, cos_theta3)

    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta3, d1 + d2 * cos_theta3)
    theta2 = phi - beta

    # Step 4: Solve for θ4 (Joint 4)
    theta4 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta2 - theta3

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Clamping `cos_theta3`**:
   - Before calculating `sin_theta3`, the value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] using:
     ```python
     cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))
     ```
   - This ensures that `math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3 ** 2)` is always valid.

2. **No Other Changes**:
   - The rest of the function remains the same, as the issue was isolated to the calculation of `sin_theta3`.

### Why This Fix Works
Clamping `cos_theta3` prevents numerical errors from causing invalid inputs to the `math.sqrt` function. This is a common practice in robotics and numerical computations when dealing with trigonometric functions.

### Next Steps
You can now test the updated function. It should handle all valid inputs without encountering the `ValueError`. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
