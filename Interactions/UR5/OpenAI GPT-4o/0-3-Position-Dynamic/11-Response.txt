The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function, which is causing a "math domain error." Specifically, the value of `cos_theta2` is likely greater than 1 or less than -1, which is mathematically invalid for trigonometric calculations.

This issue arises because of numerical inaccuracies or incorrect assumptions in the calculation of `cos_theta2`. Let's debug and fix the issue step by step.

---

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **`cos_theta2` Calculation**:
   - `cos_theta2` is calculated as:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 - d_1^2 - d_2^2}{2 \cdot d_1 \cdot d_2}
     \]
   - If the value of `r^2 - d_1^2 - d_2^2` is slightly larger or smaller than \( 2 \cdot d_1 \cdot d_2 \), due to floating-point precision errors, `cos_theta2` can exceed the valid range of \([-1, 1]\).

2. **Fix**:
   - Clamp the value of `cos_theta2` to the range \([-1, 1]\) before calculating `sin_theta2` using `math.sqrt`.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected implementation with the fix applied:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (theta_1)
    theta_1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Adjust target position for Joint 2 and Joint 3 calculations
    d3 = 0.093  # Offset from TCP to Revolute 4
    y_adjusted = y - d3  # Adjust y position for the offset

    # Step 3: Solve for Joints 2 and 3 (theta_2, theta_3)
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 3
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 4
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the x-z plane

    # Calculate cos_theta2 and clamp it to the range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]

    # Calculate sin_theta2
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)
    theta_2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Calculate theta_3
    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta_3 = phi - beta

    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (theta_4)
    # Assuming the orientation of the end effector is aligned with the z-axis
    theta_4 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta_2

    return theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`**:
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
     ```
   - This ensures that `math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)` is always valid, avoiding the "math domain error."

2. **Numerical Stability**:
   - Clamping accounts for small numerical inaccuracies that can occur due to floating-point arithmetic, especially when the target position is near the limits of the robot's workspace.
