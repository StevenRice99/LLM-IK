The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the valid range for the `math.acos` function, which is [-1, 1]. This can happen due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the formula for `cos_theta2`.

To fix this issue, I will clamp the value of `cos_theta2` to the range [-1, 1] before passing it to `math.acos`. This ensures that the function does not encounter a domain error.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for Joint 1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Adjust the target position to account for the rotation of Joint 1
    # Rotate the target position back to the frame of Joint 2
    x_adj = x * math.cos(theta1) + y * math.sin(theta1)
    y_adj = -x * math.sin(theta1) + y * math.cos(theta1)
    z_adj = z

    # Adjust for the TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    y_adj -= tcp_offset

    # Solve for Joints 2, 3, and 4 using EXISTING 2
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)

    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))

    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta3))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Joint 4 is assumed to be 0 as per EXISTING 2
    theta4 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`**: The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] using `max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))`. This ensures that the input to `math.acos` is always valid, even if there are small numerical inaccuracies in the calculation of `cos_theta2`.

2. **No Other Changes**: The rest of the code remains the same, as the issue was specifically related to the domain error in `math.acos`.

This fix should resolve the error and allow the function to compute the joint angles correctly for all valid inputs.
