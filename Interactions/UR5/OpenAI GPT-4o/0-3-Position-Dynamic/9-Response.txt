It seems there is a misunderstanding or repetition in the interaction. Let me proceed with solving the inverse kinematics problem step by step.

To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
   - Use the provided solution for Joint 1 (Existing Code 1) to calculate \( \theta_1 \) based on the target position \( p \).

2. **Joints 2 and 3 (\( \theta_2, \theta_3 \))**:
   - Use the provided solution for Joints 3 to 5 (Existing Code 2) to calculate \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \). This solution assumes the TCP position is adjusted for the offsets of the links.

3. **Joint 4 (\( \theta_4 \))**:
   - Calculate \( \theta_4 \) to align the end effector with the desired orientation. Since the orientation is not specified in the problem, we assume \( \theta_4 \) is determined by the remaining degrees of freedom.

Let me now implement the solution in the provided function.

### Implementation:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (theta_1)
    theta_1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Adjust target position for Joint 2 and Joint 3 calculations
    d3 = 0.093  # Offset from TCP to Revolute 4
    y_adjusted = y - d3  # Adjust y position for the offset

    # Step 3: Solve for Joints 2 and 3 (theta_2, theta_3)
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of link 3
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 4
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the x-z plane
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)
    theta_2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    phi = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta_3 = phi - beta

    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (theta_4)
    # Assuming the orientation of the end effector is aligned with the z-axis
    theta_4 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta_2

    return theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
