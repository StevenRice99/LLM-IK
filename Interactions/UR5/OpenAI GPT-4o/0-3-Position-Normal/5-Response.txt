To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Define the problem
The manipulator has 4 revolute joints, and the TCP position is influenced by the joint angles. The forward kinematics equations describe the TCP position as a function of the joint angles. To solve the inverse kinematics, we need to invert these equations.

### Step 2: Analyze the manipulator structure
From the details:
- Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
- Revolute 2, 3, and 4 rotate about the Y-axis.
- The TCP position is influenced by the link lengths and joint angles.

### Step 3: Use geometric relationships
The TCP position can be expressed as:
\[
p = p_1 + R_1(p_2 + R_2(p_3 + R_3(p_4 + R_4 \cdot p_{TCP})))
\]
Where:
- \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) are the link positions.
- \( R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4 \) are the rotation matrices for each joint.

### Step 4: Solve for each joint angle
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
   - The first joint rotates about the Z-axis, so \( \theta_1 \) can be determined from the projection of \( p \) onto the XY-plane.

2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**:
   - The second joint rotates about the Y-axis. Using the geometry of the manipulator, \( \theta_2 \) can be calculated based on the position of the TCP relative to the second link.

3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**:
   - The third joint also rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by considering the position of the TCP relative to the third link.

4. **Joint 4 (\( \theta_4 \))**:
   - The fourth joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be calculated based on the final position of the TCP.

### Step 5: Implement the solution
Now, I will implement the inverse kinematics function in Python.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    L_TCP = 0.093 # Offset of the TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using geometric relationships
    # Project the target position onto the plane of the second joint
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the XY-plane
    z_prime = z - L1          # Adjust for the height of the first link

    # Distance from the second joint to the target position
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + z_prime**2)

    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > (L2 + L3 + L_TCP):
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach")

    # Law of cosines to find angles
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)

    cos_theta2 = (L2**2 + d**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * d)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(z_prime, r) - np.arccos(cos_theta2)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta4
    theta4 = 0  # Assuming no additional rotation for simplicity

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
