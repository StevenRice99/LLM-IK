To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))
- Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
- From the existing code for Joint 1, we know:
  \[
  \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(-x, y)
  \]

### Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))
- Joint 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
- From the existing code for Joint 2, we know:
  \[
  \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
  \]

### Step 3: Solve for Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))
- Joint 3 also rotates about the Y-axis.
- From the existing code for Joint 3, we know:
  \[
  \theta_3 = \text{atan2}(x, z)
  \]

### Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (\( \theta_4 \))
- Joint 4 rotates about the Y-axis.
- From the existing code for Joint 4, we know:
  \[
  \theta_4 = \text{atan2}(p_x, p_z)
  \]

### Step 5: Combine the Solutions
Using the above steps, we can now write the Python function to compute the joint angles.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Solve for joint 2
    theta_2 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint 3
    theta_3 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for joint 4
    theta_4 = math.atan2(x, z)  # Adjusted for the TCP position
    
    return theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4
```

This function computes the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.
