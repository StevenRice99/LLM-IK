The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect and fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions and orientations. The primary issue is that the same formula is being used for all joints, which is not appropriate for a 4-DOF manipulator. Additionally, the function does not account for the geometry of the manipulator or the transformations between links.

To address these issues, I will revise the approach to compute the joint angles step by step, taking into account the manipulator's kinematics and the provided feedback.

---

### Revised Approach

1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
   - Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis and determines the orientation of the manipulator in the XY-plane.
   - Use the target position \( p \) to compute \( \theta_1 \) based on the projection of the target onto the XY-plane.

2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**:
   - Joint 2 rotates about the Y-axis and determines the elevation of the manipulator.
   - Use the geometry of the manipulator and the target position to compute \( \theta_2 \).

3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**:
   - Joint 3 also rotates about the Y-axis and contributes to the extension of the manipulator.
   - Use the remaining distance to the target to compute \( \theta_3 \).

4. **Joint 4 (\( \theta_4 \))**:
   - Joint 4 rotates about the Y-axis and adjusts the orientation of the TCP.
   - Use the target orientation \( r \) to compute \( \theta_4 \).

### Updated Code

Here is the updated implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Link lengths (from DETAILS section)
    L1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    L4 = 0.093    # Length of the TCP offset

    # Step 1: Compute theta_1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Compute the wrist center position
    # Subtract the TCP offset to find the wrist center
    wx = x - L4 * math.cos(rz) * math.cos(ry)
    wy = y - L4 * math.sin(rz) * math.cos(ry)
    wz = z - L4 * math.sin(ry)

    # Step 3: Compute theta_2 and theta_3 using geometric relationships
    # Distance from base to wrist center in the XY-plane
    d = math.sqrt(wx**2 + wy**2)
    # Effective length from base to wrist center
    r = math.sqrt(d**2 + (wz - L1)**2)

    # Check if the target is within reach
    if r > (L2 + L3):
        raise ValueError("Target is out of reach")

    # Law of cosines to find angles
    cos_angle_a = (L2**2 + r**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * r)
    angle_a = math.acos(cos_angle_a)

    cos_angle_b = (L2**2 + L3**2 - r**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    angle_b = math.acos(cos_angle_b)

    # Compute theta_2
    theta_2 = math.atan2(wz - L1, d) - angle_a

    # Compute theta_3
    theta_3 = math.pi - angle_b

    # Step 4: Compute theta_4 (orientation adjustment)
    theta_4 = rz - theta_2 - theta_3

    return theta_1, theta_2, theta_3, theta_4
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Theta 1**:
   - Computed using the target position in the XY-plane.

2. **Wrist Center**:
   - The position of the wrist center is calculated by subtracting the TCP offset from the target position.

3. **Theta 2 and Theta 3**:
   - These are computed using the law of cosines and the geometry of the manipulator.

4. **Theta 4**:
   - Adjusts the orientation of the TCP to match the target orientation.

This implementation takes into account the geometry of the manipulator and the transformations between links. It should produce correct joint angles for the given target positions and orientations.
