It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. I will now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function step by step.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**  
   Use the provided `EXISTING 1` solution to calculate the angle for joint 1 based on the target position `p`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**  
   Use the provided `EXISTING 2` solution to calculate the angle for joint 2 based on the target position `p`.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3):**  
   Use the provided `EXISTING 3` solution to calculate the angle for joint 3 based on the target position `p`.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4):**  
   Use the provided `EXISTING 4` solution to calculate the angle for joint 4 based on the target position `p`.

5. **Combine Results:**  
   Return the calculated joint angles as a tuple.

Here is the completed `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-p[0], p[1])  # Using EXISTING 1 logic
    
    # Joint 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])  # Using EXISTING 2 logic
    
    # Joint 3
    theta3 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])  # Using EXISTING 3 logic
    
    # Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(p[0], p[2])  # Using EXISTING 4 logic
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function calculates the joint angles for the 4-DOF manipulator to reach the target position `p` and orientation `r`.
