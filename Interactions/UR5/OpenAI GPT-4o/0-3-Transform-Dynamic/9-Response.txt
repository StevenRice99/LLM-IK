The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect and fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given targets. The primary issue seems to be that the same logic is being applied to all joints, which is not appropriate for a 4-DOF manipulator with different joint configurations and constraints. Additionally, the function does not account for the specific geometry and kinematics of the manipulator.

To address these issues, I will revise the inverse kinematics function step by step, taking into account the manipulator's geometry and the provided feedback.

### Revised Plan for the Inverse Kinematics Function

1. **Understand the Geometry and Kinematics:**
   - The manipulator has 4 revolute joints with specific positions and orientations.
   - The TCP (Tool Center Point) position and orientation are determined by the combined effects of all joints.

2. **Decompose the Problem:**
   - Solve for each joint angle sequentially, starting from the base (joint 1) to the end effector (joint 4).
   - Use the provided link positions and orientations to compute the joint angles.

3. **Incorporate Feedback:**
   - Use the correct joint values from the feedback to guide the logic for solving each joint angle.
   - Ensure that the computed joint angles match the expected values for the given targets.

4. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Use trigonometric relationships and the manipulator's geometry to compute each joint angle.
   - Verify that the computed joint angles produce the correct TCP position and orientation.

### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Joint 1 (theta1):**
   - Aligns the manipulator with the target position in the XY-plane.
   - Computed using `atan2(py, px)`.

2. **Joint 2 (theta2):**
   - Positions the manipulator in the XZ-plane to reach the target height and distance.
   - Computed using the law of cosines and trigonometric relationships.

3. **Joint 3 (theta3):**
   - Positions the end effector along the Z-axis to reach the target depth.
   - Computed using the law of cosines.

4. **Joint 4 (theta4):**
   - Aligns the TCP with the target orientation.
   - Computed as the residual rotation needed to achieve the desired orientation.
