To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Define the problem
The manipulator has 4 revolute joints:
- Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
- Joints 2, 3, and 4 rotate about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by the cumulative transformations of all joints and links. The forward kinematics equations describe the relationship between joint angles and the TCP position.

### Step 2: Analyze the forward kinematics
From the forward kinematics results, the TCP position is:
\[ \text{TCP} = [x_\text{TCP}, y_\text{TCP}, z_\text{TCP}] \]

The transformations are cumulative:
1. Joint 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
2. Joint 2 rotates about the Y-axis and translates along the link.
3. Joint 3 rotates about the Y-axis and translates along the link.
4. Joint 4 rotates about the Y-axis and translates along the link.

### Step 3: Solve for joint angles
We will solve for each joint angle step by step:
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**: This joint determines the rotation about the Z-axis. From the TCP position, we can calculate \( \theta_1 \) using the projection of the TCP onto the XY-plane.
2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**: This joint determines the elevation of the arm. Using the geometry of the manipulator, we can calculate \( \theta_2 \) based on the TCP position and the link lengths.
3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**: This joint adjusts the reach of the arm. Using the remaining distance to the TCP, we can calculate \( \theta_3 \).
4. **Joint 4 (\( \theta_4 \))**: This joint adjusts the orientation of the TCP. Using the desired orientation \( r \), we can calculate \( \theta_4 \).

### Step 4: Implement the solution
We will now implement the inverse kinematics function in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.13585  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    L_tcp = 0.093 # Offset of the TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using geometry
    # Project the TCP position onto the YZ-plane
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - L_tcp  # Distance from base to TCP projection
    h = z - L1                       # Height from base to TCP

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for theta2 and theta3
    D = (d**2 + h**2 - L2**2 - L3**2) / (2 * L2 * L3)
    theta3 = np.arctan2(np.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)  # Elbow angle

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of sines
    phi2 = np.arctan2(h, d)
    phi1 = np.arctan2(L3 * np.sin(theta3), L2 + L3 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = phi2 - phi1

    # Step 3: Solve for theta4 (orientation adjustment)
    theta4 = r_y - (theta2 + theta3)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.
