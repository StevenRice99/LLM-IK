The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values confirm the expected TCP position and orientation. This provides a reference for understanding the relationship between joint angles and the resulting TCP configuration. Based on this, I will refine the inverse kinematics function to ensure it correctly computes the joint angles for the given target position and orientation.

### Observations from Forward Kinematics:
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**: The rotation about the Z-axis aligns the manipulator to the correct azimuthal angle.
2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**: The elevation angle adjusts the arm to the correct height and reach.
3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**: The elbow angle determines the extension of the arm.
4. **Joint 4 (\( \theta_4 \))**: The wrist angle adjusts the orientation of the TCP.

### Refinement Plan:
- Correctly compute the joint angles using the geometric relationships between the links and the target position.
- Ensure the orientation of the TCP is accurately matched by adjusting \( \theta_4 \).

I will now refine the inverse kinematics function.

``` 

This refined function incorporates adjustments for the TCP offset and ensures the joint angles are computed within their valid ranges. It also handles edge cases where the target might be too close or unreachable due to joint constraints.
