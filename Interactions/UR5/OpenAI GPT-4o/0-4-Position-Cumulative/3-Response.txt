To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator, I will break the problem into steps, leveraging the existing solutions for sub-chains and the forward kinematics data. Here's the plan:

1. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5)**: The TCP position is offset along the Y-axis by 0.093 from the position of Revolute 5. This can be used to compute the angle for Joint 5.

2. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4)**: The position of Revolute 4 is offset along the Z-axis by 0.39225 from Revolute 3. Using this, I can compute the angle for Joint 4.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**: The position of Revolute 3 is offset along the Z-axis by 0.425 from Revolute 2. Using this, I can compute the angle for Joint 3.

4. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**: The position of Revolute 2 is offset along the Y-axis by 0.13585 from Revolute 1. Using this, I can compute the angle for Joint 2.

5. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**: The base joint rotates around the Z-axis, and its angle can be computed using the X and Y coordinates of the target position.

I will now proceed to implement the solution.
