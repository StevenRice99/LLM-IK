The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values `[0.160833519343229, -0.531428494859694, -2.009122191808734, 0.5120384425054391, 0]` produce the desired target position `[-0.532841846174484, 0.024131599924451002, 0.0010529103580930001]`. This indicates that the issue lies in the logic of the inverse kinematics function I provided earlier.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results show that the TCP position is correctly calculated when the joint values are accurate.
2. The joint values produced by my earlier inverse kinematics function were incorrect, leading to a failure in reaching the target position.

### Plan to Fix:
I will analyze the forward kinematics results and the correct joint values to refine the inverse kinematics logic. Specifically:
- I will ensure that the offsets and transformations between links are correctly accounted for.
- I will verify the computation of each joint angle step by step, starting from the base (Revolute 1) to the TCP.

Let me refine the inverse kinematics function.

    # Target position
    x, y, z = p
