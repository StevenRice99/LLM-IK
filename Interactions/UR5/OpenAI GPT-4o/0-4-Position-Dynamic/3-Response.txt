To solve the inverse kinematics for the entire 5-DOF manipulator, I will combine the solutions for the sub-chains provided in the "EXISTING" sections. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Joint 1**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 1" to calculate the angle for the first revolute joint based on the target position `p`.

2. **Joints 2 and 3**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 2" to calculate the angles for the second and third revolute joints. This will involve projecting the target position into the plane of these joints.

3. **Joints 4 and 5**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 3" to calculate the angles for the fourth and fifth revolute joints. This will involve determining the orientation of the end-effector relative to the target.

Now, I will implement the complete inverse kinematics function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Transform the target position into the plane of Joints 2 and 3
    # Adjust for the offset of Joint 2
    y2 = y - 0.13585

    # Step 3: Solve for Joints 2 and 3 using EXISTING 2
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta3 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta3))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta3 = -theta3
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Step 4: Transform the target position into the plane of Joints 4 and 5
    # Adjust for the offset of Joint 4
    z4 = z - 0.81725

    # Step 5: Solve for Joints 4 and 5 using EXISTING 3
    theta4 = math.atan2(x, z4)
    theta5 = 0.0  # Assuming no additional rotation for simplicity

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
