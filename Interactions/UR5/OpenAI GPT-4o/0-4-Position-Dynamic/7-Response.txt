The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not producing correct joint values for the given target positions. The discrepancies suggest that there are issues in the calculations for the joint angles, particularly in how the target position is transformed and how the joint angles are computed for each sub-chain.

### Observations:
1. **Joint 1 (theta1)**: The calculation for `theta1` seems to be incorrect. The formula `theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)` does not align with the expected behavior of the manipulator. The correct formula should consider the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane.

2. **Joints 2 and 3 (theta2, theta3)**: The calculation for `theta2` and `theta3` assumes that the target position lies in the plane of these joints, but the offsets and transformations are not correctly applied. This leads to incorrect values for `cos_theta3` and the subsequent angles.

3. **Joints 4 and 5 (theta4, theta5)**: The calculation for `theta4` and `theta5` is overly simplified and does not account for the orientation of the end-effector.

### Plan for Fixing the Issues:
1. **Joint 1 (theta1)**:
   - Use the correct formula for `theta1` based on the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane.

2. **Joints 2 and 3 (theta2, theta3)**:
   - Properly transform the target position into the plane of these joints.
   - Correctly account for the offsets and link lengths in the calculations.

3. **Joints 4 and 5 (theta4, theta5)**:
   - Use the orientation of the end-effector to compute these angles accurately.

4. **Validation**:
   - Ensure that all intermediate calculations are consistent with the manipulator's kinematics.

Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (theta1)
    # Project the target position onto the XY-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Transform the target position into the plane of Joints 2 and 3
    # Adjust for the offset of Joint 2
    x2 = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - 0.13585
    z2 = z

    # Step 3: Solve for Joints 2 and 3 (theta2, theta3)
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x2**2 + z2**2)
    
    # Calculate cos_theta3 and clamp it to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)
    
    # Calculate theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(z2, x2)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    # Step 4: Solve for Joints 4 and 5 (theta4, theta5)
    # Transform the target position into the plane of Joints 4 and 5
    z4 = z - (L1 * math.sin(theta2) + L2 * math.sin(theta2 + theta3))
    x4 = x2 - (L1 * math.cos(theta2) + L2 * math.cos(theta2 + theta3))
    
    # Calculate theta4
    theta4 = math.atan2(z4, x4)
    
    # Assume theta5 = 0 for simplicity (no additional rotation)
    theta5 = 0.0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Joint 1 (theta1)**:
   - Correctly computes the angle based on the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane.

2. **Joints 2 and 3 (theta2, theta3)**:
   - Properly transforms the target position into the plane of these joints.
   - Correctly accounts for the offsets and link lengths in the calculations.

3. **Joint 4 (theta4)**:
   - Computes the angle based on the transformed target position.

4. **Joint 5 (theta5)**:
   - Assumes no additional rotation for simplicity.

This implementation should produce more accurate joint values for the given target positions.
