To solve the inverse kinematics problem, I will now analyze the forward kinematics results and the given manipulator structure. The goal is to determine the joint angles that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Revolute 1 (Joint 1)**:  
   - This joint rotates about the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the XY-plane determines the angle of this joint.  
   - Using the target position \( p \), the angle \( \theta_1 \) can be calculated as:  
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
     \]

2. **Revolute 2, 3, and 4 (Joints 2, 3, and 4)**:  
   - These joints rotate about the Y-axis and contribute to the vertical positioning of the TCP.  
   - The effective length of the arm in the Z-direction and the projection in the XY-plane will be used to calculate these angles.  
   - The positions of the links and the TCP will be used to solve for these angles geometrically.

3. **Revolute 5 (Joint 5)**:  
   - This joint rotates about the Z-axis and adjusts the orientation of the end-effector.  
   - Since the orientation of the TCP is not specified in the problem, we can assume this joint angle to be zero or any arbitrary value.

I will now proceed to implement the inverse kinematics function step by step.

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    # Check if the target is within reach
    if L > (d3 + d4):
        raise ValueError("Target is out of reach")

    # Law of cosines to find angles
    cos_theta3 = (L**2 - d3**2 - d4**2) / (2 * d3 * d4)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)  # Joint 3 angle

    # Angle between link 3 and the line connecting the origin to the target
