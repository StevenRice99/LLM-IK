The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values produce the desired target position and orientation. This provides a clear reference for how the joint angles affect the end-effector's position and orientation.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values match the target position and orientation.
2. The joint values provided ([2.890244013274014, 2.318646124019325, -1.9271824358779122, 2.051844994559235, -0.22507193439430903]) are consistent with the manipulator's configuration and constraints.

### Next Steps:
The inverse kinematics function needs to be refined to correctly compute the joint angles for the given target position and orientation. I will analyze the relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector's position and orientation, and adjust the calculations for each joint angle accordingly.

Let me update the inverse kinematics function to better match the correct joint values.

import math
import numpy as np
