To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator, I will break the problem into steps, solving for each joint angle sequentially. The forward kinematics data provides the positions and orientations of each link, which will help in determining the joint angles.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**: Solve for the rotation about the Z-axis to align the base with the target position.
2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**: Solve for the rotation about the Y-axis to align the second link with the target position.
3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**: Solve for the rotation about the Y-axis to align the third link with the target position.
4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4)**: Solve for the rotation about the Y-axis to align the fourth link with the target position.
5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5)**: Solve for the rotation about the Z-axis to align the fifth link with the target orientation.

I will now proceed to implement the solution for the inverse kinematics method.
