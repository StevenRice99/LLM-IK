The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values produce the desired target position and orientation. This provides a reference for how the joint angles affect the end-effector's position and orientation.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values match the target position and orientation.
2. The joint values provided ([2.890244013274014, 2.318646124019325, -1.9271824358779122, 2.051844994559235, -0.22507193439430903]) are consistent with the manipulator's configuration and constraints.

### Next Steps:
To improve the inverse kinematics solution, I will analyze the relationship between the joint angles and the end-effector's position and orientation. I will refine the calculations for each joint angle to ensure they align with the target. Let me update the inverse kinematics function accordingly.
