To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles that achieve the desired position and orientation of the TCP. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - The robot has 5 revolute joints, each with a specific axis of rotation.
   - The TCP (Tool Center Point) position and orientation are given as inputs.
   - We need to calculate the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5) that achieve the desired TCP position and orientation.

2. **Forward Kinematics Recap**:
   - The forward kinematics results show the positions of each link and the TCP for a given set of joint angles (all set to 0 in the example).
   - This helps us understand the robot's structure and the transformations between links.

3. **Approach for Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Use the given TCP position and orientation to work backward through the robot's kinematic chain.
   - Solve for each joint angle step by step, considering the constraints and geometry of the robot.

4. **Plan**:
   - Start with the TCP position and orientation.
   - Use geometric relationships and trigonometry to calculate each joint angle.
   - Ensure the solution respects the joint limits.

Now, I will proceed to implement the inverse kinematics function.
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.13585  # Offset along Y for Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.425    # Offset along Z for Revolute 3
    d3 = 0.39225  # Offset along Z for Revolute 4
    d4 = 0.093    # Offset along Y for Revolute 5
    d_tcp = 0.09465  # Offset along Z for TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates around the Z-axis, so θ1 is determined by the projection of the target position on the XY-plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(py, px)

    # Step 2: Solve for θ5 (Revolute 5)
    # Revolute 5 aligns the end-effector orientation around the Z-axis
    theta5 = rz  # Directly set to the Z-orientation of the target

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2, θ3, and θ4 using geometric relationships
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    pz_adjusted = pz - d_tcp
    py_adjusted = np.sqrt(px**2 + py**2) - d4  # Projected distance in the YZ-plane

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ3
    L1 = d2
    L2 = d3
    D = (py_adjusted**2 + pz_adjusted**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = np.arccos(D)  # Elbow angle

    # Solve for θ2 using trigonometry
    phi2 = np.arctan2(pz_adjusted, py_adjusted)
    phi1 = np.arctan2(L2 * np.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * np.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = phi2 - phi1

    # Solve for θ4 to align the end-effector orientation
    theta4 = ry - (theta2 + theta3)

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles step by step using trigonometry and geometric relationships. It assumes the target position and orientation are reachable and does not include error handling for unreachable targets.
