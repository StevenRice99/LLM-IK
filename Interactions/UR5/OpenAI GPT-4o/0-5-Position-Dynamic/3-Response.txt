To solve the inverse kinematics for the entire 6-DOF manipulator, I will combine the solutions for the sub-chains provided in the "EXISTING" sections. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Joint 1**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 1" to calculate the angle for the first revolute joint.
2. **Joints 2 to 4**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 2" to calculate the angles for the second, third, and fourth revolute joints.
3. **Joints 5 and 6**: Use the solution from "EXISTING 3" to calculate the angles for the fifth and sixth revolute joints.

I will now integrate these solutions into the `inverse_kinematics` function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Solve for Joints 2 to 4 using EXISTING 2
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta3 = alpha - beta
    theta4 = 0  # Assuming no additional rotation for simplicity

    # Step 3: Solve for Joints 5 and 6 using EXISTING 3
    theta5 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    theta6 = 0.0  # Assuming no additional rotation for simplicity

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
