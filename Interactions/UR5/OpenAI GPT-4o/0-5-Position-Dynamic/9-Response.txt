The error indicates that the value inside the `math.sqrt` function, specifically `r ** 2 - d1 ** 2`, is negative. This happens when the distance `r` in the XZ plane is less than the offset `d1`. This is a geometric constraint issue, and it suggests that the target position is not reachable in the current implementation.

To fix this, I will ensure that the calculation of `r_prime` accounts for this constraint. If `r ** 2 - d1 ** 2` is negative, it means the target is too close to the base of the manipulator, and we need to handle this case appropriately. I will clamp the value of `r_prime` to ensure it is non-negative.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.13585  # Offset along Y for joint 2
    a2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    a3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    d5 = 0.093    # Offset along Y for joint 5
    d6 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z for joint 6
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # Offset along Y for the TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Adjust target position for the TCP offset
    x_tcp = x
    y_tcp = y - tcp_offset
    z_tcp = z

    # Step 3: Solve for Joints 2 and 3 using planar geometry
    r = math.sqrt(x_tcp**2 + z_tcp**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    r_squared = r ** 2 - d1 ** 2
    if r_squared < 0:
        r_squared = 0  # Clamp to zero to avoid math domain error
    r_prime = math.sqrt(r_squared)  # Adjusted distance considering d1
    phi = math.atan2(z_tcp, x_tcp)  # Angle to the target in the XZ plane
    phi_prime = math.atan2(d1, r_prime)  # Angle due to offset d1

    # Law of cosines to find angles in the triangle formed by a2, a3, and r_prime
    cos_theta3 = (r_prime**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)  # Sine of theta3
    theta2 = phi - phi_prime - math.atan2(a3 * sin_theta3, a2 + a3 * cos_theta3)

    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 4
    theta4 = 0  # Placeholder, as orientation is not yet considered

    # Step 5: Solve for Joints 5 and 6
    theta5 = 0  # Placeholder, as orientation is not yet considered
    theta6 = 0  # Placeholder, as orientation is not yet considered

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```

### Key Fix:
1. **Clamping `r_squared`**:
   - If `r_squared = r ** 2 - d1 ** 2` is negative, it is clamped to `0` to avoid a math domain error in `math.sqrt`.
   - This ensures that the calculation of `r_prime` is always valid.

2. **No Other Changes**:
   - The rest of the code remains the same, as the issue was isolated to the calculation of `r_prime`.

### Next Steps:
- Test the revised implementation to ensure that it handles cases where the target position is close to the base of the manipulator.
- If further issues arise, I will refine the implementation to address them.

Let me know if you encounter any additional errors or if the function still fails to reach the target positions!
