To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Understand the Forward Kinematics**: The forward kinematics provided shows the positions and orientations of each link in the manipulator. This helps us understand the relationship between joint angles and the TCP position.

2. **Decompose the Problem**:
   - The manipulator has 6 revolute joints, each contributing to the position and orientation of the TCP.
   - The first three joints primarily determine the position of the TCP, while the last three joints adjust its orientation.

3. **Use Geometric Relationships**:
   - The manipulator's structure and the given link positions/orientations allow us to use trigonometric relationships to compute the joint angles.

4. **Solve for Each Joint Angle**:
   - Start with the base joint (Revolute 1) and work upwards to Revolute 6.
   - Use the target position \( p \) and the manipulator's geometry to compute each joint angle.

5. **Return the Joint Angles**:
   - Ensure the computed angles are within the specified limits.

Now, I will proceed to implement the inverse kinematics function.
```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, solve, sin, cos, atan2, sqrt

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets (from the DETAILS section)
    d1 = 0.13585  # Offset along Z1
    a2 = 0.425    # Length of link 2
    a3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    d4 = 0.093    # Offset along Z4
    d6 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z6
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP offset along Y6

    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    z_eff = z - d6  # Effective z position
    y_eff = sqrt(y**2 + x**2) - tcp_offset  # Effective y position

    # Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = atan2(y, x)

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 (Revolute 2 and 3)
    r = sqrt(y_eff**2 + z_eff**2)  # Distance to the wrist center
    phi = atan2(z_eff, y_eff)  # Angle to the wrist center
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - a2**2 - a3**2) / (2 * a2 * a3)
    theta3 = atan2(sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2), cos_theta3)  # Elbow up solution
    theta2 = phi - atan2(a3 * sin(theta3), a2 + a3 * cos(theta3))

    # Solve for theta4, theta5, and theta6 (Revolute 4, 5, and 6)
    # Assuming the orientation of the TCP is aligned with the Z-axis
    theta4 = 0  # No rotation around Y4
    theta5 = 0  # No rotation around Z5
    theta6 = 0  # No rotation around Y6

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
``` 

This function computes the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \). It uses geometric relationships and trigonometry to solve for each joint angle. Note that this solution assumes the TCP orientation is aligned with the Z-axis, as no specific orientation was provided in the problem statement.
