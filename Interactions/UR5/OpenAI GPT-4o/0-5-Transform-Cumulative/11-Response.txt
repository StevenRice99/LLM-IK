To proceed step by step, I will analyze the problem and use the provided existing solutions to construct the inverse kinematics function. Let me start by solving for the first joint using the provided data.

I will now use **EXISTING 1** to determine the solution for joint 1.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for joint 1 using EXISTING 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Placeholder for other joint calculations
    theta2 = 0
    theta3 = 0
    theta4 = 0
    theta5 = 0
    theta6 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5, theta6)
```
