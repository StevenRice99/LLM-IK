To solve the inverse kinematics for the 6-DOF manipulator, I will now proceed step by step to compute the joint angles required to reach the given position and orientation of the TCP. Let's break this down systematically.

### Step 1: Analyze the TCP Position and Orientation
The target position of the TCP is given as `p = [x, y, z]` and the orientation as `r = [roll, pitch, yaw]`. The TCP position and orientation are influenced by the transformations of all six joints.

### Step 2: Use Existing Solutions
The existing solutions provide analytical methods for solving sub-chains of the manipulator:
1. **Existing Code 1**: Solves for joint 1.
2. **Existing Code 2**: Solves for joint 2.
3. **Existing Code 3**: Solves for joint 3.
4. **Existing Code 4**: Solves for joint 4.
5. **Existing Code 5**: Solves for joints 5 and 6.

These solutions will be used to compute the joint angles step by step.

### Step 3: Compute Joint Angles
1. **Joint 1**: Use the position of the TCP to compute the angle for joint 1.
2. **Joint 2**: Use the position of the TCP relative to joint 1 to compute the angle for joint 2.
3. **Joint 3**: Use the position of the TCP relative to joints 1 and 2 to compute the angle for joint 3.
4. **Joint 4**: Use the position of the TCP relative to joints 1, 2, and 3 to compute the angle for joint 4.
5. **Joints 5 and 6**: Use the orientation of the TCP to compute the angles for joints 5 and 6.

I will now proceed to implement the solution for the `inverse_kinematics` function.
