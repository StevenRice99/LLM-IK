It seems that the forward kinematics results are consistent and provide the positions and orientations of each link and the TCP. Now, I will proceed to derive the inverse kinematics solution based on the given details and the forward kinematics results.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Inverse Kinematics:
1. **Understand the Target**: The target position `p` and orientation `r` are given. The goal is to compute the joint angles (`θ1` to `θ6`) that achieve this target.

2. **Decompose the Problem**:
   - Use the position of the TCP to determine the first three joint angles (`θ1`, `θ2`, `θ3`) by solving for the position of the wrist center.
   - Use the orientation of the TCP to determine the last three joint angles (`θ4`, `θ5`, `θ6`).

3. **Geometric Approach**:
   - Use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters and the given link positions to compute the wrist center.
   - Solve for each joint angle using trigonometric relationships.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Write the Python code to compute the joint angles.

Let me now proceed to implement the inverse kinematics function.
