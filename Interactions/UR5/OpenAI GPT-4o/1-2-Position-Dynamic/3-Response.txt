To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis, affecting the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis as well, but its effect is relative to the position of Revolute 1.

2. **Decompose the Problem**:
   - Use the provided solutions for sub-chains to calculate the angles for each joint.
   - Start with the TCP position and work backward to determine the joint angles.

3. **Use Existing Code**:
   - The existing code for joint 2 calculates the angle \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position.
   - The existing code for joint 5 (not directly relevant here) calculates another angle, but we focus on joint 2 for now.

4. **Calculate Joint 1**:
   - Joint 1's angle \( \theta_1 \) can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and using trigonometry.

5. **Combine Results**:
   - Combine the results for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to form the complete solution.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate joint 2 (theta_2) using the existing solution
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    z_offset = 0.425  # Offset along the Z-axis for Revolute 2
    theta_2 = -math.atan2(-x, z - z_offset)

    # Calculate joint 1 (theta_1)
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Offset along the Y-axis for Revolute 2
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y - y_offset, d)

    return theta_1, theta_2
```

### Explanation:
- **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**:
  - Uses the X and Z coordinates to determine the angle required to align the TCP in the XZ-plane.
  - Accounts for the offset of Revolute 2 along the Z-axis.

- **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
  - Uses the Y coordinate and the distance in the XZ-plane to determine the angle required to align the TCP in the YZ-plane.
  - Accounts for the offset of Revolute 2 along the Y-axis.

This solution ensures that the TCP reaches the target position \( p \) by appropriately setting the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
