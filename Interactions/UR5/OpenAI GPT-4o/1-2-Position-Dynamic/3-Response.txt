To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis and affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.
   - Revolute 2 also rotates about the Y-axis and contributes to the TCP's position along the X and Z axes.

2. **Decompose the Problem**:
   - Use the provided solutions for sub-chains to calculate the angles for each joint.
   - The TCP's position relative to the base frame is influenced by both joints.

3. **Use Existing Solutions**:
   - The first existing solution calculates the angle for joint 2 based on the target position.
   - The second existing solution calculates the angle for joint 5 (not directly relevant here but could be adapted).

4. **Formulate the Solution**:
   - Use trigonometric relationships to calculate θ1 and θ2.
   - Ensure the TCP's position matches the target \( p \).

Now, I will complete the `inverse_kinematics` function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Lengths and offsets from the manipulator's geometry
    d1 = 0.425  # Distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along Z-axis
    d2 = 0.39225  # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis

    # Calculate the effective distance in the XZ plane from the base to the TCP
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)

    # Calculate joint 2 angle (theta2)
    # Using the geometry of the manipulator
    theta2 = -math.atan2(-x_target, z_target)

    # Calculate joint 1 angle (theta1)
    # Using the projection of the TCP in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)

    return theta1, theta2
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \). It uses trigonometric relationships and the geometry of the manipulator to determine the angles.
