The feedback indicates that the solution failed to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issue lies in the incorrect computation of joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \)) and joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \)). The provided joint values from the working inverse kinematics solver suggest that the approach needs to be revised to correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator.

### Observations:
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
   - The current implementation does not compute \( \theta_1 \) correctly. It assumes \( \theta_1 = 0 \), which is incorrect for most target positions.
   - \( \theta_1 \) should be computed based on the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane, considering the offsets and the geometry of the manipulator.

2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**:
   - The current implementation for \( \theta_2 \) is also incorrect. It does not properly account for the offsets and the relative position of the TCP with respect to the second joint.

3. **Offsets**:
   - The offsets along the Y-axis (\(-0.1197\)) and Z-axis (\(0.425\)) are not being handled correctly in the calculations.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Compute \( \theta_1 \) based on the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane.
2. Compute \( \theta_2 \) by considering the relative position of the TCP with respect to the second joint, accounting for the offsets.

### Updated Solution:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Offset values
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Offset along the Y-axis for Revolute 2
    z_offset = 0.425    # Offset along the Z-axis for Revolute 2
    tcp_length = 0.39225  # Length of the TCP along the Z-axis

    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP length
    z_adjusted = z - tcp_length

    # Compute joint 1 (theta_1)
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z_adjusted)

    # Compute joint 2 (theta_2)
    # Relative position of the TCP with respect to the second joint
    x_rel = x
    z_rel = z_adjusted - z_offset
    theta_2 = math.atan2(x_rel, z_rel)

    return theta_1, theta_2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Adjusting for TCP Length**:
   - The TCP has a length of \( 0.39225 \) along the Z-axis. This must be subtracted from the target Z-coordinate to compute the correct joint angles.

2. **Computing \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - \( \theta_1 \) is computed using the arctangent of the X and adjusted Z coordinates. This aligns the manipulator's first joint with the target position in the XZ-plane.

3. **Computing \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - \( \theta_2 \) is computed using the relative position of the TCP with respect to the second joint, accounting for the Z-offset (\( 0.425 \)).

### Next Steps:
This updated solution should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target positions. If further adjustments are needed, additional feedback from testing can help refine the approach.
