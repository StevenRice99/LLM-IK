The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect. The primary issue is that the same angle is being assigned to both joints, which is not valid for this manipulator. The correct solution requires calculating the angles for each joint independently, taking into account the geometry and kinematics of the manipulator.

### Observations from Feedback:
1. The TCP is not reaching the target positions because the joint angles are not being calculated correctly.
2. The correct joint values provided in the feedback show that the two joints have different angles, which is expected for a 2-DOF manipulator.
3. The current implementation does not properly account for the geometry of the manipulator, specifically the offsets and link lengths.

### Plan to Fix the Function:
1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 (θ1) rotates about the Y-axis and affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.
   - Revolute 2 (θ2) also rotates about the Y-axis and contributes to the TCP's position along the X and Z axes.
   - The TCP's position is determined by the combined effects of both joints.

2. **Use Trigonometry**:
   - Use the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) to calculate the angles for each joint.
   - Account for the link lengths and offsets in the calculations.

3. **Iterative Approach**:
   - First, calculate the angle for joint 2 (θ2) using the geometry of the manipulator.
   - Then, calculate the angle for joint 1 (θ1) based on the position of the TCP relative to the base frame.

4. **Update the Function**:
   - Correctly calculate θ1 and θ2 using trigonometric relationships.
   - Ensure the calculations are consistent with the manipulator's geometry.

I will now revise the `inverse_kinematics` function to address these issues.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.425  # Distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along Z-axis
    d2 = 0.39225  # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis

    # Calculate the effective distance in the XZ plane from the base to the TCP
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)

    # Calculate joint 2 angle (theta2)
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # sin(theta2) from Pythagorean identity
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Calculate joint 1 angle (theta1)
    # Using the projection of the TCP in the XZ plane
    phi = math.atan2(z_target, x_target)  # Angle to the target position
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)  # Offset due to joint 2
    theta1 = phi - beta

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Link Lengths and Offsets**:
   - The distances \( d1 \) and \( d2 \) are used to calculate the position of the TCP relative to the base frame.

2. **Effective Distance**:
   - The distance \( r \) is the projection of the TCP in the XZ plane, calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Joint 2 (θ2)**:
   - The law of cosines is used to calculate the angle at joint 2 based on the geometry of the manipulator.
   - The sine of θ2 is calculated using the Pythagorean identity to ensure the correct quadrant is used.

4. **Joint 1 (θ1)**:
   - The angle \( \phi \) is the direction to the target position in the XZ plane.
   - The angle \( \beta \) accounts for the offset caused by joint 2.
   - The final angle for joint 1 is calculated as \( \phi - \beta \).

This revised function should correctly calculate the joint angles for the 2-DOF manipulator.
