The feedback indicates that the TCP is reaching positions that are rotated by 90 degrees around the Y-axis compared to the target positions. This suggests that the coordinate system or the interpretation of the X and Z axes in the calculations is incorrect. Specifically, the X and Z coordinates appear to be swapped in the output positions.

### Observations:
1. The TCP's position is consistently rotated by 90 degrees around the Y-axis.
2. The joint angles for θ1 are incorrect, while θ2 seems to be calculated correctly in most cases.
3. The issue likely lies in the calculation of θ1, where the X and Z coordinates are being misinterpreted.

### Plan to Fix the Function:
1. **Correct the Coordinate System**:
   - Ensure that the X and Z coordinates are interpreted correctly when calculating θ1.
   - The angle θ1 should be calculated based on the correct projection of the TCP in the XZ plane.

2. **Revisit the Calculation of θ1**:
   - Use the correct trigonometric relationships to calculate θ1.
   - Ensure that the angle is calculated in the correct quadrant.

3. **Verify the Calculation of θ2**:
   - Confirm that θ2 is being calculated correctly using the law of cosines.

4. **Update the Function**:
   - Fix the calculation of θ1 to account for the correct coordinate system.
   - Ensure that the function produces the correct joint angles for all test cases.

I will now revise the `inverse_kinematics` function to address these issues.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.425  # Distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along Z-axis
    d2 = 0.39225  # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis

    # Calculate the effective distance in the XZ plane from the base to the TCP
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)

    # Calculate joint 2 angle (theta2)
    # Using the law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # sin(theta2) from Pythagorean identity
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Calculate joint 1 angle (theta1)
    # Using the projection of the TCP in the XZ plane
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)  # Angle to the target position
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)  # Offset due to joint 2
    theta1 = phi - beta

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Corrected the Calculation of θ1**:
   - The angle \( \phi \) is now calculated as \( \text{atan2}(x, z) \), which correctly interprets the X and Z coordinates.
   - The offset \( \beta \) is subtracted from \( \phi \) to calculate θ1.

2. **Verified the Calculation of θ2**:
   - The law of cosines is used to calculate θ2, and the sine of θ2 is calculated using the Pythagorean identity to ensure the correct quadrant.

3. **Coordinate System**:
   - The X and Z coordinates are now interpreted correctly in the calculations.

This revised function should correctly calculate the joint angles for the 2-DOF manipulator.
