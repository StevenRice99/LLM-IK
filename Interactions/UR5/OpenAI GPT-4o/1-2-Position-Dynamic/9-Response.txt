The feedback indicates that the solution is still failing to compute the correct joint angles. The primary issues seem to be:
1. **Incorrect handling of the geometry of the manipulator**: The offsets and the relative positions of the joints are not being properly accounted for.
2. **Incorrect computation of joint angles**: The computed joint angles are far from the correct values, leading to significant errors in the TCP position.

### Observations:
1. The manipulator has two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis. This means the X and Z coordinates of the TCP are affected by both joints.
2. The offsets along the Y-axis (\(-0.1197\)) and Z-axis (\(0.425\)) are critical to the computation of the joint angles.
3. The TCP length (\(0.39225\)) must also be properly accounted for in the calculations.

### Revised Approach:
To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Properly compute the relative position of the TCP with respect to each joint, accounting for all offsets.
2. Use trigonometric relationships to compute the joint angles based on the relative positions.

### Updated Solution:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Offset values
    y_offset = -0.1197  # Offset along the Y-axis for Revolute 2
    z_offset = 0.425    # Offset along the Z-axis for Revolute 2
    tcp_length = 0.39225  # Length of the TCP along the Z-axis

    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP length
    z_adjusted = z - tcp_length

    # Compute joint 2 (theta_2)
    # Relative position of the TCP with respect to the second joint
    x_rel = x
    z_rel = z_adjusted - z_offset
    theta_2 = math.atan2(x_rel, z_rel)

    # Compute joint 1 (theta_1)
    # Relative position of the TCP with respect to the first joint
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z_adjusted**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y - y_offset, d)

    return theta_1, theta_2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Adjusting for TCP Length**:
   - The TCP has a length of \( 0.39225 \) along the Z-axis. This must be subtracted from the target Z-coordinate to compute the correct joint angles.

2. **Computing \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - \( \theta_2 \) is computed using the relative position of the TCP with respect to the second joint, accounting for the Z-offset (\( 0.425 \)).

3. **Computing \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - \( \theta_1 \) is computed using the relative position of the TCP with respect to the first joint, accounting for the Y-offset (\(-0.1197\)).

### Next Steps:
This updated solution should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target positions. If further adjustments are needed, additional feedback from testing can help refine the approach.
