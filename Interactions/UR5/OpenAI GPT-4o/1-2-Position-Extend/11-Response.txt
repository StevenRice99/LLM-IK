The feedback indicates that the computed positions are consistently incorrect, with the X and Z coordinates swapped or mirrored. This suggests that the calculation of the first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is fundamentally flawed. The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) appears to have the correct magnitude but the wrong sign in some cases.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Swapped X and Z Coordinates:**
   - The computed positions indicate that the X and Z coordinates are being swapped or mirrored. This suggests that the calculation of \( \phi \) (the angle of the target position in the XZ-plane) is incorrect or not being used properly.

2. **Incorrect Quadrant Handling:**
   - The feedback shows that the computed \( \theta_1 \) values are often in the wrong quadrant. This indicates that the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) does not correctly account for the quadrant of the target position.

3. **Sign of \( \theta_2 \):**
   - The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) appears to have the correct magnitude but the wrong sign in some cases. This suggests that the calculation of \( \theta_2 \) does not correctly account for the manipulator's configuration.

### Plan to Fix the Issue
1. **Revisit the Calculation of \( \phi \):**
   - Ensure that \( \phi \) correctly represents the angle of the target position in the XZ-plane relative to the base.
   - Use \( \math.atan2(z_{\text{target}}, x_{\text{target}}) \) to compute \( \phi \), as this function accounts for the correct quadrant of the target position.

2. **Adjust the Calculation of \( \theta_1 \):**
   - Correctly combine \( \phi \) with the angle contribution from the second joint to compute \( \theta_1 \).
   - Ensure that \( \theta_1 \) is in the correct quadrant.

3. **Verify the Sign of \( \theta_2 \):**
   - Ensure that the sign of \( \theta_2 \) is consistent with the manipulator's configuration.

### Updated Solution
Here is the corrected implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Distance from the base to the target in the XZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using trigonometry
    phi = math.atan2(z_target, x_target)  # Correctly compute the angle in the XZ-plane
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # sin(theta2) from Pythagorean identity
    k1 = l1 + l2 * cos_theta2
    k2 = l2 * sin_theta2
    theta1 = phi - math.atan2(k2, k1)

    # Adjust theta1 to account for the correct quadrant
    if x_target < 0:
        theta1 += math.pi

    # Ensure theta2 has the correct sign
    if z_target < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Key Changes
1. **Corrected the Calculation of \( \phi \):**
   - Used \( \math.atan2(z_{\text{target}}, x_{\text{target}}) \) to compute the angle of the target position in the XZ-plane.

2. **Adjusted the Calculation of \( \theta_1 \):**
   - Added a conditional adjustment to \( \theta_1 \) to ensure it accounts for the correct quadrant of the target position.

3. **Verified the Sign of \( \theta_2 \):**
   - Added a conditional adjustment to \( \theta_2 \) to ensure it has the correct sign based on the manipulator's configuration.

### Next Steps
Please test the updated solution on the provided test cases to verify that it correctly computes the joint angles for all target positions. If any issues persist, additional debugging may be required to refine the calculations further.
