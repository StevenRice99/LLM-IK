The feedback indicates that the computed positions are consistently mirrored or rotated incorrectly in the XZ-plane. This suggests that the issue lies in the calculation of the first joint angle \( \theta_1 \), which determines the orientation of the manipulator in the XZ-plane. The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) appears to be correct in magnitude but may have the wrong sign in some cases.

### Root Cause
The primary issue is that the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) does not correctly account for the orientation of the target position in the XZ-plane. Specifically:
1. The computed \( \phi \) (the angle of the target position in the XZ-plane) is not being used correctly to determine \( \theta_1 \).
2. The signs of the angles are not being handled correctly, leading to mirrored or rotated positions.

### Plan to Fix the Issue
1. **Revisit the Calculation of \( \phi \):**
   - Ensure that \( \phi \) correctly represents the angle of the target position in the XZ-plane relative to the base.
   - Use \( \math.atan2(z_{\text{target}}, x_{\text{target}}) \) to compute \( \phi \), as this function accounts for the correct quadrant of the target position.

2. **Adjust the Calculation of \( \theta_1 \):**
   - Correctly combine \( \phi \) with the angle contribution from the second joint to compute \( \theta_1 \).

3. **Verify the Sign of \( \theta_2 \):**
   - Ensure that the sign of \( \theta_2 \) is consistent with the manipulator's configuration.

### Updated Solution
Here is the corrected implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Distance from the base to the target in the XZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using trigonometry
    phi = math.atan2(z_target, x_target)  # Correctly compute the angle in the XZ-plane
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # sin(theta2) from Pythagorean identity
    k1 = l1 + l2 * cos_theta2
    k2 = l2 * sin_theta2
    theta1 = phi - math.atan2(k2, k1)

    # Adjust theta1 to account for the correct quadrant
    if x_target < 0:
        theta1 += math.pi

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Key Changes
1. **Corrected the Calculation of \( \phi \):**
   - Used \( \math.atan2(z_{\text{target}}, x_{\text{target}}) \) to compute the angle of the target position in the XZ-plane.

2. **Adjusted the Calculation of \( \theta_1 \):**
   - Added a conditional adjustment to \( \theta_1 \) to ensure it accounts for the correct quadrant of the target position.

3. **Verified the Sign of \( \theta_2 \):**
   - Ensured that \( \theta_2 \) is computed using \( \math.acos \), which always returns a positive angle. The sign of \( \theta_2 \) is determined by the manipulator's configuration.

### Next Steps
Please test the updated solution on the provided test cases to verify that it correctly computes the joint angles for all target positions. If any issues persist, additional debugging may be required to refine the calculations further.
