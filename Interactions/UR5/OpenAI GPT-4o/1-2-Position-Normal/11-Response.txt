The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics solution is still incorrect. The primary issue seems to be that the computed joint angles are not correctly positioning the TCP in the desired orientation. Specifically, the positions reached by the code are rotated versions of the target positions, suggesting that the coordinate system or the trigonometric relationships are not being handled correctly.

### Observations:
1. The TCP positions reached by the code are rotated versions of the target positions, particularly in the XZ plane.
2. The joint angles computed by the code are often in the wrong quadrant or have incorrect signs, leading to incorrect orientations.
3. The feedback provides the correct joint values, which can be used to verify the forward kinematics and debug the inverse kinematics solution.

### Root Cause:
The issue lies in the incorrect handling of the coordinate system and the trigonometric relationships. Specifically:
1. The manipulator operates in the XZ plane, but the calculations are not correctly accounting for the rotation about the Y-axis.
2. The angles are not being computed in the correct quadrants, leading to incorrect orientations.

### Plan to Fix the Issue:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - Carefully analyze the kinematic chain and ensure that the relationships between the joint angles and the TCP position are correctly modeled.
   - Ensure that the offsets and rotations are properly accounted for.

2. **Correct the Trigonometric Calculations**:
   - Use the correct coordinate system (XZ plane) and ensure that the angles are computed in the correct quadrants using `atan2`.

3. **Test the Solution**:
   - Use the provided correct joint values to verify the forward kinematics and ensure that the inverse kinematics solution aligns with the expected results.

Let me now proceed to revise the inverse kinematics function.

### Revised Code:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from Joint 1 to Joint 2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from Joint 2 to TCP

    # Adjust for the offset in the Y-direction
    y -= -0.1197

    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using trigonometry
    phi = math.atan2(z, x)  # Angle to the target in the XZ plane
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))  # Angle of the second link
    theta1 = phi - psi

    # Adjust theta1 to account for the rotation about the Y-axis
    theta1 = -theta1

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Corrected the Geometry**:
   - The distance `r` is computed in the XZ plane, as the manipulator operates in this plane.
   - The angle `phi` is computed using `atan2(z, x)` to correctly account for the target position in the XZ plane.

2. **Adjusted the Trigonometric Calculations**:
   - The angle `theta1` is adjusted to account for the rotation about the Y-axis by negating it.

3. **Clamped `cos_theta2`**:
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to ensure numerical stability.

### Next Steps:
1. Test the revised code with the provided test cases to verify that it produces the correct joint angles.
2. If the solution still fails, analyze the forward kinematics to ensure that the computed joint angles produce the expected TCP positions.

Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
