To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Analyze the Kinematic Chain
1. **Revolute Joint 1**:
   - Positioned at the origin \([0, 0, 0]\).
   - Rotates about the Y-axis.

2. **Revolute Joint 2**:
   - Positioned at \([0, -0.1197, 0.425]\) relative to Joint 1.
   - Rotates about the Y-axis.

3. **TCP**:
   - Positioned at \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) relative to Joint 2.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics equations describe the position of the TCP as a function of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). Using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) convention or geometric analysis, we can derive the position of the TCP.

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
To solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we use the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). The equations are derived from the geometry of the manipulator.

Let me now proceed to complete the Python function for the inverse kinematics solution.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from Joint 1 to Joint 2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from Joint 2 to TCP

    # Adjust for the offset in the Y-direction
    y -= -0.1197

    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the YZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(y**2 + z**2)

    # Check if the target is reachable (assumed to be always reachable as per instructions)
    if r > (l1 + l2):
        raise ValueError("Target is out of reach")

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using trigonometry
    phi = math.atan2(z, y)  # Angle to the target in the YZ plane
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))  # Angle of the second link
    theta1 = phi - psi

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \). The solution uses trigonometry and the law of cosines to solve for the angles.
