To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Define the manipulator geometry
From the details provided:
- Revolute 1 is at the base, with its axis of rotation along the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 is offset by \([0, -0.1197, 0.425]\) from Revolute 1, with its axis of rotation also along the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset by \([0, 0, 0.39225]\) from Revolute 2.

### Step 2: Forward kinematics equations
The forward kinematics can be expressed as:
1. Revolute 1 rotates around the Y-axis by \( \theta_1 \).
2. Revolute 2 rotates around the Y-axis by \( \theta_2 \).
3. The TCP position is calculated by summing the transformations.

### Step 3: Inverse kinematics
To find \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we need to solve the equations derived from the forward kinematics. Let me now proceed to compute the inverse kinematics.

I will now complete the Python function.
Here is the completed Python function for the inverse kinematics:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.425  # Distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along Z-axis
    d2 = 0.39225  # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis
    offset_y = -0.1197  # Offset along Y-axis between Revolute 1 and Revolute 2

    # Adjust target position to account for the offset along Y-axis
    y_adjusted = y - offset_y

    # Compute the effective distance in the Z direction
    z_eff = z - d2

    # Compute the angle for joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    r = math.sqrt(y_adjusted**2 + z_eff**2)  # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Positive root for reachable solutions
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Compute the angle for joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    phi = math.atan2(z_eff, y_adjusted)
    psi = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - psi

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Adjusting for the offset**: The Y-offset between Revolute 1 and Revolute 2 is subtracted from the target Y-coordinate.
2. **Effective Z-distance**: The Z-offset of the TCP is subtracted from the target Z-coordinate to compute the effective distance.
3. **Joint 2 angle (\( \theta_2 \))**: Using the law of cosines, the angle is computed based on the geometry of the manipulator.
4. **Joint 1 angle (\( \theta_1 \))**: Using trigonometry, the angle is computed by considering the effective position of the TCP relative to Revolute 1.

This function assumes all target positions are reachable and returns the joint angles in radians.
