To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Analyze the Kinematic Chain
The manipulator consists of two revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1**: Rotates about the Y-axis at the base.
2. **Revolute 2**: Rotates about the Y-axis, offset by the position of the first link.

The TCP position is determined by the combined rotations of these two joints and the link lengths.

### Step 2: Define the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position can be expressed as:
\[
x_{TCP} = 0 \quad \text{(no X-axis displacement due to Y-axis rotation)}
\]
\[
y_{TCP} = L_1 \sin(\theta_1) + L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
z_{TCP} = L_1 \cos(\theta_1) + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
Where:
- \( L_1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
- \( L_2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)
Given the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \), we solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) as follows:
1. Compute the projection of the target position onto the YZ-plane:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{y^2 + z^2}
   \]
2. Use the law of cosines to solve for \( \theta_2 \):
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta_2) = \pm\sqrt{1 - \cos^2(\theta_2)}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(\sin(\theta_2), \cos(\theta_2))
   \]
3. Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the law of sines:
   \[
   \phi = \text{atan2}(z, y)
   \]
   \[
   \psi = \text{atan2}(L_2 \sin(\theta_2), L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2))
   \]
   \[
   \theta_1 = \phi - \psi
   \]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution in Python
Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Compute the distance to the target in the YZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Assume the positive solution
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    phi = math.atan2(z, y)
    psi = math.atan2(L2 * sin_theta2, L1 + L2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the given target position \( p \).
