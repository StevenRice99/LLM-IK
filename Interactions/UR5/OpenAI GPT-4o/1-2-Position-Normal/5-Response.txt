To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Define the Kinematic Chain
The manipulator consists of:
1. **Revolute Joint 1**: Rotates about the Y-axis at the base.
2. **Revolute Joint 2**: Rotates about the Y-axis, offset by the link's position.

The TCP is located at a fixed offset from the second joint.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics equations describe the position of the TCP as a function of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). Using the given link positions and orientations:
- The first joint rotates about the Y-axis, affecting the position of the second joint.
- The second joint rotates about the Y-axis, affecting the position of the TCP.

The TCP position can be expressed as:
\[
\text{TCP}_x = 0 \quad \text{(no X-axis movement due to Y-axis rotation)}
\]
\[
\text{TCP}_y = -0.1197 \cos(\theta_1) - 0.39225 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
\text{TCP}_z = 0.425 + 0.1197 \sin(\theta_1) + 0.39225 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
Given a target position \( p = (x, y, z) \), we solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \):
1. From the geometry, the manipulator operates in the YZ-plane. Thus, \( x \) must always be 0.
2. Use the target \( y \) and \( z \) to solve for the joint angles.

#### Step 3.1: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The distance from the base to the TCP in the YZ-plane is:
\[
r = \sqrt{y^2 + (z - 0.425)^2}
\]
Using the law of cosines:
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
\]
where \( L_1 = 0.1197 \) and \( L_2 = 0.39225 \).

#### Step 3.2: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
Using the geometry of the manipulator:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(z - 0.425, y) - \arcsin\left(\frac{L_2 \sin(\theta_2)}{r}\right)
\]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
Now, I will implement the above equations in the provided Python function.

```python
import math

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.1197
    L2 = 0.39225
    z_offset = 0.425  # Base height offset
    
    # Ensure the target is in the YZ-plane
    if x != 0:
        raise ValueError("Target position must lie in the YZ-plane (x = 0).")
    
    # Distance from base to target in the YZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(y**2 + (z - z_offset)**2)
    
    # Solve for theta_2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    phi = math.atan2(z - z_offset, y)
    psi = math.asin((L2 * math.sin(theta2)) / r)
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return theta1, theta2
