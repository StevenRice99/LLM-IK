The error indicates that the function is raising a `ValueError` because the target position does not lie in the YZ-plane (i.e., \( x \neq 0 \)). However, the problem statement does not explicitly state that the target position will always have \( x = 0 \). This suggests that the manipulator might be capable of handling positions with non-zero \( x \), and the function should not enforce this restriction.

To address this, I will modify the function to handle cases where \( x \neq 0 \). Specifically:
1. I will compute the projection of the target position onto the YZ-plane.
2. I will solve the inverse kinematics in the YZ-plane as before.
3. I will ensure the solution accounts for the \( x \)-coordinate by considering the manipulator's geometry.

Here is the updated function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.1197
    L2 = 0.39225
    z_offset = 0.425  # Base height offset
    
    # Compute the effective distance in the YZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + (z - z_offset)**2)
    
    # Solve for theta_2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    phi = math.atan2(z - z_offset, math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2))
    psi = math.asin((L2 * math.sin(theta2)) / r)
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the restriction that \( x = 0 \).
2. Updated the computation of \( r \) to include the \( x \)-coordinate.
3. Adjusted the calculation of \( \phi \) to account for the projection of the target position onto the YZ-plane.

This updated function should now handle cases where \( x \neq 0 \) without raising an error. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
