The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function, which is \([-1, 1]\). This happens because of numerical inaccuracies or invalid inputs to the law of cosines formula. To fix this, we need to ensure that `cos_theta2` is clamped to the valid range before computing `sin_theta2`.

### Updated Solution
We will modify the code to clamp `cos_theta2` to the range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid the math domain error.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    
    # Compute the distance to the target in the YZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Assume the positive solution
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta1
    phi = math.atan2(z, y)
    psi = math.atan2(L2 * sin_theta2, L1 + L2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - psi
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of the Fix
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`:**  
   The value of `cos_theta2` is computed using the law of cosines:
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2}
   \]
   Due to numerical inaccuracies or edge cases, the result might slightly exceed the valid range \([-1, 1]\). By clamping it to this range using:
   ```python
   cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
   ```
   we ensure that the value is always valid for computing `sin_theta2`.

2. **Avoiding `math.sqrt` Errors:**  
   The `math.sqrt` function raises a `ValueError` if the input is negative. By clamping `cos_theta2`, we ensure that \(1 - \cos^2(\theta_2)\) is always non-negative, preventing this error.

### Testing
This updated code should now handle all valid inputs without encountering the `math domain error`. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
