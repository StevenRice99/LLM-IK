The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics solution is not correctly computing the joint angles, leading to incorrect positions for the TCP. The primary issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the geometry and trigonometric relationships in the kinematic chain. Specifically, the computed joint angles do not align with the expected positions.

### Observations from the Feedback:
1. The TCP positions reached by the code are incorrect, and the errors suggest that the computed joint angles are not properly solving the inverse kinematics problem.
2. The correct joint values provided in the feedback differ significantly from the computed joint values, indicating a fundamental issue in the calculations.
3. The positions reached by the code often have the correct magnitude but incorrect signs or orientations, suggesting an issue with the trigonometric calculations or coordinate transformations.

### Plan to Fix the Issue:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - Carefully analyze the kinematic chain and ensure that the relationships between the joint angles and the TCP position are correctly modeled.
   - Ensure that the offsets and rotations are properly accounted for.

2. **Correct the Trigonometric Calculations**:
   - Verify the use of `atan2` and ensure that the angles are computed in the correct quadrants.
   - Ensure that the angles are correctly combined to account for the relative rotations of the joints.

3. **Test the Solution**:
   - Use the provided correct joint values to verify the forward kinematics and ensure that the inverse kinematics solution aligns with the expected results.

Let me now proceed to revise the inverse kinematics function.

### Revised Code:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length from Joint 1 to Joint 2
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length from Joint 2 to TCP

    # Adjust for the offset in the Y-direction
    y -= -0.1197

    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the YZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using trigonometry
    phi = math.atan2(z, x)  # Angle to the target in the XZ plane
    psi = math.atan2(l2 * math.sin(theta2), l1 + l2 * math.cos(theta2))  # Angle of the second link
    theta1 = phi - psi

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Corrected the Geometry**:
   - The distance `r` is now computed in the XZ plane instead of the YZ plane, as the manipulator operates in the XZ plane.

2. **Adjusted the Trigonometric Calculations**:
   - The angle `phi` is computed using `atan2(z, x)` to correctly account for the target position in the XZ plane.
   - The angle `psi` is computed relative to the second link, ensuring that the joint angles are correctly combined.

3. **Clamped `cos_theta2`**:
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to ensure numerical stability.

### Next Steps:
1. Test the revised code with the provided test cases to verify that it produces the correct joint angles.
2. If the solution still fails, analyze the forward kinematics to ensure that the computed joint angles produce the expected TCP positions.

Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
