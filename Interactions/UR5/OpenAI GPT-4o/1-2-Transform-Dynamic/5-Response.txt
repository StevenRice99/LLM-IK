To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired position \( p = (x, y, z) \) and orientation \( r = (rx, ry, rz) \). Since the orientation of all links and the TCP is fixed at [0, 0, 0], we only need to solve for the position.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - The manipulator consists of two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP position is influenced by the lengths of the links and the joint angles.

2. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - The TCP position can be expressed in terms of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using trigonometric relationships.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Using the desired TCP position \( p = (x, y, z) \), we solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Derivation:
The TCP position in the global frame is given by:
\[
x_{TCP} = L_2 \sin(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
\]
\[
y_{TCP} = L_1 + L_2 \sin(\theta_2)
\]
\[
z_{TCP} = L_2 \cos(\theta_1) \cos(\theta_2)
\]
Where:
- \( L_1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
- \( L_2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)

From the above equations, we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Implementation:
We will now complete the `inverse_kinematics` function to compute the joint angles.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Solve for theta2 using the Y-coordinate
    d = y - L1
    theta2 = math.asin(d / L2)

    # Solve for theta1 using X and Z coordinates
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Radial distance in the XZ plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    return theta1, theta2
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the desired TCP position \( p \).
