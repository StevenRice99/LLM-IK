To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis and affects the X-Z plane.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis and affects the position of the TCP along the manipulator's arm.

2. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - Use the provided sub-solutions for the sub-links to calculate the angles for each joint.
   - The TCP position is given as \( [0, -0.1197, 0.81725] \) in the forward kinematics. This means the manipulator's arm extends along the Z-axis and the Y-offset is constant.

3. **Use Existing Code**:
   - The first existing code calculates the angle for Revolute 2 based on the target position.
   - The second existing code calculates the angle for Revolute 1 based on the target position.

4. **Combine the Solutions**:
   - Use the geometry of the manipulator to calculate the angles for both joints.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Calculate joint 2 angle (Revolute 2)
    # Using the first existing code
    theta2 = -math.atan2(-x_target, z_target)

    # Calculate joint 1 angle (Revolute 1)
    # Using the second existing code
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
- **Theta 2**: The angle for Revolute 2 is calculated using the first existing code, which determines the angle based on the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
- **Theta 1**: The angle for Revolute 1 is calculated using the second existing code, which determines the angle based on the X and Z coordinates of the target position.

This solution assumes that the manipulator's geometry and the target position are consistent with the forward kinematics provided.
