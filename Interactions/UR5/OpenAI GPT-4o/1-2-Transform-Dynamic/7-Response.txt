The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect. The primary issue is that the same angle is being assigned to both joints, which is not valid for this manipulator. The correct joint values for each test case differ significantly, indicating that the solution must account for the specific geometry and constraints of the manipulator.

### Analysis of the Problem
1. **Manipulator Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 and Revolute 2 both rotate about the Y-axis, but their effects on the TCP position are distinct.
   - The TCP position is influenced by the combined rotations of both joints.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - The solution must compute the angles for both joints independently, considering the manipulator's kinematics.
   - The provided forward kinematics data and the correct joint values can be used to deduce the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP position.

3. **Plan**:
   - Use the geometry of the manipulator to derive the equations for the joint angles.
   - Solve for the joint angles using the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Updated Solution
The manipulator's geometry suggests that the TCP position can be expressed as a function of the joint angles:
- \( x = L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + L_1 \sin(\theta_1) \)
- \( z = L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) + L_1 \cos(\theta_1) \)
Where:
- \( L_1 = 0.425 \) (length of the first link)
- \( L_2 = 0.39225 \) (length of the second link)

From these equations, we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Implementation
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225

    # Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)

    # Check if the target is reachable
    if d > (L1 + L2):
        raise ValueError("Target is out of reach")

    # Calculate theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Assume the positive solution
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Calculate theta1 using the law of sines and cosines
    alpha = math.atan2(z_target, x_target)  # Angle to the target position
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * sin_theta2, L1 + L2 * cos_theta2)  # Angle of the second link
    theta1 = alpha - beta

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation
1. **Law of Cosines**:
   - Used to calculate \( \theta_2 \) based on the distance \( d \) to the target position.
   - \( \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 L_1 L_2} \).

2. **Law of Sines and Geometry**:
   - Used to calculate \( \theta_1 \) by considering the angles formed by the links and the target position.

3. **Assumptions**:
   - The target position is reachable (as stated in the problem).
   - The positive solution for \( \sin(\theta_2) \) is used.

This updated solution should correctly compute the joint angles for the given target positions.
