To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired position \( p \) and orientation \( r \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Problem
- The manipulator has two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis.
- The TCP position is influenced by the two joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
- The orientation of the TCP is not affected by the joint angles since all orientations are zero in this case.

### Step 2: Define the Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics of the manipulator can be expressed as:
1. Revolute 1 contributes a rotation about the Y-axis and does not translate the TCP.
2. Revolute 2 contributes a rotation about the Y-axis and translates the TCP along the Z-axis.

The TCP position in the global frame is:
\[
\text{TCP}_x = 0
\]
\[
\text{TCP}_y = -0.1197
\]
\[
\text{TCP}_z = 0.425 + 0.39225 = 0.81725
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)
Using the geometry of the manipulator:
1. The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and using the arctangent function.
2. The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) can be determined by considering the relative position of the TCP with respect to the second link.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
We will now complete the Python function to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link
    
    # Compute the distance from the base to the target in the YZ-plane
    d = math.sqrt(y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the law of sines and geometry
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # sin(theta2) from Pythagorean identity
    k1 = l1 + l2 * cos_theta2
    k2 = l2 * sin_theta2
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, z) - math.atan2(k2, k1)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Input Parsing**: The target position \( p \) is extracted into \( x, y, z \).
2. **Link Lengths**: The lengths of the links are defined as \( l1 \) and \( l2 \).
3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance \( d \) from the base to the target in the YZ-plane is computed.
4. **Theta2 Calculation**: Using the law of cosines, \( \cos(\theta_2) \) is calculated, and \( \theta_2 \) is derived using the arccosine function.
5. **Theta1 Calculation**: Using the law of sines and geometry, \( \theta_1 \) is calculated by considering the relative position of the TCP.

This solution assumes that the target position is reachable and does not handle edge cases like singularities or unreachable positions, as per the instructions.
