The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the valid range for the `math.acos` function, which is \([-1, 1]\). This typically happens due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the formula for `cos_theta2`.

Let's revisit the calculation of `cos_theta2` and ensure it is correctly constrained within the valid range.

### Debugging the Issue
The formula for `cos_theta2` is:
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 \cdot l_1 \cdot l_2}
\]
Where:
- \( d \) is the distance from the base to the target in the YZ-plane.
- \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the lengths of the first and second links.

If \( d^2 \) is too large or too small, the numerator of the formula may exceed the denominator, causing `cos_theta2` to fall outside the range \([-1, 1]\). This can happen due to:
1. Numerical precision issues.
2. Incorrect computation of \( d \).

### Fixing the Issue
To address this, we will:
1. Clamp `cos_theta2` to the range \([-1, 1]\) to ensure it is always valid for `math.acos`.
2. Double-check the calculation of \( d \) to ensure it is correct.

### Updated Code
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link
    
    # Compute the distance from the base to the target in the YZ-plane
    d = math.sqrt(y**2 + z**2)
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Solve for theta1 using the law of sines and geometry
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # sin(theta2) from Pythagorean identity
    k1 = l1 + l2 * cos_theta2
    k2 = l2 * sin_theta2
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, z) - math.atan2(k2, k1)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`**:
   - The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))
     ```
   - This ensures that even if numerical inaccuracies cause `cos_theta2` to slightly exceed the valid range, it will be corrected.

2. **Validation of Distance Calculation**:
   - The distance \( d \) is computed as:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{y^2 + z^2}
     \]
   - This ensures that the distance is always positive and correctly represents the distance in the YZ-plane.

### Why This Fix Works
By clamping `cos_theta2`, we ensure that the input to `math.acos` is always valid. This prevents the `ValueError` and allows the function to compute the joint angles correctly.
