The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics solution is failing to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions and orientations. The primary issue seems to be that the computed joint angles do not correctly position the TCP at the desired target. This suggests that there is a fundamental issue in the geometric calculations or assumptions made in the code.

### Observations from the Feedback
1. **Incorrect Joint Angles**: The joint angles computed by the code are significantly different from the correct joint angles provided in the feedback.
2. **Incorrect TCP Position**: The TCP position reached by the computed joint angles is incorrect, often deviating significantly in the X-axis.
3. **Orientation Not Considered**: The orientation of the TCP is not being correctly handled, as the feedback shows mismatches in the Y-axis orientation.

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issues likely stem from:
1. **Incorrect Handling of the X-Axis**: The manipulator's geometry and the target position in the X-axis are not being correctly accounted for in the calculations.
2. **Orientation Not Integrated**: The orientation of the TCP is not being incorporated into the inverse kinematics calculations, leading to mismatches in the Y-axis orientation.
3. **Incorrect Assumptions in Geometry**: The assumptions made in the geometric calculations (e.g., the use of the YZ-plane) may not fully capture the manipulator's kinematics.

### Plan to Fix the Issues
To address these issues, we need to:
1. **Incorporate the X-Axis**: Update the calculations to account for the X-axis position of the TCP.
2. **Integrate Orientation**: Include the orientation of the TCP in the inverse kinematics calculations.
3. **Revisit the Geometry**: Reevaluate the geometric relationships used to compute the joint angles, ensuring they correctly model the manipulator's kinematics.

### Updated Approach
1. **Recompute \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - \( \theta_1 \) determines the rotation of the first joint about the Y-axis.
   - Use the X and Z coordinates of the target position to compute \( \theta_1 \) using the arctangent function.

2. **Recompute \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - \( \theta_2 \) determines the rotation of the second joint about the Y-axis.
   - Use the relative position of the TCP with respect to the second link and the law of cosines to compute \( \theta_2 \).

3. **Account for Orientation**:
   - Use the target orientation to adjust the computed joint angles, ensuring the TCP matches the desired orientation.

### Updated Code
Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    _, ry, _ = r  # Only the Y-axis orientation is relevant for this manipulator
    
    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link
    
    # Step 1: Compute theta1
    # theta1 is the angle of the first joint about the Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Step 2: Compute the effective position of the TCP in the first joint's frame
    # Rotate the target position into the first joint's frame
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    z_prime = y  # Y-coordinate remains the same in the rotated frame
    
    # Step 3: Compute theta2
    # Use the law of cosines to compute theta2
    d = math.sqrt(x_prime**2 + z_prime**2)  # Distance from the first joint to the TCP
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    
    # Adjust theta2 based on the target orientation
    theta2 = theta2 - ry  # Subtract the Y-axis orientation from theta2
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Incorporating the X-Axis**:
   - The X and Z coordinates of the target position are used to compute \( \theta_1 \), ensuring the manipulator correctly aligns with the target in the XZ-plane.

2. **Recomputing \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - The effective position of the TCP in the first joint's frame is computed by rotating the target position into the first joint's frame.
   - The law of cosines is used to compute \( \theta_2 \), ensuring the manipulator correctly positions the TCP at the target.

3. **Adjusting for Orientation**:
   - The target orientation about the Y-axis (\( r_y \)) is subtracted from \( \theta_2 \), ensuring the TCP matches the desired orientation.

### Next Steps
This updated implementation should address the issues identified in the feedback. If further issues arise, we can analyze the results and refine the calculations as needed. Let me know if additional clarification or adjustments are required!
