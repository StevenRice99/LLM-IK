It seems we are repeating the same forward kinematics results. Let me proceed with solving the inverse kinematics problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We are solving for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) of a 2-DOF serial manipulator. The manipulator has:
1. Revolute Joint 1 (R1) at the base.
2. Revolute Joint 2 (R2) at a position offset from R1.

The target position of the TCP (Tool Center Point) is given as \( p = [x, y, z] \), and the orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \). However, since the orientation of all links is zero, we only need to solve for the position.

---

### Step 2: Geometry of the Manipulator
From the details:
- Link 1 (R1 to R2): Offset \( [0, -0.1197, 0.425] \).
- Link 2 (R2 to TCP): Offset \( [0, 0, 0.39225] \).

The total length of the manipulator is:
\[
L_1 = 0.425 \quad \text{(length of first link)}
\]
\[
L_2 = 0.39225 \quad \text{(length of second link)}
\]

The TCP position relative to the base is:
\[
p = [x, y, z]
\]

---

### Step 3: Solving for Joint Angles
Using the geometry of the manipulator, we can solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using trigonometry.

#### 1. Compute the distance to the target
The projection of the target position in the plane of the manipulator is:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
\]

#### 2. Solve for \( \theta_2 \) (elbow angle)
Using the law of cosines:
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 \cdot L_1 \cdot L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{d^2 - L_1^2 - L_2^2}{2 \cdot L_1 \cdot L_2}\right)
\]

#### 3. Solve for \( \theta_1 \) (shoulder angle)
Using the law of sines and the geometry:
\[
\phi = \arctan2(z, x)
\]
\[
\psi = \arctan2\left(L_2 \cdot \sin(\theta_2), L_1 + L_2 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)\right)
\]
\[
\theta_1 = \phi - \psi
\]

---

### Step 4: Write the Python Function
Now, I will implement the above equations in the Python function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225

    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Compute the distance to the target in the manipulator's plane
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)

    # Solve for theta_2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta_1
    phi = math.atan2(z, x)
    psi = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = phi - psi

    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to reach the target position \( p \).
