To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to consider the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The provided solution for position-only inverse kinematics calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position. However, the orientation of the TCP is not yet accounted for.

### Analysis
1. **Position**: The existing solution calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to reach the target position \( p \). This part is already implemented.
2. **Orientation**: The orientation of the TCP is determined by the relative rotation of the links. Since both revolute joints rotate about the Y-axis, the orientation of the TCP in the global frame is a function of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). Specifically:
   - The total rotation about the Y-axis is the sum of the rotations of the two joints.

### Plan
1. Use the existing position-only inverse kinematics solution to calculate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) for the target position \( p \).
2. Adjust \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to ensure the target orientation \( r \) is achieved. Since the orientation is specified as a rotation about the Y-axis, we can directly compare the sum of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to the target orientation.

### Implementation
Here is the completed function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target orientation about the Y-axis
    target_orientation_y = r[1]
    
    # Step 1: Solve for position using the existing solution
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Step 2: Adjust for orientation
    # The total orientation is the sum of the joint angles
    total_orientation = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Adjust theta1 to match the target orientation
    orientation_error = target_orientation_y - total_orientation
    theta1 += orientation_error
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation
1. **Position Calculation**: The existing solution is used to calculate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) for the target position \( p \).
2. **Orientation Adjustment**: The total orientation of the TCP is the sum of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). To match the target orientation \( r[1] \), we calculate the orientation error and adjust \( \theta_1 \) accordingly.

This approach ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are achieved.
