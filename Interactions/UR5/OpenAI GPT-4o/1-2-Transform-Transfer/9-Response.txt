The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the current inverse kinematics implementation is not correctly solving for both position and orientation. The key issue lies in the orientation handling, as the position is sometimes correct but the orientation is not. Additionally, the joint values produced by the code are incorrect compared to the expected values.

### Observations
1. **Position**: The position calculation is sometimes correct, but in other cases, it fails to reach the target. This suggests that the position-only inverse kinematics logic may need refinement.
2. **Orientation**: The orientation is consistently incorrect. The forward kinematics results show that the orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles, but the current implementation does not properly account for this.

### Plan to Fix the Code
1. **Refine Position Calculation**: Ensure that the position-only inverse kinematics logic correctly calculates the joint angles for all reachable positions.
2. **Account for Orientation**: Modify the orientation handling to ensure that the sum of the joint angles matches the target orientation.

### Updated Approach
1. Use the existing position-only inverse kinematics logic to calculate initial joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
2. Adjust \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to ensure that the sum of the joint angles matches the target orientation.

### Implementation
Here is the updated function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target orientation about the Y-axis
    target_orientation_y = r[1]
    
    # Step 1: Solve for position using the existing solution
    x, y, z = p
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    
    # Step 2: Adjust for orientation
    # The total orientation is the sum of the joint angles
    total_orientation = theta1 + theta2
    
    # Adjust theta1 to match the target orientation
    orientation_error = target_orientation_y - total_orientation
    theta1 += orientation_error
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Next Steps
To verify the correctness of this implementation, I recommend testing it with the provided test cases. If further refinement is needed, I can analyze the results and adjust the logic accordingly.
