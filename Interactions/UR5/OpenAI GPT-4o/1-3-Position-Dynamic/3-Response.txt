To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the problem
- The manipulator has three revolute joints, all rotating about the Y-axis.
- The TCP position is influenced by the cumulative transformations of all three joints.
- The provided forward kinematics shows the positions of each link and the TCP.

### Step 2: Use existing solutions
- **Existing Code 1** solves for joint 2 (θ2) based on the target \( x \) and \( z \) coordinates.
- **Existing Code 2** solves for joints 5 and 6, but this is not directly relevant since we only have three joints.

### Step 3: Solve for θ1, θ2, and θ3
1. **θ1 (Joint 1):** This joint rotates the manipulator about the Y-axis. The target \( x \) and \( z \) coordinates determine its value.
2. **θ2 (Joint 2):** This joint adjusts the elevation of the arm to align with the target \( y \) coordinate.
3. **θ3 (Joint 3):** This joint adjusts the extension of the arm to reach the target \( z \) coordinate.

### Step 4: Write the solution
We will use trigonometric relationships and the geometry of the manipulator to compute the joint angles.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    d_tcp = 0.093  # Offset of the TCP along the Y-axis

    # Adjust target to account for TCP offset
    y_target_adjusted = y_target + d_tcp

    # Solve for θ1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)

    # Solve for θ2 (Joint 2)
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)  # Projection of the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + (y_target_adjusted - l1)**2)  # Distance to the target
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_target_adjusted - l1, r) - math.acos((l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d))

    # Solve for θ3 (Joint 3)
    theta3 = math.acos((l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)) - math.pi

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Adjusting for TCP Offset:** The TCP is offset along the Y-axis by 0.093 m. This is accounted for by adjusting the target \( y \)-coordinate.
2. **θ1 Calculation:** The angle θ1 is determined by the arctangent of the target \( x \) and \( z \) coordinates.
3. **θ2 Calculation:** Using the law of cosines and the geometry of the manipulator, θ2 is computed to align the arm with the target.
4. **θ3 Calculation:** The angle θ3 is computed using the law of cosines to ensure the arm extends correctly to reach the target.

This function returns the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) in radians.
