The error indicates that the `math.acos` function is being passed a value outside its valid domain, which is \([-1, 1]\). This typically happens when the computed value for the cosine of an angle is slightly outside this range due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations.

### Debugging the Issue
The problematic line is:
```python
theta2 = math.atan2(y_target_adjusted - l1, r) - math.acos((l1 ** 2 + d ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * d))
```

The term inside `math.acos` is:
```python
(l1 ** 2 + d ** 2 - l2 ** 2) / (2 * l1 * d)
```

This value must lie within the range \([-1, 1]\). If it doesn't, the `math.acos` function will raise a `ValueError`.

### Possible Causes
1. **Numerical Precision Issues:** Small floating-point inaccuracies can cause the value to slightly exceed the valid range.
2. **Incorrect Geometry or Target Position:** If the target position is not reachable (even though the problem states all targets are reachable), the computed value might be invalid.

### Fixing the Issue
To address this, we can:
1. Clamp the value passed to `math.acos` to the range \([-1, 1]\) to handle numerical inaccuracies.
2. Double-check the geometry and ensure the calculations are correct.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    d_tcp = 0.093  # Offset of the TCP along the Y-axis

    # Adjust target to account for TCP offset
    y_target_adjusted = y_target + d_tcp

    # Solve for θ1 (Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)

    # Solve for θ2 (Joint 2)
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)  # Projection of the target in the XZ plane
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + (y_target_adjusted - l1)**2)  # Distance to the target

    # Clamp the value for acos to the range [-1, 1]
    cos_angle = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    cos_angle = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_angle))  # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1]

    theta2 = math.atan2(y_target_adjusted - l1, r) - math.acos(cos_angle)

    # Solve for θ3 (Joint 3)
    cos_angle_3 = (l1**2 + l2**2 - d**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    cos_angle_3 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_angle_3))  # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1]

    theta3 = math.acos(cos_angle_3) - math.pi

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Clamping `cos_angle` and `cos_angle_3`:**
   - The values passed to `math.acos` are clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_angle = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_angle))
     ```
   - This ensures that even if numerical inaccuracies cause the value to slightly exceed the valid range, the function will not raise an error.

2. **Validation of Geometry:**
   - The calculations for \( r \), \( d \), and the angles are consistent with the manipulator's geometry.

### Testing
This corrected code should now handle all valid inputs without encountering a `ValueError`. If the issue persists, it may indicate a deeper problem with the target positions or the manipulator's geometry.
