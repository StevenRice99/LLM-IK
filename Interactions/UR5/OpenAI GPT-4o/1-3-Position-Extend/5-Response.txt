To solve the inverse kinematics for the full 3-DOF manipulator, we need to extend the provided solution for the first two links to include the third link and the TCP. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Understand the Existing Solution**: The provided solution calculates the angles for the first two joints (`theta1` and `theta2`) to position the end of the second link (just before the third link) at the target position in the XZ-plane.

2. **Incorporate the Third Link**: The third link extends along the Y-axis of the second link's frame. The TCP is offset along the Y-axis by `0.093` units. We need to calculate the angle for the third joint (`theta3`) to align the TCP with the target position.

3. **Adjust for the TCP Offset**: The TCP's position is offset along the Y-axis. This offset must be accounted for when calculating the joint angles.

4. **Combine the Angles**: Return the three joint angles (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`) as the solution.

Now, let's complete the `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link
    d3 = 0.093  # Offset of the TCP along the Y-axis

    # Step 1: Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target + d3

    # Step 2: Solve for the first two joints using the existing solution
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - beta

    # Step 3: Solve for the third joint
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta2

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position `p`. It uses the provided solution for the first two joints and extends it to include the third joint and the TCP offset.
