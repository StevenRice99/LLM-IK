The forward kinematics results confirm the correct joint values for the target position and orientation. I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to ensure it produces the correct joint values for all targets.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results show the correct joint values `[2.346217957379197, -1.098752488635364, -2.76030585156265]` produce the desired position `[0.675428065945013, -0.0267, -0.172879074530488]` and orientation `[0, -1.512840382818817, 0]`.
2. The current inverse kinematics function fails to compute these values correctly due to oversimplified calculations for joint angles.

### Plan for Revision:
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Chain**:
   - Use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters or geometric relationships to compute each joint angle.
   - Account for the offsets and link lengths in the calculations.

2. **Incorporate Orientation**:
   - Ensure the orientation `[roll, pitch, yaw]` is considered when solving for joint angles.

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Test the revised function against the provided feedback and adjust as needed.

### Revised Implementation:
Here is the updated inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.1197  # Offset along Y for Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.425   # Offset along Z for Revolute 2
    d3 = 0.39225 # Offset along Z for Revolute 3
    tcp_offset = 0.093  # Offset along Y for TCP

    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    adjusted_y = y - tcp_offset

    # Solve for joint 1 (theta1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Compute the position of the wrist center (WC)
    wc_x = x
    wc_y = adjusted_y
    wc_z = z - d2

    # Solve for joint 2 (theta2) using geometric relationships
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    s = wc_y - d1                    # Distance in the Y direction
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)       # Total distance to the wrist center

    # Law of cosines to find the angle at joint 2
    cos_theta2 = (d2**2 + d**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * d)
    theta2 = math.atan2(s, r) - math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for joint 3 (theta3) using the remaining geometry
    cos_theta3 = (d2**2 + d3**2 - d**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3) - math.pi

    # Adjust theta3 to account for the orientation
    theta3 += pitch

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This revised function incorporates the geometric relationships and offsets in the kinematic chain. It should now produce the correct joint values for all targets. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
