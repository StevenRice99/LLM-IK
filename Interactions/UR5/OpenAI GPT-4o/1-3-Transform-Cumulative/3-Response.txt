To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [roll, pitch, yaw] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions of each link:
- Revolute 1: Base position at \([0, 0, 0]\).
- Revolute 2: Offset by \([0, -0.1197, 0.425]\).
- Revolute 3: Offset by \([0, -0.1197, 0.81725]\).
- TCP: Offset by \([0, -0.0267, 0.81725]\).

The TCP position is influenced by the rotations of the three revolute joints. The axes of rotation for all joints are along the \( Y \)-axis.

### Step 2: Use Existing Solutions
The existing solutions provide partial inverse kinematics for sub-chains:
1. **Existing Code 1**: Solves for \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position.
2. **Existing Code 2**: Solves for \( \theta_3 \) based on the target position.
3. **Existing Code 3**: Solves for \( \theta_3 \) and \( \theta_4 \) (not applicable here since we only have 3 DOF).
4. **Existing Code 4**: Solves for \( \theta_4 \) (not applicable here).

We will combine these solutions to compute \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint rotates the entire arm around the \( Y \)-axis. The projection of the target position \( p \) onto the \( XZ \)-plane determines \( \theta_1 \). Using the geometry:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The second joint determines the elevation of the arm. Using the existing solution (Existing Code 1), we can compute \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position.

### Step 5: Solve for \( \theta_3 \)
The third joint adjusts the position of the TCP along the arm's length. Using the existing solution (Existing Code 2), we can compute \( \theta_3 \).

### Step 6: Combine the Solutions
We will combine the solutions for \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) into a single function.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Solve for theta_2 using Existing Code 1
    theta_2 = -math.atan2(-x, z)

    # Solve for theta_3 using Existing Code 2
    theta_3 = math.atan2(x, z)

    return theta_1, theta_2, theta_3
```

This function combines the solutions for all three joints to compute the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator.
