It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. I will now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function step by step.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Understand the Target Position and Orientation**:
   - The target position `p` is given as `[x, y, z]`.
   - The target orientation `r` is given as `[roll, pitch, yaw]`.

2. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - Use the provided solutions for sub-chains to calculate each joint angle.
   - Start with the TCP position and work backward to calculate the joint angles.

3. **Use Existing Solutions**:
   - Use the existing solutions for joint 1, joint 2, and joint 3 to calculate the respective angles.

4. **Combine Results**:
   - Return the calculated joint angles as a tuple `(theta1, theta2, theta3)`.

### Implementation:
Here is the completed inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 1 (theta1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Adjust the position for joint 2 calculations
    # Subtract the contribution of joint 1 from the target position
    adjusted_x = x
    adjusted_y = y + 0.1197  # Offset from Revolute 2
    adjusted_z = z - 0.425  # Offset from Revolute 2
    
    # Solve for joint 2 (theta2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Adjust the position for joint 3 calculations
    # Subtract the contribution of joint 2 from the target position
    adjusted_z -= 0.39225  # Offset from Revolute 3
    
    # Solve for joint 3 (theta3)
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to reach the given target position and orientation. Let me know if further clarification or testing is needed!
