The forward kinematics results provide the positions and orientations of each link when the joint angles are set to the correct values \([2.346217957379197, -1.098752488635364, -2.76030585156265]\). This information will help refine the inverse kinematics solution.

### Observations from Forward Kinematics:
1. **Revolute 1**:
   - Base position remains at \([0, 0, 0]\).
   - Orientation is \([3.141592653589793, 0.7953746962105965, 3.141592653589793]\), indicating a rotation about the \( Y \)-axis.

2. **Revolute 2**:
   - Position is \([0.3035035282675518, -0.1197, -0.2975073248327634]\).
   - Orientation is \([0, 1.2474654687438331, 0]\), indicating a rotation about the \( Y \)-axis.

### Refining the Inverse Kinematics Solution:
The forward kinematics confirms that the joint angles \([2.346217957379197, -1.098752488635364, -2.76030585156265]\) produce the correct TCP position and orientation. To refine the inverse kinematics function, we need to:
1. Correctly compute the contributions of each joint to the TCP position and orientation.
2. Ensure the joint angles are calculated sequentially, considering the geometry and constraints of the manipulator.

I will now refine the inverse kinematics function step by step.
Here is the refined inverse kinematics function, taking into account the geometry of the manipulator and the forward kinematics results:

### Step-by-Step Refinement:
1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - The first joint rotates the arm around the \( Y \)-axis. The projection of the target position \( p \) onto the \( XZ \)-plane determines \( \theta_1 \):
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
   \]

2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - The second joint determines the elevation of the arm. Using the geometry of the manipulator, we calculate the effective length and height of the target position relative to the base of the second joint. This involves trigonometry to compute the angle.

3. **Solve for \( \theta_3 \)**:
   - The third joint adjusts the position of the TCP along the arm's length. Using the remaining distance and orientation, we compute \( \theta_3 \).

### Updated Python Code:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    d_tcp = 0.093  # Offset of TCP along Z-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta_2
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - d_tcp * math.cos(pitch)
    x_adjusted = x - d_tcp * math.sin(pitch)

    # Compute the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_adjusted**2 + z_adjusted**2)

    # Use the law of cosines to compute theta_2
    cos_theta_2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta_2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta_2**2), cos_theta_2)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta_3
    # Use the law of cosines to compute the angle between link 1 and the target
    cos_alpha = (l1**2 + r**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    alpha = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_alpha**2), cos_alpha)

    # Compute the angle of the target relative to the base
    beta = math.atan2(z_adjusted, x_adjusted)

    # Compute theta_3
    theta_3 = beta - alpha

    return theta_1, theta_2, theta_3
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Link Lengths**:
   - The lengths of the links and the TCP offset are used to adjust the target position and compute the joint angles.

2. **Theta 1**:
   - The first joint angle is computed using the projection of the target position onto the \( XZ \)-plane.

3. **Theta 2**:
   - The second joint angle is computed using the law of cosines, considering the geometry of the manipulator.

4. **Theta 3**:
   - The third joint angle is computed by combining the angles from the target position and the geometry of the links.

This refined function should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target position and orientation.
