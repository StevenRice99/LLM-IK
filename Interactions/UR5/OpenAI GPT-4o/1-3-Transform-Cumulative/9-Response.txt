The error occurs because the value of `cos_theta_2` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function. Specifically, the square root operation in `math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta_2 ** 2)` fails when `cos_theta_2` is slightly greater than 1 or less than -1 due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations.

### Root Cause:
The value of `cos_theta_2` is calculated as:
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 \cdot l_1 \cdot l_2}
\]
If the computed value of `cos_theta_2` is outside the range \([-1, 1]\), it indicates that:
1. The target position is unreachable (which we assume is not the case here).
2. Numerical inaccuracies or incorrect adjustments to the target position are causing the issue.

### Solution:
To fix this, we need to:
1. Clamp the value of `cos_theta_2` to the valid range \([-1, 1]\) before using it in the `math.sqrt` function.
2. Double-check the adjustments to the target position to ensure they are correct.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    d_tcp = 0.093  # Offset of TCP along Z-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta_2
    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - d_tcp * math.cos(pitch)
    x_adjusted = x - d_tcp * math.sin(pitch)

    # Compute the distance from the base to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_adjusted**2 + z_adjusted**2)

    # Use the law of cosines to compute theta_2
    cos_theta_2 = (r**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Clamp cos_theta_2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta_2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta_2))
    theta_2 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta_2 ** 2), cos_theta_2)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta_3
    # Use the law of cosines to compute the angle between link 1 and the target
    cos_alpha = (l1**2 + r**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * r)
    # Clamp cos_alpha to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_alpha = max(-1, min(1, cos_alpha))
    alpha = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - cos_alpha**2), cos_alpha)

    # Compute the angle of the target relative to the base
    beta = math.atan2(z_adjusted, x_adjusted)

    # Compute theta_3
    theta_3 = beta - alpha

    return theta_1, theta_2, theta_3
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta_2`**:
   - Before using `cos_theta_2` in `math.sqrt`, we ensure it is within the valid range \([-1, 1]\):
     ```python
     cos_theta_2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta_2))
     ```

2. **Clamping `cos_alpha`**:
   - Similarly, we clamp `cos_alpha` to avoid math domain errors:
     ```python
     cos_alpha = max(-1, min(1, cos_alpha))
     ```

3. **Numerical Stability**:
   - These clamps ensure that small numerical inaccuracies do not cause the function to fail.

### Explanation of Changes:
- The clamping ensures that the values passed to `math.sqrt` and `math.atan2` are always valid, even if there are small numerical errors in the calculations.
- The rest of the logic remains the same, as it correctly computes the joint angles based on the manipulator's geometry.

This updated function should now handle all valid inputs without encountering math domain errors. Let me know if further refinements are needed!
