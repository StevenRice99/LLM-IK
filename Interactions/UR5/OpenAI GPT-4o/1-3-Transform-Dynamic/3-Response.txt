To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p \) and orientation \( r \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understand the Forward Kinematics**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by the three revolute joints.
   - The positions of the links are given in the table, and the TCP position is the result of the cumulative transformations.

2. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - Use the provided sub-solutions for each joint to compute the angles step by step.
   - Start with the first joint, then proceed to the second and third.

3. **Use the Existing Solutions**:
   - The existing solutions provide a way to compute the joint angles for sub-chains. These can be adapted to solve for the full chain.

4. **Compute the Joint Angles**:
   - Use the target position \( p \) and orientation \( r \) to compute the angles for each joint.

Let me now proceed to implement the solution for the inverse kinematics.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    px, py, pz = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Joint 1)
    # Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis, so we use the x and z coordinates of the target position
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (Joint 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset in the Y direction is 0.093, so we subtract it from py
    py_adjusted = py - 0.093

    # The position of the second joint relative to the base
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Compute the distance from the base to the adjusted target position
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    s = py_adjusted - d1

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for theta2
    D = (r**2 + s**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2))
    theta2 = math.atan2(s, r) - math.acos(D)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (Joint 3)
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for theta3
    D3 = (r**2 + s**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    theta3 = math.acos(D3)

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
