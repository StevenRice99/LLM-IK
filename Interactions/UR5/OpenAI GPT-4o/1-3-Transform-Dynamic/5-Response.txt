The error indicates that the value passed to `math.acos()` is outside its valid domain, which is \([-1, 1]\). This typically happens when there is an issue with the calculation of \( D3 \), which is derived from the law of cosines. If \( D3 \) is slightly greater than 1 or less than -1 due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations, the `math.acos()` function will raise a `ValueError`.

### Steps to Fix the Issue:
1. **Clamp the Value of \( D3 \):**
   - Ensure that \( D3 \) is always within the valid range of \([-1, 1]\) before passing it to `math.acos()`. This can be done using `max(-1, min(1, D3))`.

2. **Revisit the Calculation of \( D3 \):**
   - Double-check the formula for \( D3 \) to ensure it is correct. The formula depends on the geometry of the manipulator and the law of cosines.

3. **Check for Numerical Stability:**
   - Numerical inaccuracies can arise when performing operations like square roots or divisions. Ensure that all intermediate calculations are stable and within valid ranges.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected version of the `inverse_kinematics` function with the clamping fix applied:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    px, py, pz = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Joint 1)
    # Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis, so we use the x and z coordinates of the target position
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (Joint 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP offset in the Y direction is 0.093, so we subtract it from py
    py_adjusted = py - 0.093

    # The position of the second joint relative to the base
    d1 = 0.425  # Length of the first link
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length of the second link

    # Compute the distance from the base to the adjusted target position
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)
    s = py_adjusted - d1

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for theta2
    D = (r**2 + s**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2))
    theta2 = math.atan2(s, r) - math.acos(max(-1, min(1, D)))  # Clamp D to [-1, 1]

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (Joint 3)
    # Use the law of cosines to solve for theta3
    D3 = (r**2 + s**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    theta3 = math.acos(max(-1, min(1, D3)))  # Clamp D3 to [-1, 1]

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Clamping \( D \) and \( D3 \):**
   - The values of \( D \) and \( D3 \) are clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using `max(-1, min(1, value))`. This ensures that `math.acos()` always receives a valid input.

2. **Numerical Stability:**
   - The clamping ensures that small numerical errors do not cause the function to fail.

### Next Steps:
- Test the updated code with various valid inputs to ensure it works correctly.
- If further issues arise, revisit the geometry and calculations to ensure they align with the manipulator's kinematics.
