To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF manipulator, we will break the problem into steps:

1. **Revolute Joint 1 (θ1):**  
   This joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its value can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and calculating the angle.

2. **Revolute Joint 2 (θ2):**  
   This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. Its value can be determined by solving the sub-chain from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2, using the provided existing code for joint 2.

3. **Revolute Joint 3 (θ3):**  
   This joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its value can be determined by solving the sub-chain from Revolute 2 to the TCP, using the provided forward kinematics data.

Let me now complete the Python function for the inverse kinematics solution.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (Revolute Joint 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 (Revolute Joint 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of Revolute 2
    x_adjusted = x_target
    z_adjusted = z_target - 0.425  # Offset along Z-axis due to Revolute 2
    theta2 = -math.atan2(-x_adjusted, z_adjusted)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ3 (Revolute Joint 3)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of Revolute 3
    z_adjusted_3 = z_target - 0.81725  # Offset along Z-axis due to Revolute 3
    theta3 = -math.atan2(-x_adjusted, z_adjusted_3)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to reach the target position and orientation. The offsets for each joint are derived from the forward kinematics data provided.
