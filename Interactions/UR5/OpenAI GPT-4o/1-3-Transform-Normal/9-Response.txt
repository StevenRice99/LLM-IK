Let's now proceed to solve the inverse kinematics analytically.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - The robot has 3 revolute joints, all rotating about the Y-axis.
   - The task is to compute the joint angles (`θ1`, `θ2`, `θ3`) to reach a given target position `p` and orientation `r`.

2. **Kinematic Chain**:
   - The position of the TCP is influenced by the joint angles and the link lengths.
   - The forward kinematics equations can be inverted to solve for the joint angles.

3. **Approach**:
   - Use the target position `p` to compute the joint angles.
   - Since the orientation `r` is [0, 0, 0] for all configurations, it does not affect the solution.

4. **Equations**:
   - The TCP position is derived from the forward kinematics:
     \[
     p_x = L_2 \sin(θ_2) + L_3 \sin(θ_2 + θ_3)
     \]
     \[
     p_y = 0 \quad (\text{since all rotations are about the Y-axis})
     \]
     \[
     p_z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(θ_2) + L_3 \cos(θ_2 + θ_3)
     \]
   - Solve these equations for `θ1`, `θ2`, and `θ3`.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Use trigonometric identities and algebra to isolate the joint angles.
   - Implement the solution in Python.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.093  # Offset of the TCP along Z-axis

    # Target position
    px, py, pz = p

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1
    # Since all rotations are about the Y-axis, θ1 does not affect the position in this case.
    θ1 = 0  # No rotation about the Y-axis for this configuration

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 and θ3
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    pz_adjusted = pz - L3

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ2 and θ3
    D = (pz_adjusted**2 + px**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    θ3 = math.atan2(math.sqrt(1 - D**2), D)  # θ3 is the angle between L1 and L2

    # Solve for θ2 using trigonometry
    θ2 = math.atan2(pz_adjusted, px) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(θ3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(θ3))

    return θ1, θ2, θ3
```

### Explanation:
- **θ1**: Since all rotations are about the Y-axis and the TCP lies in the XZ-plane, `θ1` is always 0.
- **θ2, θ3**: Derived using the law of cosines and trigonometric relationships.

This function computes the joint angles to reach the target position `p` and orientation `r`.
