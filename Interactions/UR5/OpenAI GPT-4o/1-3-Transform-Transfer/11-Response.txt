The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still failing to compute the correct joint angles for both position and orientation. The primary issues seem to be:

1. **Position Errors**:
   - The computed positions are significantly off from the target positions in many cases.
   - This suggests that the position calculations (based on the existing solution) are not being applied correctly.

2. **Orientation Errors**:
   - While the orientation matches in some cases, the joint angles are incorrect, leading to incorrect positions.

3. **Correct Joint Values**:
   - The feedback provides the correct joint values for each test case, which can be used to validate and refine the solution.

### Revised Approach
To address these issues, I will:
1. **Revisit the Position Calculation**:
   - Ensure that the law of cosines and trigonometric relationships are applied correctly.
   - Verify the handling of the TCP offset.

2. **Incorporate Orientation Properly**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the cumulative rotations of the joints. This needs to be explicitly accounted for.

3. **Validate Against Correct Joint Values**:
   - Use the provided correct joint values to validate the revised solution.

### Updated Plan
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - Use the law of cosines to compute `theta2` and ensure the correct quadrant is selected.
   - Compute `theta1` and `theta3` based on the geometry of the manipulator.

2. **Orientation Adjustment**:
   - Compute the total orientation of the TCP as the sum of the joint angles.
   - Adjust the joint angles to match the target orientation.

3. **Validation**:
   - Compare the computed joint angles with the correct joint values provided in the feedback.

### Updated Code
Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    _, ry_target, _ = r  # Only consider pitch (rotation about Y-axis)

    # Link lengths
    d1 = 0.425
    d2 = 0.39225
    d3 = 0.093

    # Adjust y_target for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target + d3

    # Calculate the distance to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - beta

    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta2

    # Adjust for orientation
    # The total orientation of the TCP is the sum of the joint angles
    total_orientation = theta1 + theta2 + theta3
    orientation_error = ry_target - total_orientation

    # Distribute the orientation error across the joints
    theta1 += orientation_error / 3
    theta2 += orientation_error / 3
    theta3 += orientation_error / 3

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Next Steps
1. **Validation**:
   - Test the revised implementation against the provided test cases.
   - Verify that the computed joint angles match the correct joint values.

2. **Further Refinement**:
   - If the revised implementation still fails, analyze the specific test cases to identify the root cause of the errors.
   - Refine the calculations as needed.
