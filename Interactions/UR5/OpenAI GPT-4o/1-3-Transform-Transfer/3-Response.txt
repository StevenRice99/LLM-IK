To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to account for the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The provided solution for position-only inverse kinematics gives us a good starting point, but we need to extend it to include the orientation.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Position Adjustment**: Adjust the target position `p` to account for the TCP offset.
2. **Position IK**: Use the existing position-only IK solution to calculate the joint angles for position (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`).
3. **Orientation Adjustment**: Compute the orientation of the TCP using the given target orientation `r` and adjust the third joint (`theta3`) to align the TCP orientation.

The orientation of the TCP is determined by the cumulative rotations of all joints. Since all joints rotate about the Y-axis, the orientation of the TCP in the global frame is the sum of the rotations of the three joints. Therefore, the third joint angle (`theta3`) can be adjusted to match the desired orientation.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r  # Orientation in radians

    # Adjust position for TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2

    # Solve for theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta

    # Solve for theta3 to match the desired orientation
    # Since all joints rotate about the Y-axis, the total rotation is the sum of all joint angles
    theta3 = ry - (theta1 + theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position IK**:
   - The position-only IK solution is reused to calculate `theta1` and `theta2` based on the target position `p`.
   - The TCP offset is subtracted from the Y-coordinate to adjust for the end-effector's position.

2. **Orientation IK**:
   - The desired orientation `ry` (rotation about the Y-axis) is used to compute `theta3`.
   - The total rotation of the TCP is the sum of the rotations of all joints. Therefore, `theta3` is calculated as the difference between the desired orientation and the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`.

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns the joint angles (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`) in radians.

This solution ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are achieved.
