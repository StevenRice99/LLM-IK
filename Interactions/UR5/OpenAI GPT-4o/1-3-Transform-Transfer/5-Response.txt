The feedback indicates that the position is being reached correctly, but the orientation is not being achieved. The issue lies in how the orientation is being handled. Specifically, the solution does not account for the fact that the orientation of the TCP is cumulative across all joints, and the desired orientation is not being properly matched.

### Observations:
1. The orientation of the TCP is represented as `[rx, ry, rz]`, but the current implementation only considers `ry` (rotation about the Y-axis). This is incorrect because the TCP's orientation in the global frame is influenced by all three joints.
2. The feedback shows that the correct joint values differ significantly from the ones produced by the code, especially for `theta3`. This suggests that the calculation of `theta3` is flawed.

### Plan to Fix:
1. **Revisit Orientation Handling**:
   - The TCP's orientation in the global frame is the cumulative effect of all joint rotations. This means that the desired orientation `[rx, ry, rz]` must be matched by the sum of the rotations of all joints.
   - Since all joints rotate about the Y-axis, the desired `ry` must be matched by the sum of `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3`.

2. **Adjust `theta3` Calculation**:
   - The current calculation of `theta3` assumes that the desired orientation is only influenced by `theta3`. This is incorrect because `theta1` and `theta2` also contribute to the TCP's orientation.
   - To fix this, `theta3` should be calculated as the difference between the desired `ry` and the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`.

3. **Account for Full Orientation**:
   - The desired orientation `[rx, ry, rz]` must be matched in all axes. However, since the robot only rotates about the Y-axis, the solution should focus on matching `ry` while ensuring that the other axes (`rx` and `rz`) are consistent with the robot's constraints.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r  # Orientation in radians

    # Adjust position for TCP offset
    tcp_offset = 0.093
    x_adj = x
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset
    z_adj = z

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    d = math.sqrt(x_adj ** 2 + z_adj ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Determine the sign of theta2 based on the cross product
    cross_product = x_adj * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - z_adj * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2

    # Solve for theta1
    alpha = math.atan2(x_adj, z_adj)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta

    # Solve for theta3 to match the desired orientation
    # The total rotation about the Y-axis must match the desired ry
    theta3 = ry - (theta1 + theta2)

    # Ensure theta3 is within joint limits
    theta3 = (theta3 + math.pi) % (2 * math.pi) - math.pi  # Normalize to [-pi, pi]

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Orientation Matching**:
   - The total rotation about the Y-axis (`theta1 + theta2 + theta3`) is now explicitly matched to the desired `ry`.

2. **Normalization**:
   - `theta3` is normalized to the range `[-pi, pi]` to ensure it stays within joint limits.

3. **Consistency**:
   - The solution ensures that the position and orientation are both achieved simultaneously.

### Next Steps:
Test the updated code on the provided test cases to verify that it correctly reaches both the position and orientation targets. If further adjustments are needed, analyze the results and refine the solution accordingly.
