The feedback indicates that the current implementation fails to compute the correct joint angles for both position and orientation. The primary issue seems to be the incorrect handling of the orientation component, as well as potential inaccuracies in the position calculations. To address these issues, I will revise the approach step by step.

### Observations from Feedback
1. **Position Errors**:
   - The computed positions are significantly off from the target positions in many cases.
   - This suggests that the position calculations (based on the existing solution) need to be revisited.

2. **Orientation Errors**:
   - The orientation component is not being handled correctly. The feedback shows that the computed orientations match the target orientations in some cases, but the joint angles are incorrect.

3. **Correct Joint Values**:
   - The feedback provides the correct joint values for each test case. These can be used to validate the revised solution.

### Revised Approach
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - Revisit the position calculations to ensure they are accurate. This includes verifying the use of the law of cosines and the trigonometric relationships.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - Incorporate the orientation component into the calculations. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the cumulative rotations of the joints. This needs to be explicitly accounted for.

3. **Validation**:
   - Use the provided correct joint values to validate the revised solution.

### Revised Code
Here is the updated implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    _, ry_target, _ = r  # Only consider pitch (rotation about Y-axis)

    # Link lengths
    d1 = 0.425
    d2 = 0.39225
    d3 = 0.093

    # Adjust y_target for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target + d3

    # Calculate the distance to the target in the XZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_target ** 2)

    # Solve for theta2 using the law of cosines
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - beta

    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta2

    # Adjust for orientation
    # The total orientation of the TCP is the sum of the joint angles
    total_orientation = theta1 + theta2 + theta3
    orientation_error = ry_target - total_orientation

    # Distribute the orientation error across the joints
    theta1 += orientation_error / 3
    theta2 += orientation_error / 3
    theta3 += orientation_error / 3

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Next Steps
1. **Validation**:
   - Test the revised implementation against the provided test cases.
   - Verify that the computed joint angles match the correct joint values.

2. **Further Refinement**:
   - If the revised implementation still fails, analyze the specific test cases to identify the root cause of the errors.
   - Refine the calculations as needed.
