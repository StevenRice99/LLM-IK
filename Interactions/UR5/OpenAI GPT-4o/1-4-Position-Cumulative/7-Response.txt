To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 4-DOF manipulator, I will now complete the Python function step by step. The goal is to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) required to reach the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (θ1)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The angle θ1 can be determined based on the projection of the target position \( p \) onto the XZ-plane.
2. **Joint 2 (θ2)**: Using the sub-chain from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2, calculate θ2 based on the target position and the geometry of the manipulator.
3. **Joint 3 (θ3)**: Extend the solution to include the third joint, considering the position of Revolute 3.
4. **Joint 4 (θ4)**: Finally, solve for θ4, which adjusts the end-effector to align with the target position.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p

    # Link lengths
    d1 = 0.425    # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    d3 = 0.093    # Offset for Revolute 4
    d4 = 0.09465  # Offset for TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (Joint 1)
    # θ1 is the angle in the XZ-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x_target, z_target)

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 (Joint 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of Revolute 4 and TCP
    y_adjusted = y_target - d3 - d4
    r = math.sqrt(x_target**2 + z_target**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 + y_adjusted**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Assume the positive solution
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ3 (Joint 3)
    # θ3 is the angle to align the third link
    phi = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta3 = phi - beta

    # Step 4: Solve for θ4 (Joint 4)
    # θ4 aligns the TCP with the target position
    theta4 = 0.0  # Assuming no additional rotation is needed for alignment

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Explanation:
1. **θ1**: The first joint angle is calculated using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
2. **θ2**: The second joint angle is determined using the law of cosines, considering the geometry of the manipulator.
3. **θ3**: The third joint angle is calculated by adjusting for the offset of the third link and the TCP.
4. **θ4**: The fourth joint angle is set to 0, assuming no additional rotation is required for alignment.

This function provides the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \).
