Understood. I will now proceed to solve the inverse kinematics problem step by step.

To solve for the inverse kinematics of the 4-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4)\) that position the TCP at the given target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). Here's the plan:

1. **Joint 1 (\(\theta_1\))**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. We can calculate \(\theta_1\) using the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane.
2. **Joint 2 (\(\theta_2\))**: This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. Using the geometry of the arm, we can calculate \(\theta_2\) based on the target position and the lengths of the links.
3. **Joint 3 (\(\theta_3\))**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. It can be determined by considering the remaining distance to the target after accounting for the contributions of the first two joints.
4. **Joint 4 (\(\theta_4\))**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. It can be calculated based on the orientation of the TCP.

I will now write the Python code to compute these joint angles.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.09465  # Offset from Revolute 4 to TCP
    d4 = 0.093  # Offset along Y-axis for Revolute 4

    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    z_adj = z - L3
    y_adj = y - d4

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z_adj)

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using planar geometry
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z_adj**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(d**2 + y_adj**2)  # Total distance to the target

    # Law of cosines to find theta2 and theta3
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    sin_theta3 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)  # Sine of theta3
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_adj, d) - math.atan2(L2 * sin_theta3, L1 + L2 * cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta4 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta4 = math.atan2(y, x)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the given target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). Let me know if further clarification or testing is needed!
