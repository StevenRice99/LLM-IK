To extend the inverse kinematics solution to include the fourth joint, we need to account for the additional offset introduced by Revolute 4 and the TCP. The provided solution already calculates the angles for the first three joints to position the end of the third link. Now, we need to determine the angle for the fourth joint to align the TCP with the target position.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. Use the existing solution to calculate the angles for the first three joints (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`).
2. Compute the position of the end of the third link (before Revolute 4) using forward kinematics.
3. Determine the required rotation of Revolute 4 (`theta4`) to align the TCP with the target position.

Let's complete the function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    d1 = 0.425
    d2 = 0.39225
    d3 = 0.093
    d_tcp = 0.09465  # Offset from Revolute 4 to TCP
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target + d3
    z_adjusted = z_target - d_tcp
    
    # Solve for the first three joints using the existing solution
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_adjusted ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_adjusted)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - beta
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta2
    
    # Compute the position of the end of the third link
    x3 = d1 * math.sin(theta1) + d2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    y3 = y_adjusted
    z3 = d1 * math.cos(theta1) + d2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Determine the angle for the fourth joint
    dx = x_target - x3
    dy = y_target - y3
    dz = z_target - z3
    theta4 = math.atan2(dy, dz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates the joint angles for all four revolute joints to position the TCP at the target position.
