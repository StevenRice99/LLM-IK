To extend the provided solution for the inverse kinematics of the first three links to include the fourth link, we need to account for the additional offset introduced by Revolute 4 and the TCP. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Adjust the Target Position**: The target position `p` needs to be adjusted to account for the offset introduced by the TCP and Revolute 4. This adjustment ensures that the calculations for the first three joints remain valid.

2. **Solve for the First Three Joints**: Use the provided solution to calculate the angles for Revolute 1, Revolute 2, and Revolute 3.

3. **Solve for the Fourth Joint**: The fourth joint rotates about the Z-axis. Its angle can be determined by aligning the orientation of the TCP with the target orientation. Since the orientation is not specified in the problem, we assume the TCP's orientation aligns with the Z-axis.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    tcp_offset = 0.09465  # Offset of the TCP
    link4_offset = 0.093  # Offset of Revolute 4
    adjusted_y = y - link4_offset  # Adjust for Revolute 4 offset
    adjusted_z = z - tcp_offset  # Adjust for TCP offset

    # Solve for the first three joints using the provided solution
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + adjusted_z ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - adjusted_z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, adjusted_z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    theta3 = 0  # Assuming no additional rotation for Revolute 3

    # Solve for the fourth joint
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, y)  # Align with the Z-axis

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the specified target position `p`. It first adjusts the target position to account for the offsets introduced by Revolute 4 and the TCP, then calculates the angles for the first three joints using the provided solution, and finally determines the angle for the fourth joint.
