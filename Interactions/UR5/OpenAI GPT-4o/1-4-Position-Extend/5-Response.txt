The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the valid range for the `math.sqrt` function, which is causing a "math domain error." Specifically, the value of `cos_theta2` is likely less than -1 or greater than 1, which is invalid for computing the square root of `1 - cos_theta2^2`.

This issue arises due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect assumptions in the calculation of `cos_theta2`. Let's address this step by step:

---

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **`cos_theta2` Calculation**:
   ```python
   cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
   ```
   The value of `cos_theta2` is derived from the law of cosines. However, due to floating-point precision errors or incorrect input values, `cos_theta2` might slightly exceed the range of [-1, 1].

2. **`math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)`**:
   If `cos_theta2` is outside the range [-1, 1], the term `1 - cos_theta2 ** 2` becomes negative, leading to a math domain error when attempting to compute the square root.

---

### Solution:
To fix this, we need to:
1. Clamp the value of `cos_theta2` to the range [-1, 1] before computing `sin_theta2`.
2. Ensure that the inputs to the function are correctly adjusted to account for the TCP offset.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_target, y_target, z_target = p
    d1 = 0.425
    d2 = 0.39225
    d3 = 0.093
    d_tcp = 0.09465  # Offset from Revolute 4 to TCP
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y_target + d3
    z_adjusted = z_target - d_tcp
    
    # Solve for the first three joints using the existing solution
    r = math.sqrt(x_target ** 2 + z_adjusted ** 2)
    cos_theta2 = (r ** 2 - d1 ** 2 - d2 ** 2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
    
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)
    phi = math.atan2(x_target, z_adjusted)
    beta = math.atan2(d2 * sin_theta2, d1 + d2 * cos_theta2)
    theta1 = phi - beta
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, r) - theta2
    
    # Compute the position of the end of the third link
    x3 = d1 * math.sin(theta1) + d2 * math.sin(theta1 + theta2)
    y3 = y_adjusted
    z3 = d1 * math.cos(theta1) + d2 * math.cos(theta1 + theta2)
    
    # Determine the angle for the fourth joint
    dx = x_target - x3
    dy = y_target - y3
    dz = z_target - z3
    theta4 = math.atan2(dy, dz)
    
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

---

### Key Fixes:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`**:
   ```python
   cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))
   ```
   This ensures that `cos_theta2` is always within the valid range for trigonometric functions.

2. **Adjusted Target Position**:
   The target position is adjusted to account for the TCP offset (`d_tcp`) and the offset introduced by Revolute 4 (`d3`).
