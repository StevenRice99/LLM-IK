The error `ValueError: math domain error` occurs because the value of `cos_theta2` is outside the valid range for the `math.acos` function, which is [-1, 1]. This issue arises due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect adjustments in the calculations.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `cos_theta2` is clamped to the valid range before passing it to `math.acos`. Additionally, I will carefully review the adjustments for the offsets of Revolute 4 and the TCP to ensure they are applied correctly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    tcp_offset = 0.09465  # Offset of the TCP
    link4_offset = 0.093  # Offset of Revolute 4
    adjusted_y = y - link4_offset  # Adjust for Revolute 4 offset
    adjusted_z = z - tcp_offset  # Adjust for TCP offset

    # Solve for the first three joints using the provided solution
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + adjusted_z ** 2)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - adjusted_z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, adjusted_z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta
    theta3 = 0  # Assuming no additional rotation for Revolute 3

    # Solve for the fourth joint
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, y)  # Align with the Z-axis

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2`**: The value of `cos_theta2` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] using `max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))`. This ensures that `math.acos` does not encounter invalid inputs.

2. **Offset Adjustments**: The offsets for Revolute 4 and the TCP are carefully applied to the `y` and `z` coordinates, respectively.

### Explanation of Changes:
- The clamping ensures that even if numerical inaccuracies cause `cos_theta2` to slightly exceed the valid range, the function will still work correctly.
- The adjustments for the offsets ensure that the target position is correctly transformed into the coordinate frame of the first three joints.

This corrected code should now work without encountering the `math domain error`. Let me know if further issues arise!
