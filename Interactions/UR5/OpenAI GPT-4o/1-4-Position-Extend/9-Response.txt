The feedback indicates that the current implementation fails to reach the target positions accurately. The primary issue seems to be with the computation of the joint angles, particularly for Revolute 3 and Revolute 4. The provided joint values from the correct inverse kinematics solver suggest that Revolute 3 is not always zero, and Revolute 4 is consistently zero in the correct solutions, which contradicts the current implementation.

### Observations:
1. **Revolute 3 (Theta3)**: The current implementation assumes `theta3 = 0`, which is incorrect. Revolute 3 contributes to the positioning of the TCP, and its value must be calculated based on the target position.
2. **Revolute 4 (Theta4)**: The correct solutions show that `theta4 = 0` for all cases. This suggests that the TCP's orientation aligns with the Z-axis, and no additional rotation is required for Revolute 4.

### Plan to Fix:
1. **Recompute Theta3**: Incorporate the contribution of Revolute 3 to the TCP's position. This requires solving for the angle that aligns the third link with the target position.
2. **Set Theta4 to Zero**: Since the correct solutions consistently show `theta4 = 0`, we will set it to zero in the implementation.
3. **Refine Adjustments**: Ensure that the offsets for Revolute 4 and the TCP are correctly applied to the target position.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    tcp_offset = 0.09465  # Offset of the TCP
    link4_offset = 0.093  # Offset of Revolute 4
    adjusted_y = y - link4_offset  # Adjust for Revolute 4 offset
    adjusted_z = z - tcp_offset  # Adjust for TCP offset

    # Solve for the first three joints using the provided solution
    L1 = 0.425
    L2 = 0.39225
    d = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + adjusted_z ** 2)
    
    # Clamp cos_theta2 to the valid range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = (d ** 2 - L1 ** 2 - L2 ** 2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)
    cross_product = x * (L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2)) - adjusted_z * (L2 * math.sin(theta2))
    if cross_product < 0:
        theta2 = -theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(x, adjusted_z)
    beta = math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta2), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta2))
    theta1 = alpha - beta

    # Solve for theta3
    # Theta3 adjusts the position of the TCP along the Z-axis
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, math.sqrt(x ** 2 + adjusted_z ** 2))

    # Solve for theta4
    # Based on the feedback, theta4 is consistently zero
    theta4 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Theta3 Calculation**: Theta3 is now calculated based on the adjusted Y-coordinate and the distance to the target position in the XZ-plane. This ensures that the third joint contributes to the TCP's position.
2. **Theta4 Set to Zero**: Based on the feedback, theta4 is consistently zero, so it is explicitly set to zero in the implementation.

### Expected Behavior:
This updated implementation should now produce joint values that align with the correct solutions provided in the feedback. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
