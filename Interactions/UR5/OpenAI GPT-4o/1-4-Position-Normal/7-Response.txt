To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), \(\theta_3\), and \(\theta_4\) that position the TCP at the desired target position \(p = [x, y, z]\). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Define the problem
The robot has 4 revolute joints:
- Joint 1 (\(\theta_1\)) rotates about the Y-axis.
- Joint 2 (\(\theta_2\)) rotates about the Y-axis.
- Joint 3 (\(\theta_3\)) rotates about the Y-axis.
- Joint 4 (\(\theta_4\)) rotates about the Z-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by the cumulative transformations of these joints.

### Step 2: Use the forward kinematics
The forward kinematics equations describe the position of the TCP as a function of the joint angles. By inverting these equations, we can solve for the joint angles given the desired TCP position.

### Step 3: Solve for \(\theta_1\)
The first joint (\(\theta_1\)) determines the rotation about the Y-axis. Since the TCP position is given in Cartesian coordinates, we can use the geometry of the manipulator to compute \(\theta_1\).

### Step 4: Solve for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\)
The second and third joints (\(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\)) determine the position of the TCP in the plane defined by the first joint. Using trigonometry and the link lengths, we can compute these angles.

### Step 5: Solve for \(\theta_4\)
The fourth joint (\(\theta_4\)) determines the orientation of the TCP about the Z-axis. Since the orientation is not specified in the problem, we can assume it to be zero.

### Step 6: Implement the solution
Now, I will implement the inverse kinematics function based on the above steps.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length from base to joint 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length from joint 2 to joint 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from joint 3 to TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, -y)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3
    # Project the target position onto the YZ-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    z_offset = z - L3  # Adjust for the TCP offset
    d = np.sqrt(r**2 + z_offset**2)  # Distance to the target in the YZ-plane

    # Law of cosines to find angles
    cos_theta3 = (L1**2 + L2**2 - d**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)  # Elbow angle

    cos_theta2 = (L1**2 + d**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * d)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(z_offset, r) - np.arccos(cos_theta2)  # Shoulder angle

    # Step 3: Solve for theta4
    theta4 = 0  # Assuming no rotation about the Z-axis

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function computes the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired target position \(p = [x, y, z]\).
