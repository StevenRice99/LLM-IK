To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 4-DOF manipulator, I will now proceed step by step to compute the joint angles required to reach the target position and orientation. Let's break this down:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:  
   Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and calculating the angle using `atan2`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**:  
   Joint 2 also rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by considering the projection of the target position onto the YZ-plane and solving for the angle.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**:  
   Joint 3 rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by considering the relative position of the target with respect to the previous link.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4)**:  
   Joint 4 rotates about the Z-axis. Its angle can be determined by aligning the orientation of the TCP with the target orientation.

I will now proceed to implement the solution for the `inverse_kinematics` function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    # Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust for the offset of link 2
    d2 = 0.1197  # Offset in the Y direction
    d3 = 0.425   # Offset in the Z direction
    r2 = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    s2 = py - d2  # Adjusted Y position
    theta2 = math.atan2(s2, r2) - math.atan2(d3, math.sqrt(r2**2 + s2**2 - d3**2))

    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    # Adjust for the offset of link 3
    d4 = 0.39225  # Offset in the Z direction
    r3 = math.sqrt((r2 - d3)**2 + (s2 - d4)**2)
    theta3 = math.atan2(s2 - d4, r2 - d3)

    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    # Joint 4 rotates about the Z-axis to align the TCP orientation
    theta4 = rz  # Directly align with the target orientation in the Z-axis

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles required to reach the target position `p` and orientation `r`. It uses trigonometric relationships and the geometry of the manipulator to compute each joint angle step by step.
