To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions of each link and the TCP. The TCP position is influenced by the joint angles of the revolute joints. The revolute joints have the following axes:
- Revolute 1: Rotates about the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2: Rotates about the Y-axis.
- Revolute 3: Rotates about the Y-axis.
- Revolute 4: Rotates about the Z-axis.

The TCP position is given by:
\[
TCP = [x_{TCP}, y_{TCP}, z_{TCP}]
\]

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The inverse kinematics can be solved in the following steps:
1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \):** This is the rotation of the first joint about the Y-axis. It primarily affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.
2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \):** This is the rotation of the second joint about the Y-axis. It affects the height (Z-coordinate) of the TCP.
3. **Solve for \( \theta_3 \):** This is the rotation of the third joint about the Y-axis. It further adjusts the height and forward reach of the TCP.
4. **Solve for \( \theta_4 \):** This is the rotation of the fourth joint about the Z-axis. It adjusts the orientation of the TCP.

### Step 3: Use Geometric Relationships
The positions of the links and the TCP are given in the table. Using these, we can derive the joint angles geometrically.

### Step 4: Write the Code
Now, I will write the Python function to compute the joint angles.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from Revolute 3 to TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 1)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using geometric relationships
    # Project the target position onto the YZ-plane
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    h = y - L3  # Height adjustment for the TCP offset
    r = np.sqrt(d**2 + h**2)  # Total reach

    # Law of cosines to find angles
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = np.arccos(cos_theta3)

    sin_theta3 = np.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)  # Sine of theta3
    theta2 = np.arctan2(h, d) - np.arctan2(L2 * sin_theta3, L1 + L2 * cos_theta3)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta4 (rotation about Z-axis of Revolute 4)
    theta4 = r_z - (theta1 + theta2 + theta3)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) to position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.
