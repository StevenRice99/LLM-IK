The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values produce the desired TCP position and orientation. This provides a reference for how the joint angles influence the TCP's position and orientation.

### Observations:
1. The TCP position `[0.4512690966568878, -0.0267, 0.25439224146337086]` and orientation `[-1.0486282457603782, -0.22153998644915052, -1.6965725075385052]` are achieved with joint values:
   - \( \theta_1 = 0.095044678554922 \)
   - \( \theta_2 = 2.055084717273707 \)
   - \( \theta_3 = -1.08749341697251 \)
   - \( \theta_4 = -1.825039679542143 \)

2. The forward kinematics results for each link show how the joint angles affect the intermediate positions and orientations.

### Next Steps:
I will use this information to refine the inverse kinematics function. Specifically:
- I will ensure that the geometric relationships between the joint angles and the TCP position/orientation are correctly modeled.
- I will verify the computation of each joint angle step by step.

Let me update the inverse kinematics function accordingly.
Here is the refined inverse kinematics function, incorporating the insights from the forward kinematics results and ensuring the correct computation of joint angles:

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.425  # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from Revolute 3 to TCP
    d4 = 0.093  # Offset for Revolute 4

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 1)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Adjust for the TCP offset along the Z-axis
    z_adjusted = z - L3 * np.cos(r_y)
    x_adjusted = x - L3 * np.sin(r_y)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 and theta3 using geometric relationships
    # Project the target position onto the YZ-plane
    d = np.sqrt(x_adjusted**2 + z_adjusted**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    h = y - d4  # Height adjustment for the TCP offset
    r = np.sqrt(d**2 + h**2)  # Total reach

    # Law of cosines to find angles
    cos_theta3 = (r**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta3 = np.arccos(np.clip(cos_theta3, -1.0, 1.0))  # Clip to handle numerical errors

    sin_theta3 = np.sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2)  # Sine of theta3
    theta2 = np.arctan2(h, d) - np.arctan2(L2 * sin_theta3, L1 + L2 * cos_theta3)

    # Step 4: Solve for theta4 (rotation about Z-axis of Revolute 4)
    theta4 = r_z - (theta1 + theta2 + theta3)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

### Key Improvements:
1. **TCP Offset Adjustment**: The TCP's offset along the Z-axis is now considered when computing the effective position of the end effector.
2. **Clipping for Numerical Stability**: The cosine of \( \theta_3 \) is clipped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to handle potential numerical errors.
3. **Geometric Relationships**: The relationships between the joint angles and the TCP position are carefully modeled using the law of cosines and trigonometric identities.

This updated function should now produce joint values that correctly position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.
