To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator, I will break the problem into steps, solving for each joint angle sequentially. Here's the plan:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane will determine the angle for this joint.
2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**: This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. Using the adjusted position after accounting for Joint 1, we can solve for this angle.
3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane after accounting for Joints 1 and 2 will determine this angle.
4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4)**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. The orientation of the TCP will help determine this angle.
5. **Joint 5 (Revolute 5)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The final orientation of the TCP will determine this angle.

I will now proceed to implement the solution step by step.
