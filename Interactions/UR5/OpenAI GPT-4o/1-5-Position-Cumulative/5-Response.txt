The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the valid range for the `math.acos` function, which is [-1, 1]. This typically happens due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the inverse kinematics process.

To address this issue, I will:

1. Clamp the value of `cos_theta3` to the range [-1, 1] to ensure it is always valid for `math.acos`.
2. Revisit the calculation of `cos_theta3` to ensure it is computed correctly based on the geometry of the manipulator.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    d4 = 0.093  # Offset for joint 4
    d5 = 0.09465  # Offset for joint 5
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP offset in y-direction

    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset

    # Solve for Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Transform position to the frame after Joint 1
    x1 = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    z1 = y_adj  # Adjusted height

    # Solve for Joint 2 (Revolute 2) and Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    d = math.sqrt(x1**2 + z1**2)  # Distance to the target in the plane
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Joint 3 angle
    theta2 = math.atan2(z1, x1) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))

    # Transform position to the frame after Joint 3
    x3 = x1 - (L1 * math.cos(theta2) + L2 * math.cos(theta2 + theta3))
    z3 = z1 - (L1 * math.sin(theta2) + L2 * math.sin(theta2 + theta3))

    # Solve for Joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    theta4 = math.atan2(z3, x3)

    # Solve for Joint 5 (Revolute 5)
    theta5 = math.atan2(0, 1)  # Orientation adjustment (assume fixed orientation)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta3`**: The value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range [-1, 1] using `max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))`. This ensures that `math.acos` does not encounter a domain error.
2. **Validation of Geometry**: The calculation of `cos_theta3` is based on the geometry of the manipulator. If the target position is valid, clamping ensures numerical stability.

This should resolve the `math domain error` and allow the function to compute valid joint angles for reachable targets.
