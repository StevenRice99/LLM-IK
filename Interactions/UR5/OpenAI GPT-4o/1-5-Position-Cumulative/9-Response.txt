The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values produce the desired TCP position and orientation. However, the inverse kinematics code I provided earlier failed to compute these correct joint values. This discrepancy suggests that the approach to solving the inverse kinematics needs to be refined.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results show that the TCP position and orientation are achieved correctly with the given joint values.
2. The inverse kinematics code failed to compute these joint values due to:
   - Incorrect transformations between frames.
   - Incorrect handling of offsets and orientations.
   - Lack of consideration for the orientation of the TCP in the final joint calculations.

### Plan for Refinement:
1. **Revisit the Frame Transformations**:
   - Ensure that the transformations between frames are correctly applied, including offsets and rotations.
   - Account for the orientation of the TCP in the final joint calculations.

2. **Incorporate Orientation Constraints**:
   - The orientation of the TCP must be considered when solving for the last two joints (Revolute 4 and Revolute 5).

3. **Iterative Debugging**:
   - Use the provided forward kinematics results to verify each step of the inverse kinematics calculations.

I will now refine the inverse kinematics code to address these issues.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.425  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    d4 = 0.093  # Offset for joint 4
    d5 = 0.09465  # Offset for joint 5
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP offset in y-direction

    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y_adj = y - tcp_offset

    # Solve for Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Transform position to the frame after Joint 1
    x1 = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    z1 = y_adj  # Adjusted height

    # Solve for Joint 2 (Revolute 2) and Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    d = math.sqrt(x1**2 + z1**2)  # Distance to the target in the plane
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to valid range
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)  # Joint 3 angle
    theta2 = math.atan2(z1, x1) - math.atan2(L2 * math.sin(theta3), L1 + L2 * math.cos(theta3))

    # Transform position to the frame after Joint 3
    x3 = x1 - (L1 * math.cos(theta2) + L2 * math.cos(theta2 + theta3))
    z3 = z1 - (L1 * math.sin(theta2) + L2 * math.sin(theta2 + theta3))

    # Solve for Joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    theta4 = math.atan2(z3, x3)

    # Solve for Joint 5 (Revolute 5)
    theta5 = 0  # Orientation adjustment (assume fixed orientation)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5)
```

### Next Steps:
1. Test the refined code with the provided test cases.
2. Verify that the computed joint values match the correct joint values for each test case.
3. If the code still fails, further refine the transformations and orientation handling.
