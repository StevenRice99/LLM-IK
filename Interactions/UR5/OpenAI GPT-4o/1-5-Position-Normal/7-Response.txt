The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is failing to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions. The primary issue seems to be that the computed joint angles are not producing the desired TCP positions, and the third joint angle (\(\theta_3\)) is consistently being set to \(\pi\) (3.14159), which is incorrect.

### Observations from Feedback:
1. The computed joint angles are significantly different from the correct joint angles provided by the working inverse kinematics solver.
2. The TCP positions reached by the computed joint angles are far from the target positions.
3. The third joint angle (\(\theta_3\)) is consistently being set to \(\pi\), which suggests an error in the calculation of \(\theta_3\) or the geometric relationships.

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(\theta_3\)**:
   - The law of cosines is used to compute \(\theta_3\), but the implementation may not correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator. This could lead to incorrect values for \(\theta_3\), which in turn affects the other joint angles.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of \(\theta_2\)**:
   - The calculation of \(\theta_2\) depends on the value of \(\theta_3\). If \(\theta_3\) is incorrect, \(\theta_2\) will also be incorrect.

3. **Simplistic Assumptions for \(\theta_4\) and \(\theta_5\)**:
   - The current implementation assumes \(\theta_4 = 0\) and \(\theta_5 = 0\), which is overly simplistic and does not account for the orientation of the TCP.

4. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - The geometric relationships used to compute the joint angles may not fully capture the kinematics of the manipulator.

### Plan to Fix the Issues:
1. **Revisit the Geometric Relationships**:
   - Carefully derive the equations for \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), \(\theta_3\), \(\theta_4\), and \(\theta_5\) based on the manipulator's kinematics.

2. **Account for Orientation**:
   - Incorporate the orientation of the TCP into the calculations for \(\theta_4\) and \(\theta_5\).

3. **Validate the Law of Cosines**:
   - Ensure that the law of cosines is applied correctly and that the computed values are clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid invalid inputs to the square root function.

4. **Iterative Testing**:
   - Test the updated implementation on various target positions to ensure that the computed joint angles produce the correct TCP positions.

### Updated Implementation:
Here is the revised implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Matrix, cos, sin, atan2, sqrt, pi

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.425  # Distance from base to second joint
    d2 = 0.39225  # Distance from second to third joint
    d3 = 0.093  # Distance from third to fourth joint
    d4 = 0.09465  # Distance from fourth to fifth joint
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP offset along Y-axis

    # Adjust target position to account for TCP offset
    y -= tcp_offset

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis of the base)
    theta1 = atan2(x, z)

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using geometric relationships
    r = sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Projection of the target on the XZ plane
    s = y - d1  # Vertical offset from the base to the target
    d = sqrt(r**2 + s**2)  # Distance from the second joint to the target

    # Law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (d2**2 + d3**2 - d**2) / (2 * d2 * d3)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    theta3 = atan2(sqrt(1 - cos_theta3**2), cos_theta3)  # Elbow up solution

    # Law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (d2**2 + d**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * d)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    theta2 = atan2(s, r) - atan2(sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2), cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta4 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Incorporate the orientation of the TCP
    theta4 = 0  # Placeholder for now

    # Solve for theta5 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Incorporate the orientation of the TCP
    theta5 = 0  # Placeholder for now

    # Return the computed joint angles
    return float(theta1), float(theta2), float(theta3), float(theta4), float(theta5)
```

### Next Steps:
1. **Test the Updated Implementation**:
   - Test the updated function on various target positions to verify that it produces the correct joint angles.

2. **Incorporate Orientation**:
   - Update the calculations for \(\theta_4\) and \(\theta_5\) to account for the orientation of the TCP.

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Refine the implementation based on the results of the tests and feedback.

If the updated implementation still fails to produce the correct results, I will analyze the specific cases and further refine the geometric relationships and calculations.
