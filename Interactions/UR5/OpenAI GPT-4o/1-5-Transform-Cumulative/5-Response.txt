Using the forward kinematics data provided, I can now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics data shows the positions and orientations of each link in the chain. The TCP (Tool Center Point) position is `[0, 0.0556, 0.9119]` and its orientation is `[0, 0, 1.570796325]`. This matches the target position and orientation provided in the DETAILS section.

### Step 2: Solve for Each Joint
The inverse kinematics problem involves solving for the joint angles (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`, `theta4`, `theta5`) that achieve the target position and orientation. Using the existing solutions for sub-chains, I will extend them to solve for the entire chain.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Adjust position for joint 2
    d1 = 0.425  # Link offset for Revolute 2
    adjusted_py = py + 0.1197  # Adjust for link offset
    adjusted_pz = pz - d1

    # Solve for joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_py, adjusted_pz)

    # Solve for joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    d2 = 0.39225  # Link offset for Revolute 3
    adjusted_pz_3 = adjusted_pz - d2
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_py, adjusted_pz_3)

    # Solve for joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    theta4 = math.atan2(py, px)

    # Solve for joint 5 (Revolute 5)
    theta5 = yaw - theta4  # Adjust for orientation

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Joint 1 (`theta1`)**: Solved using the `atan2` function based on the x and z coordinates of the target position.
2. **Joint 2 (`theta2`)**: Adjusted the target position to account for the link offset and solved using `atan2`.
3. **Joint 3 (`theta3`)**: Further adjusted the position for the next link offset and solved using `atan2`.
4. **Joint 4 (`theta4`)**: Solved based on the orientation of the TCP.
5. **Joint 5 (`theta5`)**: Solved by adjusting the yaw angle to account for the orientation of the previous joint.

This function should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target position and orientation.
