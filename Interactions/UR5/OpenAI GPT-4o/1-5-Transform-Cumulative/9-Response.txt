The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values `[-0.8801045213462261, -0.782291394357944, 0.7309611307395381, 2.052116292323732, -1.895363978448967]` produce the desired target position and orientation. This indicates that the issue lies in the inverse kinematics function I provided earlier, as it failed to compute the correct joint values.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results match the target position and orientation when the correct joint values are used.
2. The inverse kinematics function I provided earlier failed to compute the correct joint values, leading to incorrect positions and orientations.

### Next Steps:
To address this, I will analyze the forward kinematics results and the provided feedback to refine the inverse kinematics function. Specifically:
- I will ensure that the transformations between links are correctly accounted for.
- I will verify the computation of each joint angle step by step, ensuring consistency with the forward kinematics.

Let me refine the inverse kinematics function.
To refine the inverse kinematics function, I will carefully analyze the forward kinematics and the provided feedback. The goal is to compute the joint angles step by step, ensuring that the transformations between links are correctly accounted for.

### Step-by-Step Refinement:
1. **Joint 1 (`theta1`)**:
   - This joint rotates about the Y-axis and primarily affects the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
   - From the forward kinematics, the position of Revolute 1 is `[0, 0, 0]`, and the target position is `[-0.837680042810078, -0.064800750075408, 0.232811098615703]`.
   - Using the `atan2` function, `theta1` can be computed as:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(-x, z)
     \]

2. **Joint 2 (`theta2`)**:
   - This joint also rotates about the Y-axis and affects the position of Revolute 2.
   - The position of Revolute 2 is `[-0.3275923249982591, -0.1197, 0.2707549973725969]`.
   - The target position is adjusted to account for the offset introduced by Revolute 1.

3. **Joint 3 (`theta3`)**:
   - This joint rotates about the Y-axis and affects the position of Revolute 3.
   - The position of Revolute 3 is `[-0.718197891470814, -0.1197, 0.2348752824816664]`.
   - The target position is further adjusted to account for the offsets introduced by Revolute 2.

4. **Joint 4 (`theta4`)**:
   - This joint rotates about the Z-axis and affects the orientation of Revolute 4.
   - The orientation of Revolute 4 is `[-0.8728057217475818, 0.38063094349150584, 1.8728988927889927]`.
   - The target orientation is adjusted to account for the rotations introduced by Revolute 3.

5. **Joint 5 (`theta5`)**:
   - This joint rotates about the Y-axis and affects the orientation of Revolute 5.
   - The orientation of Revolute 5 is `[-1.3470951726636655, -0.7532355659508754, -2.74368359729436]`.
   - The target orientation is further adjusted to account for the rotations introduced by Revolute 4.

### Updated Inverse Kinematics Function:
Here is the refined Python function:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(-px, pz)

    # Adjust position for joint 2
    d1 = 0.425  # Link offset for Revolute 2
    adjusted_py = py + 0.1197  # Adjust for link offset
    adjusted_pz = pz - d1

    # Solve for joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_py, adjusted_pz)

    # Solve for joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    d2 = 0.39225  # Link offset for Revolute 3
    adjusted_pz_3 = adjusted_pz - d2
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_py, adjusted_pz_3)

    # Solve for joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    theta4 = math.atan2(py, px)

    # Solve for joint 5 (Revolute 5)
    theta5 = yaw - theta4  # Adjust for orientation

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Joint 1**: Corrected the computation of `theta1` using the `atan2` function.
2. **Joint 2**: Adjusted the target position to account for the offset introduced by Revolute 1.
3. **Joint 3**: Further adjusted the position for the next link offset.
4. **Joint 4**: Corrected the computation of `theta4` based on the target orientation.
5. **Joint 5**: Adjusted the computation of `theta5` to account for the orientation of the previous joint.

This refined function should now compute the correct joint angles for the given target position and orientation.
