The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values produce the desired position and orientation for the TCP. This indicates that the issue lies in the inverse kinematics implementation, which fails to compute the correct joint values to match the target position and orientation.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values match the target position and orientation perfectly.
2. The inverse kinematics implementation is producing incorrect joint values, leading to significant errors in both position and orientation.

### Key Issues in the Current Inverse Kinematics Implementation:
1. **Incorrect Joint Angle Calculations**:
   - The computation of `theta2` and `theta3` may not correctly account for the manipulator's geometry and constraints.
   - The use of `math.acos` and `math.atan2` might not be properly aligned with the manipulator's kinematic chain.

2. **Orientation Handling**:
   - The computation of `theta4` and `theta5` relies on the effective rotation matrix, but the decomposition of this matrix might not be accurate.

3. **Numerical Stability**:
   - While clamping values for `math.acos` ensures numerical stability, it might mask underlying issues in the geometric calculations.

### Plan to Fix the Inverse Kinematics:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - Carefully analyze the manipulator's kinematic chain to ensure the calculations for `theta2` and `theta3` are consistent with the link lengths and offsets.

2. **Improve Orientation Handling**:
   - Use a more robust method to compute `theta4` and `theta5` from the target orientation, ensuring the decomposition of the rotation matrix is accurate.

3. **Test Incrementally**:
   - Validate each joint angle calculation independently using forward kinematics to ensure correctness.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics implementation to address these issues.
Here is the revised implementation of the inverse kinematics function, addressing the issues identified earlier:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d2 = 0.1197  # Offset for Revolute 2
    d3 = 0.39225  # Offset for Revolute 3
    l2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3
    d4 = 0.093  # Offset for Revolute 4
    d5 = 0.09465  # Offset for Revolute 5

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (theta1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (theta2) and Joint 3 (theta3)
    # Compute the wrist center position
    wx = px - d5 * math.cos(yaw) * math.cos(pitch)
    wy = py - d5 * math.sin(yaw) * math.cos(pitch)
    wz = pz - d5 * math.sin(pitch)

    # Compute the distance from the base to the wrist center
    r = math.sqrt(wx**2 + wy**2)
    s = wz - d2

    # Compute theta2 and theta3 using the law of cosines
    D = (r**2 + s**2 - l2**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    D = max(-1, min(1, D))  # Clamp to avoid numerical errors
    theta3 = math.acos(D)

    phi2 = math.atan2(s, r)
    phi1 = math.atan2(l3 * math.sin(theta3), l2 + l3 * math.cos(theta3))
    theta2 = phi2 - phi1

    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 4 (theta4) and Joint 5 (theta5)
    # Compute the rotation matrix for the target orientation
    R_target = np.array([
        [math.cos(yaw) * math.cos(pitch), math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.sin(roll) - math.sin(yaw) * math.cos(roll), math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.cos(roll) + math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(roll)],
        [math.sin(yaw) * math.cos(pitch), math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.sin(roll) + math.cos(yaw) * math.cos(roll), math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.cos(roll) - math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(roll)],
        [-math.sin(pitch), math.cos(pitch) * math.sin(roll), math.cos(pitch) * math.cos(roll)]
    ])

    # Compute the rotation matrix for Joint 1
    R_theta1 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta1), -math.sin(theta1), 0],
        [math.sin(theta1), math.cos(theta1), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])

    # Compute the rotation matrix for Joint 2
    R_theta2 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta2), 0, math.sin(theta2)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(theta2), 0, math.cos(theta2)]
    ])

    # Compute the rotation matrix for Joint 3
    R_theta3 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta3), 0, math.sin(theta3)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(theta3), 0, math.cos(theta3)]
    ])

    # Compute the effective rotation matrix for Joints 4 and 5
    R_effective = np.linalg.inv(R_theta1 @ R_theta2 @ R_theta3) @ R_target

    # Solve for Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(R_effective[1, 0], R_effective[0, 0])

    # Solve for Joint 5
    theta5 = math.atan2(-R_effective[2, 0], math.sqrt(R_effective[2, 1]**2 + R_effective[2, 2]**2))

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Wrist Center Calculation**:
   - The wrist center position is computed by subtracting the contribution of the end-effector orientation from the target position.

2. **Theta2 and Theta3 Calculation**:
   - The law of cosines is used to compute `theta3`, and `theta2` is computed using the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Rotation Matrix Decomposition**:
   - The effective rotation matrix for Joints 4 and 5 is computed by removing the contributions of Joints 1, 2, and 3 from the target orientation.

4. **Numerical Stability**:
   - Clamping is applied to the argument of `math.acos` to ensure it remains within the valid range.

This implementation should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target position and orientation. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
