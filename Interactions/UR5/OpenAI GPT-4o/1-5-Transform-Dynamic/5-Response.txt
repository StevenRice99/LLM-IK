To solve the inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF manipulator, I will now proceed step by step to compute the joint angles required to reach the target position and orientation. Let's break this down:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined based on the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**: This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by considering the position of the second link relative to the first.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by considering the position of the third link relative to the second.

4. **Joints 4 and 5 (Revolute 4 and 5)**: These joints are responsible for the orientation of the TCP. Their angles can be determined by solving for the rotation matrix that aligns the TCP with the target orientation.

I will now proceed to compute the solution for the inverse kinematics.
