The error indicates that the argument passed to the `math.acos` function is outside the valid range of [-1, 1]. This typically happens when the computed value for the cosine of an angle is slightly outside this range due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations.

To address this issue, I will:

1. Clamp the argument of `math.acos` to the range [-1, 1] to ensure numerical stability.
2. Revisit the calculation of `yz_distance` and the arguments passed to `math.acos` to ensure they are physically valid and consistent with the manipulator's geometry.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for Joint 2
    d2 = 0.1197  # Offset for Revolute 2
    d3 = 0.39225  # Offset for Revolute 3
    l2 = 0.425  # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.39225  # Length of link 3

    # Project the target position onto the YZ-plane
    yz_distance = math.sqrt(py**2 + (pz - d2)**2)

    # Clamp the argument of acos to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta2 = (l2**2 + yz_distance**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * yz_distance)
    cos_theta2 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta2))  # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1]
    theta2 = math.atan2(py, pz - d2) - math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 3
    cos_theta3 = (l2**2 + l3**2 - yz_distance**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))  # Ensure the value is within [-1, 1]
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Step 4: Solve for Joints 4 and 5
    # Compute the rotation matrix for the target orientation
    R_target = np.array([
        [math.cos(yaw) * math.cos(pitch), math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.sin(roll) - math.sin(yaw) * math.cos(roll), math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.cos(roll) + math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(roll)],
        [math.sin(yaw) * math.cos(pitch), math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.sin(roll) + math.cos(yaw) * math.cos(roll), math.sin(yaw) * math.sin(pitch) * math.cos(roll) - math.cos(yaw) * math.sin(roll)],
        [-math.sin(pitch), math.cos(pitch) * math.sin(roll), math.cos(pitch) * math.cos(roll)]
    ])

    # Compute the rotation matrix for Joint 1
    R_theta1 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta1), -math.sin(theta1), 0],
        [math.sin(theta1), math.cos(theta1), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])

    # Compute the rotation matrix for Joint 2
    R_theta2 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta2), 0, math.sin(theta2)],
        [0, 1, 0],
        [-math.sin(theta2), 0, math.cos(theta2)]
    ])

    # Compute the effective rotation matrix for Joints 4 and 5
    R_effective = np.linalg.inv(R_theta1 @ R_theta2) @ R_target

    # Solve for Joint 4
    theta4 = math.atan2(R_effective[1, 0], R_effective[0, 0])

    # Solve for Joint 5
    theta5 = math.atan2(-R_effective[2, 0], math.sqrt(R_effective[2, 1]**2 + R_effective[2, 2]**2))

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5
```

### Key Fixes:
1. **Clamping `cos_theta2` and `cos_theta3**`: Ensures that the arguments to `math.acos` are always within the valid range [-1, 1].
2. **Numerical Stability**: This fix prevents the `math domain error` caused by floating-point inaccuracies.

This should resolve the issue. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
