The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function fails to compute the correct joint angles for various target positions and orientations. The primary issues seem to be:

1. **Incorrect Joint Angle Calculations**:
   - The computed joint angles do not align with the correct values provided in the feedback.
   - The solution does not account for the full kinematic chain, particularly the orientation of the TCP.

2. **Oversimplified Orientation Handling**:
   - The current implementation directly assigns the TCP orientation to the last two joints (\( \theta_4 \) and \( \theta_5 \)), which is incorrect. The orientation of the TCP depends on the combined effects of all joints.

3. **Lack of Proper Forward Kinematics Validation**:
   - The computed joint angles do not produce the desired TCP position and orientation, indicating a mismatch in the kinematic model.

### Plan to Fix the Issues:
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Model**:
   - Use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters or transformation matrices to compute the forward kinematics and ensure consistency with the inverse kinematics calculations.

2. **Account for Orientation Properly**:
   - Use the target orientation to compute the last two joint angles (\( \theta_4 \) and \( \theta_5 \)) based on the relative orientation of the wrist center and the TCP.

3. **Iterative Testing and Validation**:
   - Test the updated implementation against the provided correct joint values and ensure that the computed TCP position and orientation match the target.

4. **Use SymPy for Symbolic Computation**:
   - Leverage symbolic computation to derive the inverse kinematics equations systematically.

I will now revise the implementation to address these issues.

### Key Updates:
1. **Wrist Center Calculation**:
   - Adjusted to account for the full orientation of the TCP.

2. **Orientation Handling**:
   - Used rotation matrices to compute the relative orientation of the wrist center and the TCP.

3. **Validation**:
   - Ensured that the computed joint angles align with the target position and orientation.

This updated implementation should address the issues. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
