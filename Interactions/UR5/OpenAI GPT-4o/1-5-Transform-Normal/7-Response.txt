The forward kinematics results confirm the default configuration of the robot when all joint angles are set to zero. Using this information, I will now proceed to derive the inverse kinematics solution for the given manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Inverse Kinematics:
1. **Understand the Target**: The target position `p` and orientation `r` are given. The goal is to compute the joint angles `[θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5]` that achieve this target.

2. **Decompose the Problem**:
   - Use the position of the TCP to determine the first three joint angles `[θ1, θ2, θ3]` by solving for the position of the wrist center (end of Revolute 3).
   - Use the orientation of the TCP to determine the last two joint angles `[θ4, θ5]`.

3. **Geometric Approach**:
   - Compute the wrist center position by subtracting the contribution of the last two links (Revolute 4 and Revolute 5) from the TCP position.
   - Solve for the angles of the first three joints using the wrist center position.
   - Solve for the last two joint angles using the orientation of the TCP.

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Use trigonometric relationships and the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of the manipulator to compute the joint angles.

I will now proceed to implement the inverse kinematics function.
