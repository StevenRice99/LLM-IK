To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis and affects the position of Revolute 2 and the TCP.
   - Revolute 2 also rotates about the Y-axis and directly affects the TCP's position.

2. **TCP Position**:
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Y-axis (0.093 m).

3. **Plan**:
   - Use the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) to calculate the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using trigonometric relationships.

Now, I will proceed to implement the solution in the provided Python function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Length of the second link (distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis)
    l2 = 0.39225

    # Offset of the TCP along the Y-axis
    offset_y = 0.093

    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y - offset_y

    # Calculate joint angles using trigonometry
    # Joint 2 (Revolute 2) affects the Z-axis position
    theta2 = math.atan2(z, y_adjusted)

    # Joint 1 (Revolute 1) affects the X-axis position
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, math.sqrt(y_adjusted**2 + z**2))

    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position \( p \). It uses trigonometric relationships to determine the angles required to position the TCP at the desired location.
