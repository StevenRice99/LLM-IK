To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Analyze the Kinematic Chain
- **Revolute 1**: Rotates about the Y-axis at the base.
- **Revolute 2**: Rotates about the Y-axis at a position offset by \( [0, 0, 0.39225] \) from Revolute 1.
- **TCP**: Offset by \( [0, 0.093, 0] \) from Revolute 2.

### Step 2: Geometry of the Manipulator
The TCP position is determined by the combined rotations of the two revolute joints and the fixed offsets. The forward kinematics equation can be expressed as:
\[
z_{TCP} = 0.39225 \cos(\theta_1) + 0.093 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
y_{TCP} = 0.39225 \sin(\theta_1) + 0.093 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

Given the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \), we solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
From the geometry, the distance from Revolute 1 to the TCP in the \( z \)-direction is:
\[
z_{TCP} = 0.39225 + 0.093 \cos(\theta_2)
\]
Rearranging for \( \cos(\theta_2) \):
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{z_{TCP} - 0.39225}{0.093}
\]

Similarly, the distance in the \( y \)-direction is:
\[
y_{TCP} = 0.093 \sin(\theta_2)
\]
Rearranging for \( \sin(\theta_2) \):
\[
\sin(\theta_2) = \frac{y_{TCP}}{0.093}
\]

Using \( \cos(\theta_2) \) and \( \sin(\theta_2) \), we can compute \( \theta_2 \) using:
\[
\theta_2 = \arctan2(\sin(\theta_2), \cos(\theta_2))
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
Once \( \theta_2 \) is known, we can compute \( \theta_1 \) using the forward kinematics equations:
\[
z_{TCP} = 0.39225 \cos(\theta_1) + 0.093 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]
\[
y_{TCP} = 0.39225 \sin(\theta_1) + 0.093 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
\]

Rearranging for \( \theta_1 \), we solve:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y_{TCP}, z_{TCP})
\]

### Step 5: Implement the Solution
Here is the Python implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta_2
    cos_theta2 = (z - 0.39225) / 0.093
    sin_theta2 = y / 0.093
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta_1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, z)

    return theta1, theta2
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
