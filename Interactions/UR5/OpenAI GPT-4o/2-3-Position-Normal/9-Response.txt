The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the issue lies in the incorrect computation of the joint angles, particularly for the second joint. The second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) should be zero for all the provided test cases, but the current implementation incorrectly sets it to \(-\pi/2\). This suggests that the computation for \( \theta_2 \) is flawed.

### Observations:
1. The TCP's position is directly influenced by the second joint's rotation about the Y-axis. The feedback shows that the TCP's Z-coordinate is flipped in sign, which indicates an incorrect rotation applied by the second joint.
2. The first joint (\( \theta_1 \)) affects the X-coordinate of the TCP. The feedback shows that the computed \( \theta_1 \) values are incorrect, likely due to an incorrect trigonometric relationship.

### Plan:
1. Correct the computation of \( \theta_2 \) to ensure it aligns the TCP's Z-coordinate with the target position.
2. Recompute \( \theta_1 \) based on the corrected \( \theta_2 \) to ensure the TCP's X-coordinate matches the target position.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Length of the second link (distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis)
    l2 = 0.39225

    # Offset of the TCP along the Y-axis
    offset_y = 0.093

    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    y_adjusted = y - offset_y

    # Compute the second joint angle (theta2)
    # The second joint affects the Z-coordinate of the TCP
    theta2 = math.atan2(-z, y_adjusted)

    # Compute the first joint angle (theta1)
    # The first joint affects the X-coordinate of the TCP
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, -z)

    return theta1, theta2
```

This revised function adjusts the computation of \( \theta_2 \) to correctly align the TCP's Z-coordinate with the target position. It also recomputes \( \theta_1 \) based on the corrected \( \theta_2 \).
