It seems there is a repetitive loop in the responses. Let me proceed with solving the inverse kinematics problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP (Tool Center Point) position is given as `[x, y, z]`.
   - The goal is to compute the joint angles (`theta1` and `theta2`) that position the TCP at the desired location.

2. **Kinematic Chain**:
   - Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis and affects the position of Joint 2 and the TCP.
   - Joint 2 also rotates about the Y-axis and directly affects the TCP position.

3. **Approach**:
   - Use the provided forward kinematics to compute the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP position.
   - Solve for `theta1` and `theta2` using trigonometric relationships.

4. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The TCP position can be expressed as:
     \[
     x_{TCP} = L_2 \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z_{TCP} = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2)
     \]
     where:
     - \( L_1 = 0.39225 \) (length of the first link),
     - \( L_2 = 0.093 \) (length of the second link).

   - Solve these equations to find `theta1` and `theta2`.

Let me now proceed to implement the solution in the provided Python function.

### Implementation:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link
    
    # Compute theta2 using the law of cosines
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance from the base to the TCP in the XZ plane
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)  # Joint 2 angle
    
    # Compute theta1 using trigonometry
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # Sine of theta2
    k1 = L1 + L2 * cos_theta2
    k2 = L2 * sin_theta2
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z) - math.atan2(k2, k1)  # Joint 1 angle
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Theta2 Calculation**:
   - Use the law of cosines to compute the angle of the second joint based on the distance `d` and the link lengths.

2. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - Use trigonometry to compute the angle of the first joint, considering the projection of the TCP in the XZ plane.

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns the computed joint angles `theta1` and `theta2` in radians.

This solution assumes that the target position is always reachable, as stated in the instructions.
