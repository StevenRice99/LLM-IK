To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [0, 0, 0] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics provided:
- Revolute 1 contributes rotation about the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2 contributes rotation about the Y-axis and a translation along the Z-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by:
1. The rotation of Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \)).
2. The rotation of Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \)) and its offset along the Z-axis.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The TCP position can be expressed as:
\[
p_{TCP} = [x, y, z] = R_y(\theta_1) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0.39225 \end{bmatrix} + R_y(\theta_1 + \theta_2) \cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0.093 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}
\]
Where \( R_y(\theta) \) is the rotation matrix about the Y-axis:
\[
R_y(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & 0 & \sin\theta \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-\sin\theta & 0 & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)
1. Use the projection of the TCP position onto the XZ-plane to solve for \( \theta_1 \).
2. Use the remaining components to solve for \( \theta_2 \).

Let me now complete the Python function for the inverse kinematics.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 using the projection onto the XZ-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Compute the effective position of the TCP in the local frame of link 2
    # Rotate the target position back by -theta1 to align with link 2's frame
    x_prime = math.cos(-theta1) * x - math.sin(-theta1) * z
    z_prime = math.sin(-theta1) * x + math.cos(-theta1) * z

    # Subtract the contribution of link 2's offset along the Z-axis
    z_prime -= 0.39225

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 using the remaining position
    theta2 = math.atan2(x_prime, z_prime)

    return theta1, theta2
``` 

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) is determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and using the `atan2` function.

2. **Transform to Link 2's Frame**:
   - The target position is rotated back by \( -\theta_1 \) to align it with the local frame of link 2.
   - The offset of link 2 along the Z-axis is subtracted to isolate the contribution of \( \theta_2 \).

3. **Theta2 Calculation**:
   - The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is determined by the remaining position in the local frame of link 2.

This solution assumes the orientation \( r \) is always \( [0, 0, 0] \), as specified in the problem. The function returns the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) in radians.
