The forward kinematics results provide the position and orientation of each link when the correct joint values are applied. This information is crucial for understanding the relationship between the joint angles and the resulting end-effector position and orientation.

### Observations from Forward Kinematics:
1. **Revolute 1:**
   - Position: \([0, 0, 0]\) (base of the manipulator).
   - Orientation: \([3.141592653589793, 0.6448661297392131, 3.141592653589793]\).

2. **Revolute 2:**
   - Position: \([0.23577812417811483, 0, -0.31347845007121217]\).
   - Orientation: \([0, -0.9551245097862909, 0]\).

3. **TCP:**
   - Position: \([0.23577812417811483, 0.093, -0.31347845007121217]\).
   - Orientation: \([0, -0.9551245097862909, 0]\).

### Key Insights:
- The TCP position matches the target position \([0.23577812417811503, 0.093, -0.313478450071212]\), confirming that the forward kinematics are consistent with the correct joint values.
- The orientation of the TCP is also consistent with the target orientation \([0, -0.95512450978629, 0]\).

### Adjustments to the Inverse Kinematics:
The inverse kinematics solution must account for the orientation of the links, which was not considered in the previous implementation. Specifically:
1. **Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \)):**
   - The orientation of Revolute 1 affects the global orientation of the manipulator. This must be incorporated into the calculation of \( \theta_1 \).

2. **Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \)):**
   - The orientation of Revolute 2 determines the final orientation of the TCP. This must be incorporated into the calculation of \( \theta_2 \).

### Next Steps:
I will revise the inverse kinematics function to include the orientation constraints. This will involve solving for the joint angles that not only position the TCP correctly but also achieve the desired orientation.
Here is the revised implementation of the inverse kinematics function, incorporating both position and orientation constraints:

### Revised Approach
1. **Position Constraints:**
   - The TCP position is adjusted for the offset, as before.
   - The joint angles are calculated to match the target position.

2. **Orientation Constraints:**
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the combined rotations of Revolute 1 and Revolute 2.
   - The desired orientation is used to solve for the joint angles.

### Implementation

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Adjust for TCP offset
    z_prime = z - 0.093  # Adjusted Z position
    
    # Solve for theta_1 (Revolute 1)
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z_prime)
    
    # Solve for theta_2 (Revolute 2)
    link_length = 0.39225
    cos_theta_2 = z_prime / link_length
    
    # Clamp the value to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta_2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta_2))
    
    theta_2 = math.acos(cos_theta_2)
    
    # Adjust theta_2 based on the desired orientation
    # The orientation of the TCP is determined by the sum of the joint angles
    # ry (target orientation about Y-axis) = theta_1 + theta_2
    theta_2 = ry - theta_1
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Orientation Constraint:**
   - The desired orientation about the Y-axis (\( ry \)) is the sum of the joint angles (\( \theta_1 + \theta_2 \)).
   - This relationship is used to adjust \( \theta_2 \) after solving for the position.

2. **Clamping:**
   - The clamping of \( \cos(\theta_2) \) ensures numerical stability.

3. **TCP Offset:**
   - The TCP offset is still accounted for in the position calculation.

### Expected Behavior
This implementation should now correctly compute the joint angles to achieve both the target position and orientation. If further adjustments are needed, I will refine the approach based on additional feedback.
