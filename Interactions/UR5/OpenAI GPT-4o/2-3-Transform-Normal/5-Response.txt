To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = [x, y, z] \). Here's the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Analyze the Geometry
- The manipulator consists of two revolute joints, both rotating about the Y-axis.
- The TCP is offset by \( [0, 0.093, 0] \) relative to the end of Revolute 2.
- The second link has a length of \( 0.39225 \) along the Z-axis.

### Step 2: Define the Target Position
The target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) is given in the global frame. To compute the joint angles, we need to account for the TCP offset:
\[
p' = [x, y, z - 0.093]
\]
This adjusted position \( p' \) represents the position of the end of Revolute 2.

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles
Using the geometry of the manipulator:
1. **Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \)):**
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis, so it determines the X and Z position of the end of Revolute 2.
   - Using the projection onto the XZ-plane:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z')
     \]
     where \( z' = z - 0.093 \).

2. **Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \)):**
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis and determines the extension along the Z-axis.
   - The length of the second link is \( 0.39225 \), so:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{z'}{0.39225}
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{z'}{0.39225}\right)
     \]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
Here is the Python implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust for TCP offset
    z_prime = z - 0.093  # Adjusted Z position
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z_prime)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    link_length = 0.39225
    theta_2 = math.acos(z_prime / link_length)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \). Note that the orientation \( r \) is not used because the manipulator's orientation is fixed in this configuration.
