The error occurs because the argument passed to `math.acos` is outside the valid range of \([-1, 1]\). This happens when the value of \( z' / \text{link\_length} \) is either less than -1 or greater than 1, which is mathematically invalid for the `acos` function.

### Root Cause
The issue arises because the calculation of \( z' \) (adjusted \( z \)-coordinate) and the link length does not account for numerical precision or edge cases where the target position might be slightly outside the reachable workspace due to floating-point inaccuracies.

### Solution
To fix this, we need to:
1. Clamp the value of \( z' / \text{link\_length} \) to the range \([-1, 1]\) before passing it to `math.acos`.
2. Ensure that the input position \( p \) is adjusted correctly for the TCP offset.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Adjust for TCP offset
    z_prime = z - 0.093  # Adjusted Z position
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z_prime)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    link_length = 0.39225
    cos_theta_2 = z_prime / link_length
    
    # Clamp the value to the range [-1, 1] to avoid math domain errors
    cos_theta_2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta_2))
    
    theta_2 = math.acos(cos_theta_2)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

### Explanation of Fixes
1. **Clamping `cos_theta_2`:**
   - The value of \( \cos(\theta_2) \) is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_theta_2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, cos_theta_2))
     ```
   - This ensures that even if \( z' / \text{link\_length} \) slightly exceeds the valid range due to numerical inaccuracies, the function will not throw a `ValueError`.

2. **Preserving the TCP Offset Adjustment:**
   - The adjustment \( z' = z - 0.093 \) ensures that the TCP offset is correctly accounted for.

3. **No Changes to \( \theta_1 \):**
   - The calculation of \( \theta_1 \) using `atan2` is robust and does not require clamping.

### Expected Behavior
This corrected implementation should now handle all valid inputs without encountering a `ValueError`. If the target position is within the reachable workspace, the function will return the correct joint angles. If the target position is slightly outside the workspace due to floating-point inaccuracies, the clamping will ensure a valid result.
