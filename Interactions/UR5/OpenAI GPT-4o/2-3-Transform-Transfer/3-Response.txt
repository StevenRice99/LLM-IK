To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to consider the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The provided forward kinematics results show how the orientation of the TCP is affected by the joint angles.

### Analysis:
1. **Position**: The existing solution already calculates the joint angles (`theta1` and `theta2`) required to reach a specific position `p`. This part of the solution remains valid.
2. **Orientation**: The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the rotation of both joints. Since both joints rotate about the Y-axis, the cumulative rotation about the Y-axis determines the final orientation of the TCP.

The orientation of the TCP in the Y-axis (`r[1]`) is the sum of the rotations caused by `theta1` and `theta2`. Therefore:
\[ r[1] = \theta1 + \theta2 \]

### Steps to Solve:
1. Use the existing position-based inverse kinematics solution to calculate `theta1` and `theta2` for the given position `p`.
2. Adjust `theta2` to account for the desired orientation `r[1]`:
   \[ \theta2 = r[1] - \theta1 \]

### Updated Code:
Here is the completed `inverse_kinematics` function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Step 1: Solve for position
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Step 2: Adjust for orientation
    theta2 = r[1] - theta1
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation:
- The first part of the function calculates `theta1` and `theta2` based on the position `p` using the existing solution.
- The second part adjusts `theta2` to ensure the desired orientation `r[1]` is achieved.

This solution ensures that both the position and orientation of the TCP are satisfied.
