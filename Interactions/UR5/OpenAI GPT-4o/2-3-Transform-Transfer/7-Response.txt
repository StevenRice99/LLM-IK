The feedback indicates that the current implementation fails to account for the full orientation of the TCP, particularly the rotations about the X and Z axes. The correct joint values provided in the feedback suggest that the orientation adjustment for `theta2` is incorrect and that the cumulative rotation about the Y-axis is not being handled properly.

### Observations:
1. The TCP's orientation in the feedback is given as `[3.141592653589793, r_y, 3.141592653589793]`. This indicates that the TCP's orientation includes rotations about the X and Z axes, which are not being addressed in the current implementation.
2. The correct joint values provided in the feedback differ significantly from the ones generated by the current implementation, especially for `theta2`. This suggests that the orientation adjustment for `theta2` is incorrect.

### Plan to Fix:
1. **Position Calculation**: The position calculation remains valid, as the TCP's position is being reached correctly.
2. **Orientation Adjustment**:
   - The TCP's orientation is influenced by the rotations of both joints about the Y-axis.
   - To achieve the desired orientation, we need to calculate the cumulative rotation about the Y-axis caused by `theta1` and `theta2`.
   - The desired orientation in the Y-axis (`r[1]`) must be matched by the sum of `theta1` and `theta2`.

3. **Correcting `theta2`**:
   - The current implementation adjusts `theta2` as `theta2 = r[1] - theta1`. However, this does not account for the full orientation of the TCP.
   - Instead, we need to calculate `theta2` such that the cumulative rotation about the Y-axis matches the desired orientation.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    # Step 1: Solve for position
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1
    
    # Step 2: Adjust for orientation
    # The desired orientation in the Y-axis is r[1]
    # The cumulative rotation about the Y-axis is theta1 + theta2
    # Adjust theta2 to match the desired orientation
    theta2 += r[1] - (theta1 + theta2)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. The position calculation remains unchanged, as it correctly determines the joint angles required to reach the desired position.
2. The orientation adjustment now ensures that the cumulative rotation about the Y-axis matches the desired orientation (`r[1]`):
   - The cumulative rotation is `theta1 + theta2`.
   - The adjustment ensures that `theta2` is modified to account for the difference between the desired orientation and the current cumulative rotation.

This updated implementation should correctly handle both the position and orientation of the TCP.
