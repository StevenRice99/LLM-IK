The feedback indicates that the code is still failing to reach the correct target positions. The primary issue seems to be that the calculated joint values for θ3 are consistently incorrect, as they are always returning \( \pi \) (3.141592653589793). This suggests that the calculation for θ3 is flawed or unnecessary in this context.

Additionally, the values for θ1 and θ2 are also incorrect, which indicates that the geometry of the manipulator is not being handled properly. The offsets and link lengths are likely not being incorporated correctly into the calculations.

### Observations from Feedback

1. **θ3 is consistently \( \pi \)**:
   - This is likely due to an incorrect assumption or calculation in the θ3 computation. Since the TCP is aligned with the Z-axis, θ3 should be 0 for all targets.

2. **θ1 and θ2 are incorrect**:
   - The values for θ1 and θ2 are close but not accurate. This suggests that the trigonometric relationships or the offsets are not being handled correctly.

3. **The TCP positions are close but not exact**:
   - The calculated TCP positions are near the target positions, which indicates that the general approach is correct but needs refinement.

### Revised Approach

1. **Revisit θ3**:
   - Since the TCP is aligned with the Z-axis, θ3 should always be 0. I will remove the calculation for θ3 and set it to 0.

2. **Refine θ1 and θ2**:
   - I will carefully rederive the equations for θ1 and θ2, ensuring that the offsets and link lengths are properly incorporated.

3. **Simplify the calculations**:
   - I will simplify the equations to avoid unnecessary complexity and reduce the chances of numerical errors.

### Revised Code

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Constants based on the manipulator's structure
    d1 = 0.39225  # Distance from base to Revolute 2 along Z-axis
    d2 = 0.093    # Distance from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3 along Z-axis
    d3 = 0.09465  # Distance from Revolute 3 to TCP along Z-axis

    # Step 1: Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    z_adjusted = z - d3  # Adjust Z position to account for the TCP offset

    # Step 2: Calculate θ1 (rotation about Y-axis for Revolute 1)
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z_adjusted)

    # Step 3: Calculate the distance from the base to the target in the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z_adjusted**2)

    # Step 4: Calculate θ2 (rotation about Y-axis for Revolute 2)
    # Use the law of cosines to find the angle
    h = z_adjusted - d1  # Height difference from Revolute 2 to the target
    L = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)  # Distance from Revolute 2 to the target
    cos_θ2 = (d2**2 + L**2 - d3**2) / (2 * d2 * L)
    cos_θ2 = max(min(cos_θ2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp cos_θ2 to the range [-1, 1]
    θ2 = math.atan2(h, r) - math.acos(cos_θ2)

    # Step 5: Set θ3 to 0 (no rotation about Z-axis)
    θ3 = 0

    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Removed θ3 calculation**:
   - Since the TCP is aligned with the Z-axis, θ3 is always 0. This simplifies the calculations and avoids unnecessary complexity.

2. **Refined θ2 calculation**:
   - The calculation for θ2 now uses the law of cosines and clamps `cos_θ2` to the range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid numerical errors.

3. **Simplified θ1 calculation**:
   - The calculation for θ1 remains the same, as it correctly aligns the TCP horizontally.

### Next Steps

I will test this revised function to ensure it produces the correct joint angles for the given target positions. If further adjustments are needed, I will refine the function accordingly.
