The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values `[1.821476942853737, -0.854787732426554, 0]` confirm that the TCP reaches the target position `[0.45788761895157204, 0.093, -0.04353905443251]`. This indicates that the geometry and offsets of the manipulator are being correctly handled in the forward kinematics.

### Observations:
1. **Revolute 1**:
   - The position of Revolute 1 is `[0, 0, 0]`, and its orientation is `[3.141592653589793, 1.3201157107360562, 3.141592653589793]`.
   - This suggests that the rotation about the Y-axis (theta1) is significant in aligning the manipulator with the target.

2. **Revolute 2**:
   - The position of Revolute 2 is `[0.3799897595499035, 0, -0.09730285266736274]`.
   - This indicates that the second joint contributes to the radial extension and vertical adjustment of the manipulator.

3. **Revolute 3**:
   - The position of Revolute 3 is `[0.3799897595499035, 0.093, -0.09730285266736274]`.
   - The y-offset of `0.093` is consistent with the fixed offset of the third joint.

4. **TCP**:
   - The TCP position `[0.45788761895157176, 0.093, -0.04353905443251033]` matches the target position within numerical precision.

### Key Insights for Fixing the Inverse Kinematics:
1. **Theta1**:
   - The rotation about the Y-axis (theta1) must align the manipulator with the target in the XZ-plane. The current implementation of `theta1` is close but not precise enough.

2. **Theta2**:
   - The second joint must account for the radial extension and vertical adjustment. The current implementation of `theta2` does not correctly model the relationship between the target position and the manipulator's geometry.

3. **Theta3**:
   - The third joint does not contribute to the TCP's y-coordinate, so `theta3` should remain `0`.

### Plan to Fix the Inverse Kinematics:
1. **Refine Theta1**:
   - Use the correct geometry and offsets to compute `theta1` more accurately.

2. **Refine Theta2**:
   - Use the forward kinematics results to better understand the relationship between `theta2` and the target position.

3. **Verify with Forward Kinematics**:
   - After computing the joint angles, use the forward kinematics to verify that the TCP reaches the target position.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to incorporate these insights.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 1)
    # Project the target position onto the XZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 2)
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by Revolute 2
    d = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    adjusted_r = r - d
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_r, z) - theta1

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (rotation about Z-axis of Revolute 3)
    # Since the TCP's y-coordinate is constant, theta3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
