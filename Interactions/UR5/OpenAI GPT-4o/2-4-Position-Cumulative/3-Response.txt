To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understand the structure**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 3 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from the last joint by a fixed distance along the Z-axis.

2. **Break the problem into subproblems**:
   - Use the provided existing solutions to solve for each joint angle step by step.
   - Start from the TCP and work backward to the base.

3. **Plan the solution**:
   - First, calculate the position of the wrist center (WC), which is the position of the TCP minus the offset along the Z-axis of the last link.
   - Use the WC position to solve for θ1 and θ2.
   - Use the orientation of the TCP to solve for θ3.

Now, I will complete the Python function to compute the joint angles.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Constants from the manipulator's structure
    d1 = 0.39225  # Distance along Z from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.093    # Distance along Z from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    d3 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z from Revolute 3 to TCP

    # Step 1: Calculate the wrist center (WC) position
    wc_z = z - d3  # Subtract the TCP offset along Z
    wc_x = x       # X remains the same
    wc_y = y       # Y remains the same

    # Step 2: Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_z)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    # Revolute 2 also rotates about the Y-axis
    # Use the projection of the WC in the YZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    s = wc_y - d1                     # Offset along Y from Revolute 1 to WC
    theta2 = math.atan2(s, r)

    # Step 4: Solve for θ3 (Revolute 3)
    # Revolute 3 rotates about the Z-axis
    # Use the offset between WC and TCP
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, y)  # Orientation of the TCP in the XY plane

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
