The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect and fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issue seems to be with the computation of the joint angles, particularly θ2 and θ3, as the results deviate significantly from the expected values.

### Observations from Feedback:
1. **θ3 is always expected to be 0**: The correct joint values provided in the feedback consistently show that θ3 is 0. This suggests that the TCP orientation does not require any rotation about the Z-axis (Revolute 3). My earlier implementation incorrectly computed θ3 based on the TCP's position, which is unnecessary.
2. **θ1 and θ2 are incorrect**: The computed values for θ1 and θ2 deviate significantly from the correct values. This indicates that the approach to solving for these angles is flawed.

### Plan for Correction:
1. **Revisit the kinematic chain**:
   - Revolute 1 (θ1) rotates about the Y-axis and determines the orientation of the manipulator in the XZ plane.
   - Revolute 2 (θ2) rotates about the Y-axis and determines the elevation of the manipulator to reach the target position.
   - Revolute 3 (θ3) rotates about the Z-axis but is not required for this problem (as per the feedback).

2. **Use the correct approach for θ1 and θ2**:
   - Compute the wrist center (WC) position by subtracting the TCP offset along the Z-axis.
   - Use the WC position to solve for θ1 and θ2 using trigonometric relationships.

3. **Set θ3 to 0**:
   - Since the feedback indicates that θ3 is always 0, we can directly set it to 0.

4. **Test the solution**:
   - Ensure that the computed joint angles produce the correct TCP position.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Constants from the manipulator's structure
    d1 = 0.39225  # Distance along Z from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.093    # Distance along Z from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    d3 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z from Revolute 3 to TCP

    # Step 1: Calculate the wrist center (WC) position
    wc_z = z - d3  # Subtract the TCP offset along Z
    wc_x = x       # X remains the same
    wc_y = y       # Y remains the same

    # Step 2: Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_z)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    # Revolute 2 also rotates about the Y-axis
    # Use the projection of the WC in the YZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    s = wc_y - d1                     # Offset along Y from Revolute 1 to WC
    theta2 = math.atan2(s, r)

    # Step 4: Set θ3 (Revolute 3) to 0
    theta3 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This corrected implementation ensures that θ3 is always 0 and recalculates θ1 and θ2 based on the correct kinematic relationships. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
