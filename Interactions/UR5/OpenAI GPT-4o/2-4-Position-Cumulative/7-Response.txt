The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles. The main issue seems to be with the computation of `theta2` and `theta3`, as the results deviate significantly from the expected joint values. Additionally, the offsets and geometry of the manipulator are not being handled correctly.

### Observations from Feedback:
1. **Theta1**: The computed values for `theta1` are close but not accurate. This suggests that the computation of `theta1` needs refinement, possibly due to incorrect handling of offsets or geometry.
2. **Theta2**: The computed values for `theta2` are significantly off. This indicates that the relationship between the joints and the target position is not being correctly modeled.
3. **Theta3**: The feedback shows that `theta3` is consistently `0` in the correct solutions, which aligns with the fact that the TCP's y-coordinate is constant at `0.093`. However, the current implementation does not explicitly account for this.

### Plan to Fix the Issues:
1. **Refine Theta1 Calculation**:
   - Use the correct geometry of the manipulator to compute `theta1`.
   - Account for the offsets introduced by Revolute 2 and Revolute 3.

2. **Correct Theta2 Calculation**:
   - Use the correct relationship between the target position and the manipulator's geometry to compute `theta2`.
   - Ensure that the offsets introduced by Revolute 3 are properly handled.

3. **Fix Theta3 Calculation**:
   - Explicitly set `theta3` to `0`, as the TCP's y-coordinate is constant and does not require rotation about the Z-axis.

4. **Verify with Forward Kinematics**:
   - Use the forward kinematics to verify that the computed joint angles produce the correct TCP position.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.

### Revised Code:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 1)
    # Project the target position onto the XZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 2)
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by Revolute 2
    d = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    adjusted_r = r - d
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_r, z) - theta1

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (rotation about Z-axis of Revolute 3)
    # Since the TCP's y-coordinate is constant, theta3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Theta1**:
   - The target position is projected onto the XZ-plane to compute the angle `theta1`.
   - This ensures that the rotation about the Y-axis aligns the manipulator with the target position.

2. **Theta2**:
   - The offset introduced by Revolute 2 is subtracted from the radial distance `r` to compute the adjusted position.
   - The angle `theta2` is then computed using the adjusted position and the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Theta3**:
   - Since the TCP's y-coordinate is constant, `theta3` is explicitly set to `0`.

This revised implementation should address the issues identified in the feedback.
