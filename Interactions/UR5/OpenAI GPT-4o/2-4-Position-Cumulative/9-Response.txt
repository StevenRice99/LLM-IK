The feedback indicates that the current implementation still fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issue lies in the computation of θ2, as the values are consistently incorrect. Additionally, θ1 values are also slightly off, which suggests that the approach to solving for these angles is not properly accounting for the manipulator's geometry.

### Observations:
1. **θ2 values are incorrect**: The computed θ2 values are consistently positive, while the correct values include both positive and negative angles. This suggests that the trigonometric relationships used to compute θ2 are incomplete or incorrect.
2. **θ1 values are slightly off**: The computed θ1 values deviate slightly from the correct values, indicating that the approach to solving for θ1 needs refinement.
3. **θ3 is correctly set to 0**: The feedback confirms that θ3 is correctly set to 0, so no changes are needed for θ3.

### Plan for Correction:
1. **Revisit the kinematic chain**:
   - Revolute 1 (θ1) rotates about the Y-axis and determines the orientation of the manipulator in the XZ plane.
   - Revolute 2 (θ2) rotates about the Y-axis and determines the elevation of the manipulator to reach the target position.
   - Revolute 3 (θ3) rotates about the Z-axis but is not required for this problem (as per the feedback).

2. **Use the correct approach for θ1 and θ2**:
   - Compute the wrist center (WC) position by subtracting the TCP offset along the Z-axis.
   - Use the WC position to solve for θ1 and θ2 using trigonometric relationships that account for the manipulator's geometry.

3. **Incorporate the manipulator's link lengths**:
   - The link lengths (d1, d2, d3) must be explicitly used in the calculations for θ1 and θ2 to ensure the correct geometry is considered.

4. **Use the law of cosines for θ2**:
   - The law of cosines can be used to compute θ2 more accurately by considering the triangle formed by the links and the wrist center.

5. **Test the solution**:
   - Ensure that the computed joint angles produce the correct TCP position.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Constants from the manipulator's structure
    d1 = 0.39225  # Distance along Z from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.093    # Distance along Z from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    d3 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z from Revolute 3 to TCP

    # Step 1: Calculate the wrist center (WC) position
    wc_z = z - d3  # Subtract the TCP offset along Z
    wc_x = x       # X remains the same
    wc_y = y       # Y remains the same

    # Step 2: Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(wc_x, wc_z)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    # Use the projection of the WC in the YZ plane
    r = math.sqrt(wc_x**2 + wc_z**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    s = wc_y - d1                     # Offset along Y from Revolute 1 to WC

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ2
    L = math.sqrt(r**2 + s**2)  # Length of the line from Revolute 1 to WC
    cos_theta2 = (d2**2 + L**2 - d1**2) / (2 * d2 * L)
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(s, r) - math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    # Step 4: Set θ3 (Revolute 3) to 0
    theta3 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Law of Cosines for θ2**:
   - The law of cosines is used to compute θ2 more accurately by considering the triangle formed by the links and the wrist center.
   - This ensures that θ2 accounts for the manipulator's geometry and the target position.

2. **Adjusted θ2 Calculation**:
   - The calculation for θ2 now includes an additional term to account for the offset between the wrist center and the base.

3. **No Changes to θ3**:
   - θ3 is still set to 0, as per the feedback.
