It seems there is a repetition of the forward kinematics data. Let me proceed with solving the inverse kinematics problem based on the provided details and existing solutions.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - The manipulator has 3 revolute joints.
   - The task is to compute the joint angles (`theta1`, `theta2`, `theta3`) to reach a given target position `p = (x, y, z)`.

2. **Use Existing Solutions**:
   - Existing Code 1 solves for `theta1` based on the target position.
   - Existing Code 2 solves for `theta2` and `theta3` based on the target position.

3. **Combine the Solutions**:
   - Use the provided solutions to compute all three joint angles.
   - Adjust the solutions to account for the full chain.

4. **Write the Final Function**:
   - Implement the combined solution in the `inverse_kinematics` function.

Here is the completed function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1 using Existing Code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Adjust the target position for the second and third joints
    # Subtract the contribution of the first joint
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225  # Offset of Revolute 2
    adjusted_x = x - 0.093   # Offset of Revolute 3

    # Solve for theta2 and theta3 using Existing Code 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta3 = 0.0  # Assuming no additional rotation for simplicity

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function combines the solutions for all three joints and adjusts for the offsets of each link. It assumes the target position is reachable and does not include any error handling for unreachable positions.
