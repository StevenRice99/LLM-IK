To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3 degrees-of-freedom manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Understand the structure**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 3 rotates about the Z-axis.

2. **Decompose the problem**:
   - Use the provided solutions for sub-chains to simplify the problem.
   - Start from the TCP and work backward to determine the joint angles.

3. **Plan**:
   - Use the position of the TCP to calculate the contribution of each joint.
   - Solve for \( \theta_3 \) using the provided solution for joint 3.
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using the provided solution for joints 7 to 8 (adjusted for this manipulator).

Let me now extend the solution step by step.
To solve the inverse kinematics for the entire chain, I will first calculate the contribution of each joint to the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Adjust the target position for the TCP offset
The TCP is offset by \( [0, 0, 0.09465] \) from the end of Revolute 3. To find the position of the end of Revolute 3, subtract this offset from the target position:
\[
p_{\text{R3}} = (x, y, z - 0.09465)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \theta_3 \)
Using the provided solution for joint 3, we can calculate \( \theta_3 \) as:
\[
\theta_3 = \text{atan2}(x, z - 0.09465)
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)
The position of Revolute 2 is offset by \( [0, 0, 0.39225] \) from Revolute 1. To find the position of Revolute 2, subtract this offset from \( p_{\text{R3}} \):
\[
p_{\text{R2}} = (x, y, z - 0.09465 - 0.39225)
\]
Using the provided solution for joints 7 to 8 (adjusted for this manipulator), we can calculate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Step 4: Combine the results
Return the calculated joint angles \( (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) \).

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Adjust for TCP offset
    z_r3 = z - 0.09465

    # Step 2: Solve for θ3
    theta3 = math.atan2(x, z_r3)

    # Step 3: Adjust for Revolute 2 offset
    z_r2 = z_r3 - 0.39225

    # Step 4: Solve for θ1 and θ2
    A = 0.093  # Link length
    B = 0.09465  # TCP offset
    cos_theta2 = y / A
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2 ** 2)
    M = [[-A * sin_theta2, B], [B, A * sin_theta2]]
    det_M = -A * sin_theta2 * (A * sin_theta2) - B * B
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * (A * sin_theta2), -inv_det_M * B], [-inv_det_M * B, inv_det_M * (-A * sin_theta2)]]
    cos_theta1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z_r2
    sin_theta1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z_r2
    cos_theta1 = max(min(cos_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    sin_theta1 = max(min(sin_theta1, 1.0), -1.0)
    theta1 = math.atan2(sin_theta1, cos_theta1)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
