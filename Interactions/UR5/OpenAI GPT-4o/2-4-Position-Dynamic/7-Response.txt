The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values \([1.821476942853737, -0.854787732426554, 0]\) produce the desired TCP position \([0.45788761895157204, 0.093, -0.04353905443251]\). This indicates that the issue lies in the incorrect computation of the joint angles in the inverse kinematics function.

### Observations:
1. The third joint (\(\theta_3\)) is always \(0\) in the correct solutions. This simplifies the problem, as we can focus on solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) without considering \(\theta_3\).
2. The forward kinematics results show that the TCP position depends on the contributions of \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) through the link lengths and rotations.

### Plan to Fix the Inverse Kinematics:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints (\(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\)) that determine the position of the TCP in the X-Z plane.
   - The Y-coordinate of the TCP is fixed at \(0.093\) due to the offset of the third link.

2. **Simplify the Problem**:
   - Use the target position \((x, y, z)\) to compute \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) based on the link lengths and the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Update the Code**:
   - Correct the computation of \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) using trigonometric relationships.
   - Ensure that the computed joint angles produce the correct TCP position.

I will now update the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Constants for link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of the second link
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length of the TCP offset

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1
    # Project the target position onto the X-Z plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)  # Angle of the projection in the X-Z plane

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    adjusted_r = r - L3  # Subtract the TCP offset
    adjusted_y = y - L2  # Subtract the offset along the Y-axis

    # Use the law of cosines to solve for θ2
    D = (adjusted_r**2 + adjusted_y**2 - L1**2) / (2 * L1 * math.sqrt(adjusted_r**2 + adjusted_y**2))
    D = max(min(D, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp D to the range [-1, 1] to avoid numerical errors
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, adjusted_r) - math.acos(D)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ3
    # Since θ3 is always 0 in the correct solutions, we set it directly
    theta3 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
``` 

### Explanation of the Updated Code:
1. **Step 1: Solve for \(\theta_1\)**:
   - The angle \(\theta_1\) is determined by the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane. This is computed using the `atan2` function.

2. **Step 2: Solve for \(\theta_2\)**:
   - The target position is adjusted to account for the offsets introduced by the TCP and the second link.
   - The law of cosines is used to compute the angle \(\theta_2\), ensuring that the manipulator reaches the correct position.

3. **Step 3: Solve for \(\theta_3\)**:
   - Since \(\theta_3\) is always \(0\) in the correct solutions, it is directly set to \(0\).

This updated function should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target position.
