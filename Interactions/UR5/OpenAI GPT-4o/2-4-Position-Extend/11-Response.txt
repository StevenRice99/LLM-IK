The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values `[1.821476942853737, -0.854787732426554, 0]` produce the desired TCP position `[0.45788761895157176, 0.093, -0.04353905443251033]`. This provides valuable insight into the geometry of the manipulator and the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP position.

### Observations:
1. **Revolute 1**:
   - The first joint rotates about the Y-axis, and its position remains `[0, 0, 0]`.
   - The orientation of Revolute 1 is `[3.141592653589793, 1.3201157107360562, 3.141592653589793]`, which corresponds to the rotation caused by `theta1 = 1.821476942853737`.

2. **Revolute 2**:
   - The second joint is offset along the Z-axis by `0.39225` (length of the first link).
   - Its position is `[0.3799897595499035, 0, -0.09730285266736274]`, which reflects the combined effect of `theta1` and `theta2`.

3. **Revolute 3**:
   - The third joint is offset along the Y-axis by `0.093` (length of the third link).
   - Its position is `[0.3799897595499035, 0.093, -0.09730285266736274]`.

4. **TCP**:
   - The TCP is offset along the Z-axis by `0.09465` (length of the TCP link).
   - Its position is `[0.45788761895157176, 0.093, -0.04353905443251033]`.

### Key Insights:
- The second joint angle (`theta2`) significantly affects the position of Revolute 2 and, consequently, the TCP.
- The third joint angle (`theta3`) does not contribute to the TCP's position in this case, as it is `0`.

### Plan to Fix the Solution:
1. **Revisit the Calculation of `theta2`**:
   - Use the correct geometry to calculate `theta2` based on the position of Revolute 2.

2. **Revisit the Calculation of `theta1`**:
   - Ensure that `theta1` correctly aligns the manipulator with the target position in the XZ-plane.

3. **Verify the Solution**:
   - Use the forward kinematics results to verify the calculated joint angles.

I will now revise the solution to address these issues.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.093, 0.09465] in the local frame of the third joint
    z_adjusted = z - 0.09465
    y_adjusted = y - 0.093

    # Step 2: Solve for theta1
    # Project the target position onto the XZ-plane to calculate theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z_adjusted)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the adjusted target position
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z_adjusted**2)
    d1 = 0.39225  # Length of the first link
    d2 = 0.093  # Length of the second link

    # Use the law of cosines to calculate theta2
    cos_theta2 = (r**2 - d1**2 - d2**2) / (2 * d1 * d2)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2) - math.pi / 2

    # Step 4: Solve for theta3
    # Based on the feedback, theta3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
``` 

This revised solution incorporates the forward kinematics results and ensures that the calculations for `theta1` and `theta2` are based on the correct geometry of the manipulator. The third joint angle (`theta3`) is set to `0` as indicated by the feedback.
