To solve the inverse kinematics for the full 3-DOF manipulator, we need to extend the provided solution for the first two joints to include the third joint. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Understand the Existing Solution**: The provided solution calculates the angles for the first two joints (`theta1` and `theta2`) to position the end of the second link (just before the third joint) at the desired target position `p`.

2. **Extend to the Third Joint**: The third joint rotates about the Z-axis and contributes to the final position of the TCP. The TCP is offset from the end of the second link by `[0, 0.093, 0.09465]` in the local frame of the third joint.

3. **Calculate the Third Joint Angle (`theta3`)**:
   - Use the target position `p` and the position of the end of the second link (calculated using `theta1` and `theta2`) to determine the required rotation of the third joint.
   - The third joint's rotation affects the Y-axis position of the TCP.

4. **Combine All Joint Angles**: Return the calculated values of `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3`.

Now, I will complete the Python function to implement this solution.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1 and theta2 using the provided solution
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1

    # Calculate the position of the end of the second link
    end_of_link2_x = 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    end_of_link2_y = 0
    end_of_link2_z = 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)

    # Calculate the position of the TCP relative to the end of the second link
    tcp_relative_x = x - end_of_link2_x
    tcp_relative_y = y - end_of_link2_y
    tcp_relative_z = z - end_of_link2_z

    # Solve for theta3
    # The TCP is offset by [0, 0.093, 0.09465] in the local frame of the third joint
    theta3 = math.atan2(tcp_relative_y, 0.093)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles `theta1`, `theta2`, and `theta3` to position the TCP at the desired target position `p`. It extends the provided solution for the first two joints by incorporating the contribution of the third joint.
