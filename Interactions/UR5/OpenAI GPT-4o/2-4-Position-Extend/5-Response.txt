To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) that position the TCP at the desired target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Kinematic Chain
1. **Revolute 1** rotates about the Y-axis and affects the position of the TCP in the X-Z plane.
2. **Revolute 2** also rotates about the Y-axis and contributes to the vertical displacement of the TCP.
3. **Revolute 3** rotates about the Z-axis and contributes to the final positioning of the TCP.

### Step 2: Use the Provided Sub-chain Solution
The existing solution provides a method to calculate \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) for the first two links. This solution assumes that the third link is fixed. We will extend this to include the effect of \(\theta_3\).

### Step 3: Solve for \(\theta_3\)
The third joint rotates about the Z-axis and contributes to the final position of the TCP. We will calculate \(\theta_3\) by considering the relative position of the TCP after accounting for the contributions of the first two joints.

### Step 4: Write the Complete Solution
We will now complete the `inverse_kinematics` function to calculate all three joint angles.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 3
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length from link 3 to TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis of Revolute 2)
    # Project the target position onto the Y-Z plane
    z_proj = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2) - l3  # Adjust for the TCP offset
    y_proj = y

    # Use trigonometry to solve for theta2
    d = math.sqrt(z_proj**2 + y_proj**2)  # Distance to the projected point
    if d > (l1 + l2):
        raise ValueError("Target is out of reach")

    # Law of cosines to find the angle at the second joint
    cos_theta2 = (l1**2 + d**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * d)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Adjust theta2 based on the target position
    theta2 += math.atan2(y_proj, z_proj)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (rotation about Z-axis of Revolute 3)
    # Remaining displacement after accounting for the first two joints
    z_remain = z_proj - l1 * math.cos(theta2)
    y_remain = y_proj - l1 * math.sin(theta2)

    # Use trigonometry to solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_remain, z_remain)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Theta1**: Calculated using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
2. **Theta2**: Solved using the law of cosines and adjusted based on the projection of the target position onto the Y-Z plane.
3. **Theta3**: Determined by the remaining displacement after accounting for the contributions of the first two joints.

This solution ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position \(p = (x, y, z)\) while respecting the kinematic constraints of the manipulator.
