The feedback indicates that the revised inverse kinematics function still fails to compute correct joint values for many targets. Specifically, the following issues are evident:

1. **NaN (Not a Number) Results**: This occurs when invalid operations, such as taking the square root of a negative number or arcsin of a value outside the range \([-1, 1]\), are performed. This suggests that the trigonometric calculations for \(\theta_2\) are incorrect or improperly constrained.
2. **Incorrect Joint Values**: Even when the function does not produce NaN, the computed joint values are incorrect, leading to TCP positions that deviate from the target.

### Observations from the Correct Solutions
1. The correct solutions consistently set \(\theta_3 = 0\), which simplifies the problem to solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
2. The correct values for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are derived from the TCP position, considering the kinematic chain and the geometry of the manipulator.

### Revised Approach
To address the issues, I will:
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Chain**: Carefully analyze the geometry and constraints of the manipulator to derive accurate equations for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\).
2. **Avoid Invalid Operations**: Ensure that all trigonometric calculations are within valid ranges to prevent NaN results.
3. **Simplify the Problem**: Focus on solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) using the TCP position and the known link lengths.

Let me revise the inverse kinematics function accordingly.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Compute the position of the third joint
    # Subtract the TCP offset
    z_joint3 = z - 0.09465
    y_joint3 = y - 0.093  # Offset along the Y-axis

    # Step 2: Solve for theta1
    # The first joint contributes a rotation about the Y-axis
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z_joint3)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2
    # The second joint contributes a rotation about the Y-axis and a translation along the Z-axis
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z_joint3**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    d = 0.39225  # Link length
    if r < d:
        raise ValueError("Target is too close to the base for the manipulator to reach.")
    theta2 = np.arccos((r - d) / r)

    # Step 4: Set theta3 to 0
    theta3 = 0

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This revised function:
1. Computes the distance \(r\) in the XZ plane and ensures it is valid for the manipulator's geometry.
2. Uses \(\arccos\) to compute \(\theta_2\), ensuring the result is within the valid range.
3. Sets \(\theta_3 = 0\) as a simplifying assumption.

Let me know if further adjustments are needed.
