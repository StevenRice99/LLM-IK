To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Kinematic Chain
The robot has three revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1**: Rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2**: Rotates about the Y-axis.
3. **Revolute 3**: Rotates about the Z-axis.

The TCP is located at a fixed offset from the third joint:
- TCP offset: \( [0, 0, 0.09465] \).

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics equations describe the position of the TCP as a function of the joint angles. Using the given link positions and orientations:
1. Revolute 1 contributes a rotation about the Y-axis.
2. Revolute 2 contributes a rotation about the Y-axis and a translation along the Z-axis.
3. Revolute 3 contributes a rotation about the Z-axis and a translation along the Y-axis.

The TCP position can be expressed as:
\[
\text{TCP} = f(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)
\]

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
To solve for \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \), we need to invert the forward kinematics equations. The steps are:
1. Compute the position of the third joint by subtracting the TCP offset.
2. Solve for \( \theta_3 \) using the Y-axis rotation.
3. Solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the Z-axis translation.
4. Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the remaining transformations.

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
Now, I will implement the inverse kinematics function in Python.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Compute the position of the third joint
    # Subtract the TCP offset
    z_joint3 = z - 0.09465

    # Step 2: Solve for theta3
    # The third joint contributes a translation along the Y-axis
    theta3 = np.arctan2(y, z_joint3)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2
    # The second joint contributes a translation along the Z-axis
    z_joint2 = z_joint3 - 0.093 * np.sin(theta3)
    theta2 = np.arctan2(z_joint2 - 0.39225, x)

    # Step 4: Solve for theta1
    # The first joint contributes a rotation about the Y-axis
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z_joint2)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
