The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values \([1.821476942853737, -0.854787732426554, 0]\) produce the desired TCP position \([0.45788761895157204, 0.093, -0.04353905443251]\). This indicates that the issue lies in the inverse kinematics function I provided earlier.

### Observations from the Feedback
1. The third joint angle (\(\theta_3\)) is consistently \(0\) in the correct solutions, which simplifies the problem. This suggests that the TCP's position is primarily determined by the first two joints (\(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\)).
2. The incorrect solutions often include non-zero values for \(\theta_3\), which leads to deviations in the TCP position.
3. The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values show that the TCP position is achieved through a combination of rotations and translations along the Y and Z axes.

### Adjustments to the Inverse Kinematics Function
To improve the inverse kinematics function:
1. I will set \(\theta_3 = 0\) as a simplifying assumption, as it is consistently \(0\) in the correct solutions.
2. I will focus on solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) using the TCP position and the kinematic chain.

Let me revise the inverse kinematics function accordingly.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Compute the position of the second joint
    # Subtract the TCP offset
    z_joint3 = z - 0.09465
    y_joint3 = y - 0.093  # Offset along the Y-axis

    # Step 2: Solve for theta1
    # The first joint contributes a rotation about the Y-axis
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z_joint3)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2
    # The second joint contributes a rotation about the Y-axis and a translation along the Z-axis
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z_joint3**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    d = 0.39225  # Link length
    theta2 = np.arcsin((z_joint3 - d) / r)

    # Step 4: Set theta3 to 0
    theta3 = 0

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This revised function assumes \(\theta_3 = 0\) and focuses on solving for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) based on the TCP position. It uses trigonometric relationships to compute the joint angles.
