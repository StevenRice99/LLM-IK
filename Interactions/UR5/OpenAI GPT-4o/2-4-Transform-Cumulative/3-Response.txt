To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions of each link:
- Revolute 1: Base position at \([0, 0, 0]\).
- Revolute 2: Offset along the z-axis by \(0.39225\).
- Revolute 3: Offset along the z-axis by \(0.39225\) and along the y-axis by \(0.093\).
- TCP: Offset further along the z-axis by \(0.09465\).

The TCP position in the base frame is:
\[
\text{TCP Position} = [0, 0.093, 0.4869]
\]

### Step 2: Use Existing Solutions
The existing solutions provide the inverse kinematics for sub-chains:
1. **Existing Code 1**: Solves for \( \theta_1 \) based on the x and z coordinates of the target position.
2. **Existing Code 2**: Solves for \( \theta_2 \) based on the x and z coordinates of the target position.
3. **Existing Code 3**: Solves for \( \theta_3 \) based on the y and x coordinates of the target position.

### Step 3: Solve for Each Joint
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
   - The first joint rotates about the y-axis. Using the x and z coordinates of the target position, we can compute \( \theta_1 \) using:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
     \]

2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**:
   - The second joint also rotates about the y-axis. After accounting for the offset introduced by Revolute 1, we compute \( \theta_2 \) using:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arctan2(px, pz)
     \]

3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**:
   - The third joint rotates about the z-axis. Using the y and x coordinates of the target position, we compute \( \theta_3 \) using:
     \[
     \theta_3 = \arctan2(y, x)
     \]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
We will now implement the inverse kinematics function to compute \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) based on the target position \( p \) and orientation \( r \).

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(x, z)  # Adjusted for the second joint
    
    # Solve for theta3
    theta3 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function computes the joint angles required to position the TCP at the desired location and orientation.
