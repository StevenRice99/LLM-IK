It seems that the forward kinematics results are consistent and provide the positions and orientations of the links and the TCP. Now, I will proceed to derive the inverse kinematics solution for the given manipulator.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Inverse Kinematics
1. **Understand the Target**: The target position `p` and orientation `r` are given. The goal is to compute the joint angles (`θ1`, `θ2`, `θ3`) that achieve this target.

2. **Kinematic Chain**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 3 rotates about the Z-axis.

3. **TCP Position**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by the joint angles and the link lengths.
   - The forward kinematics equations will be inverted to solve for the joint angles.

4. **Orientation**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the cumulative rotations of the joints.

5. **Solve for Each Joint**:
   - Use the target position and orientation to solve for each joint angle analytically.

I will now proceed to implement the inverse kinematics function.

import numpy as np

    """

    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].

    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length of TCP offset

    # Step 1: Solve for θ3 (Revolute 3)
    # The TCP offset along the Z-axis is due to L3
    pz_eff = pz - L3  # Effective Z position after accounting for TCP offset

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    # The effective position in the YZ plane is influenced by θ2
    d = np.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)  # Distance in the XY plane
    θ2 = np.arctan2(pz_eff - L1, d)  # θ2 is the angle in the YZ plane

    # Step 3: Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    # θ1 is the angle in the XY plane
    θ1 = np.arctan2(py, px)

    # Step 4: Solve for θ3 (Revolute 3)
    # θ3 is the orientation about the Z-axis
    θ3 = rz  # Directly corresponds to the Z-axis rotation

    # Return the joint angles
    return θ1, θ2, θ3
