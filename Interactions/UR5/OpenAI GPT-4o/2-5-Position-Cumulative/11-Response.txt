The feedback indicates that the revised implementation still fails to compute the correct joint values for the given target positions. The discrepancies suggest that the approach used to compute the joint angles is fundamentally flawed. Specifically, the following issues are evident:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Link Lengths and Offsets**: The link lengths and offsets are not being correctly incorporated into the calculations, leading to significant errors in the computed joint values.
2. **Incorrect Use of Trigonometric Functions**: The use of `atan2` and other trigonometric functions does not correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator.
3. **Lack of Validation**: The computed joint values are not being validated using forward kinematics to ensure they produce the correct target position.

### Revised Approach
To address these issues, I will:
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Chain**: Carefully analyze the kinematic chain of the manipulator and derive the equations for each joint angle based on the target position.
2. **Incorporate Forward Kinematics**: Use forward kinematics to validate the computed joint values and refine the calculations as needed.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Adjust the calculations step by step to match the correct joint values provided in the feedback.

### Revised Implementation
Here is the updated inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths and offsets
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1 (Revolute 2 offset along Z)
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2 (Revolute 3 offset along Y)
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3 (Revolute 4 offset along Z)
    L4 = 0.0823   # Length of the TCP offset along Y

    # Step 1: Compute θ1 (Revolute 1)
    # θ1 is determined by the projection of the TCP onto the X-Z plane
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Compute θ2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust for the offset of Revolute 2 along the Z-axis (L1)
    z2 = z - L1
    r2 = math.sqrt(x**2 + z2**2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    θ2 = math.atan2(y, r2)

    # Step 3: Compute θ3 (Revolute 3)
    # Adjust for the offset of Revolute 3 along the Y-axis (L2)
    y3 = y - L2
    r3 = math.sqrt(x**2 + y3**2)  # Distance in the X-Y plane
    θ3 = math.atan2(x, y3)

    # Step 4: Compute θ4 (Revolute 4)
    # Adjust for the offset of Revolute 4 along the Z-axis (L3)
    z4 = z2 - L3
    r4 = math.sqrt(y3**2 + z4**2)  # Distance in the Y-Z plane
    θ4 = math.atan2(y3, z4)

    return θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Link Lengths and Offsets**: The link lengths and offsets (L1, L2, L3, L4) are explicitly included in the calculations to account for the physical dimensions of the robot.
2. **Step-by-Step Refinement**: Each joint angle is computed step by step, considering the geometry of the manipulator and the target position.
3. **Trigonometric Functions**: The `atan2` function is used to compute angles based on the relative positions of the target and the joints.

### Next Steps
I recommend testing this revised implementation on the provided test cases to verify its accuracy. If further adjustments are needed, I will refine the calculations based on the results.
