The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values `[0.732438907378118, 2.6343065320531682, -2.581195919312748, 0]` confirm that the TCP reaches the target position `[0.198520422463753, 0.023288253734007003, 0.209160930525798]`. This indicates that the inverse kinematics solution provided earlier is incorrect.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results show the correct joint values produce the desired TCP position.
2. The incorrect joint values generated by the earlier inverse kinematics function fail to reach the target position.

### Plan to Fix:
1. Analyze the forward kinematics results to understand the relationship between joint angles and the TCP position.
2. Revise the inverse kinematics function to correctly compute the joint angles step by step, ensuring alignment with the forward kinematics.

Let me revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.
Here is the revised inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (Joint 1)
    # Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis, so we use the projection of the target on the XZ-plane.
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for θ3 (Joint 3)
    # Joint 3 rotates around the Z-axis. Use the projection of the target on the XY-plane.
    θ3 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2 (Joint 2)
    # Joint 2 also rotates around the Y-axis. Use the height (z) and the offset from the base.
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    h = y - 0.39225  # Height offset from the base to the target
    L1 = 0.093  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 2

    # Use the law of cosines to find θ2
    cosθ2 = (d**2 + h**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to avoid numerical errors
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)

    # Step 4: Solve for θ4 (Joint 4)
    # Joint 4 rotates around the Y-axis. Use the remaining orientation to align the TCP.
    θ4 = 0  # Assuming no additional rotation is needed for the TCP

    return θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Corrected θ1 and θ3 Calculations**:
   - θ1 is calculated using the projection of the target on the XZ-plane.
   - θ3 is calculated using the projection of the target on the XY-plane.

2. **Revised θ2 Calculation**:
   - Used the law of cosines to compute θ2 based on the geometry of the manipulator.

3. **Assumed θ4**:
   - Set θ4 to 0, as the TCP orientation is not explicitly specified in the problem.

This revised function should now correctly compute the joint angles to reach the target position.
