It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. I will now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function based on the provided details and existing solutions.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1**: Use the position of the TCP to calculate the angle for Revolute 1.
2. **Joint 2**: Adjust the position based on the contribution of Joint 1 and calculate the angle for Revolute 2.
3. **Joint 3**: Use the adjusted position to calculate the angle for Revolute 3.
4. **Joint 4**: Use the final adjusted position to calculate the angle for Revolute 4.

Here is the completed code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Joint 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Adjust position for Joint 2
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z) - theta1

    # Adjust position for Joint 3
    adjusted_y = y - 0.093
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_y, adjusted_x)

    # Adjust position for Joint 4
    adjusted_z_final = adjusted_z - 0.09465
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z_final)

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to reach the target position `p` by solving for each joint sequentially and adjusting the position accordingly.
