It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. Now, I will proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function based on the given details and existing solutions.

### Analysis:
1. The TCP position is `[x, y, z]`.
2. The manipulator has 4 revolute joints with the following axes:
   - Joint 1: Y-axis
   - Joint 2: Y-axis
   - Joint 3: Z-axis
   - Joint 4: Y-axis
3. The goal is to compute the joint angles `[θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4]` to reach the target position.

### Plan:
- Use the provided existing solutions and the forward kinematics data to compute the joint angles step by step.
- Start from the base (joint 1) and work towards the TCP.

Here is the completed inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (Joint 1)
    # Joint 1 rotates around the Y-axis, so we use the projection of the target on the XZ-plane.
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 (Joint 2)
    # Joint 2 also rotates around the Y-axis. Use the height (z) and the offset from the base.
    d = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    h = y - 0.39225  # Height offset from the base to the target
    L1 = 0.093  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 2

    # Use the law of cosines to find θ2
    cosθ2 = (d**2 + h**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)
    cosθ2 = max(min(cosθ2, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to avoid numerical errors
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ3 (Joint 3)
    # Joint 3 rotates around the Z-axis. Use the projection of the target on the XY-plane.
    θ3 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 4: Solve for θ4 (Joint 4)
    # Joint 4 rotates around the Y-axis. Use the remaining orientation to align the TCP.
    θ4 = math.atan2(-z, x)

    return θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4
```

This function computes the joint angles step by step, ensuring that the manipulator reaches the target position `[x, y, z]`.
