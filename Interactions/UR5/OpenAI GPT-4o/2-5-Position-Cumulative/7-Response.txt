It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. I will now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function based on the provided details and existing solutions.

### Analysis
The task is to compute the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) for the 4-DOF manipulator to reach the target position `p = (x, y, z)`.

1. **Revolute 1 (θ1)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane determines θ1.
2. **Revolute 2 (θ2)**: This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the Y-Z plane determines θ2.
3. **Revolute 3 (θ3)**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. The position of the TCP in the X-Y plane determines θ3.
4. **Revolute 4 (θ4)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The orientation of the TCP determines θ4.

I will use the provided existing solutions and the forward kinematics data to compute the joint angles step by step.

### Implementation
Here is the completed inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Compute θ1 (Revolute 1)
    # θ1 is determined by the projection of the TCP onto the X-Z plane
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Compute θ2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust for the offset of Revolute 2 along the Z-axis (0.39225)
    z2 = z - 0.39225
    θ2 = math.atan2(y, z2)

    # Step 3: Compute θ3 (Revolute 3)
    # Adjust for the offset of Revolute 3 along the Y-axis (0.093)
    y3 = y - 0.093
    θ3 = math.atan2(x, y3)

    # Step 4: Compute θ4 (Revolute 4)
    # Adjust for the offset of Revolute 4 along the Z-axis (0.09465)
    z4 = z2 - 0.09465
    θ4 = math.atan2(y3, z4)

    return θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4
```

This function calculates the joint angles step by step, considering the offsets and link lengths provided in the details. It uses trigonometric functions to compute the angles based on the target position `p`.
