To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 4-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions of each link and the TCP. The TCP position is influenced by all four joints. The provided forward kinematics confirms the structure of the manipulator and the transformations.

### Step 2: Use Existing Solutions
- **Existing Code 1** solves for \( \theta_3 \) based on the target position \( p \).
- **Existing Code 2** solves for \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) for a sub-chain of the manipulator.

We will extend these solutions to include \( \theta_4 \), which is the final joint.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_4 \)
The orientation of the TCP is influenced by \( \theta_4 \). The TCP's orientation is given as \( [0, 0, 1.570796325] \), which corresponds to a rotation about the Y-axis. This means \( \theta_4 \) can be directly determined from the orientation of the TCP.

### Step 4: Combine the Solutions
We will combine the solutions for \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) (from Existing Code 2) and \( \theta_4 \) to complete the inverse kinematics.

Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for θ1, θ2, θ3 using Existing Code 2
    A = 0.09465
    B = 0.0823
    cosθ2 = (y - 0.093) / 0.0823
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    sinθ2 = math.sin(θ2)
    M = [[A, -B * sinθ2], [B * sinθ2, A]]
    det_M = M[0][0] * M[1][1] - M[0][1] * M[1][0]
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * M[1][1], -inv_det_M * M[0][1]], [-inv_det_M * M[1][0], inv_det_M * M[0][0]]]
    sinθ1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z
    cosθ1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)
    θ3 = 0.0  # From Existing Code 2
    
    # Solve for θ4 based on the TCP orientation
    # The TCP orientation is [0, 0, 1.570796325], which corresponds to θ4
    θ4 = 1.570796325  # Directly from the TCP orientation
    
    return (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4)
```

### Explanation
1. **Existing Code 2** is used to compute \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) based on the target position \( p \).
2. \( \theta_4 \) is directly determined from the TCP's orientation, as it corresponds to a rotation about the Y-axis.

This function assumes that the target position is always reachable and does not include checks for singularities or unreachable positions, as per the instructions.
