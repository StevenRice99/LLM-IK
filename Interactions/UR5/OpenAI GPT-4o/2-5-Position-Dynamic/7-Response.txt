It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. I will now proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function by combining the solutions for the sub-chains and solving for the entire chain.

### Plan:
1. Use the provided solutions for the sub-chains:
   - Existing Code 1 solves for joints 1 and 2.
   - Existing Code 2 solves for joints 3 and 4.
2. Adjust the target position `p` for each sub-chain based on the transformations of the previous joints.
3. Combine the results to return the joint angles for all four joints.

Here is the completed inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for joints 1 and 2 using Existing Code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    adjusted_x = x - 0.39225 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225 * math.cos(theta1)
    theta_total = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    theta2 = theta_total - theta1

    # Adjust the target position for joints 3 and 4
    # Subtract the contribution of joints 1 and 2
    adjusted_y = y - 0.093  # Offset from Revolute 3
    adjusted_z = z - 0.39225  # Offset from Revolute 2

    # Solve for joints 3 and 4 using Existing Code 2
    theta3 = math.atan2(-adjusted_y, adjusted_z)
    theta4 = 0.0  # Fixed orientation for the TCP

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)
```

This function combines the solutions for the sub-chains and adjusts the target position for each sub-chain based on the transformations of the previous joints. It returns the joint angles for all four joints.
