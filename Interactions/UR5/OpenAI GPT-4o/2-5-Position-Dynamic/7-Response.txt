The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issues seem to be:

1. **Incorrect computation of joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \):** The current implementation does not properly account for the geometry of the manipulator and the constraints imposed by the target position.
2. **Incorrect handling of \( \theta_4 \):** The value of \( \theta_4 \) is hardcoded to \( 1.570796325 \), which is incorrect for most target positions. \( \theta_4 \) should be computed based on the orientation of the TCP relative to the manipulator's configuration.

### Plan to Fix the Issues
To address these problems, I will:
1. Revisit the geometry of the manipulator and derive the correct equations for \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \) based on the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).
2. Compute \( \theta_4 \) based on the orientation of the TCP, ensuring it aligns with the desired orientation.

Let me start by revisiting the geometry and deriving the correct equations for \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \).
To derive the correct equations for \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3 \), we need to carefully analyze the manipulator's geometry and kinematics. Here's the step-by-step process:

---

### Step 1: Geometry of the Manipulator
The manipulator has the following structure:
1. **Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \)):** Rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \)):** Rotates about the Y-axis.
3. **Revolute 3 (\( \theta_3 \)):** Rotates about the Z-axis.
4. **Revolute 4 (\( \theta_4 \)):** Rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by all four joints, and the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) must be reached.

---

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics equations describe the position of the TCP as a function of the joint angles. Using the link positions and orientations provided, the TCP position can be expressed as:
\[
\text{TCP} = f(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4)
\]
We need to invert this relationship to solve for \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \).

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint, \( \theta_1 \), determines the rotation about the Y-axis. The projection of the target position \( p \) onto the XZ-plane can be used to compute \( \theta_1 \):
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joints, \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \), determine the position of the TCP in the YZ-plane. Using the link lengths and the target position \( p \), we can derive the equations for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \) using trigonometry.

Let:
- \( d_1 = 0.39225 \) (distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along Z-axis),
- \( d_2 = 0.093 \) (distance from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3 along Y-axis),
- \( d_3 = 0.09465 \) (distance from Revolute 3 to Revolute 4 along Z-axis),
- \( d_4 = 0.0823 \) (distance from Revolute 4 to TCP along Y-axis).

The effective position of the TCP in the YZ-plane is:
\[
y_{\text{eff}} = y - d_2
\]
\[
z_{\text{eff}} = z - d_1
\]

Using the law of cosines, we can compute \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \):
\[
r = \sqrt{y_{\text{eff}}^2 + z_{\text{eff}}^2}
\]
\[
\cos(\theta_3) = \frac{r^2 - d_3^2 - d_4^2}{2 \cdot d_3 \cdot d_4}
\]
\[
\theta_3 = \arccos(\cos(\theta_3))
\]

For \( \theta_2 \), we use:
\[
\theta_2 = \arctan2(y_{\text{eff}}, z_{\text{eff}}) - \arctan2(d_4 \cdot \sin(\theta_3), d_3 + d_4 \cdot \cos(\theta_3))
\]

---

### Step 5: Solve for \( \theta_4 \)
The fourth joint, \( \theta_4 \), determines the orientation of the TCP. The desired orientation of the TCP is given as \( [0, 0, 1.570796325] \), which corresponds to a rotation about the Y-axis. Therefore:
\[
\theta_4 = 0
\]

---

### Step 6: Combine the Results
Now that we have derived the equations for \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \), we can implement them in the Python function.

---

### Updated Python Code
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    d1 = 0.39225
    d2 = 0.093
    d3 = 0.09465
    d4 = 0.0823
    
    # Solve for θ1
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Effective position in the YZ-plane
    y_eff = y - d2
    z_eff = z - d1
    
    # Distance to the target in the YZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(y_eff**2 + z_eff**2)
    
    # Solve for θ3
    cosθ3 = (r**2 - d3**2 - d4**2) / (2 * d3 * d4)
    θ3 = math.acos(cosθ3)
    
    # Solve for θ2
    θ2 = math.atan2(y_eff, z_eff) - math.atan2(d4 * math.sin(θ3), d3 + d4 * math.cos(θ3))
    
    # Solve for θ4
    θ4 = 0  # TCP orientation is fixed
    
    return (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4)
```

This implementation should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target position.
