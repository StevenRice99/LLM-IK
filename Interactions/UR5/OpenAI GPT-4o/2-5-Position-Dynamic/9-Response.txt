It seems that the forward kinematics results are consistent and provide the positions and orientations of each link and the TCP. Now, I will proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function based on the given details and the existing solutions.

### Analysis:
1. **Revolute 1 and 2**: These joints rotate about the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the X-Z plane will help determine these angles.
2. **Revolute 3**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. The existing solution for joint 3 can be used to calculate its angle.
3. **Revolute 4**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The position of the TCP in the Y-axis and the geometry of the manipulator will help determine this angle.

### Plan:
- Use the geometry of the manipulator and the target position `p` to calculate the angles for each joint.
- Combine the solutions for each joint into a single function.

Here is the completed inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Constants from the manipulator's geometry
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.093    # Length from Revolute 2 to Revolute 3
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length from Revolute 3 to Revolute 4
    L4 = 0.0823   # Length from Revolute 4 to TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for Revolute 1 (θ1) and Revolute 2 (θ2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the X-Z plane
    θ1 = math.atan2(x, z)  # Angle for Revolute 1

    # Adjust for the height of the TCP
    h = y - L2  # Height adjustment for Revolute 2
    d = math.sqrt(r**2 + h**2)  # Distance to the TCP from Revolute 2
    θ2 = math.atan2(h, r) - math.acos((L3**2 + d**2 - L4**2) / (2 * L3 * d))

    # Step 2: Solve for Revolute 3 (θ3)
    θ3 = math.acos((L3**2 + L4**2 - d**2) / (2 * L3 * L4))

    # Step 3: Solve for Revolute 4 (θ4)
    θ4 = math.pi / 2 - θ2 - θ3  # Adjust for the orientation of the TCP

    return θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4
```

This function calculates the joint angles required to position the TCP at the given target position `p`. Let me know if further clarification or testing is needed!
