Let's analyze the problem step by step to derive the inverse kinematics solution for the given 4-DOF manipulator.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
The manipulator has 4 revolute joints, and the task is to compute the joint angles \((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4)\) required to position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at a given target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). The manipulator's structure and joint axes are as follows:
- Revolute 1: Rotates about the Y-axis.
- Revolute 2: Rotates about the Y-axis.
- Revolute 3: Rotates about the Z-axis.
- Revolute 4: Rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP is offset from the last joint by a fixed position \([0, 0.0823, 0]\).

### Step 2: Kinematic Chain
The forward kinematics of the manipulator can be expressed as a series of transformations:
1. \(T_1\): Transformation due to Revolute 1.
2. \(T_2\): Transformation due to Revolute 2.
3. \(T_3\): Transformation due to Revolute 3.
4. \(T_4\): Transformation due to Revolute 4.
5. \(T_{TCP}\): Fixed offset to the TCP.

The overall transformation is:
\[
T = T_1 \cdot T_2 \cdot T_3 \cdot T_4 \cdot T_{TCP}
\]

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
To compute the joint angles, we work backward from the target position \(p\):
1. Subtract the TCP offset to find the position of the last joint.
2. Solve for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) using the projection of the target position onto the YZ-plane.
3. Solve for \(\theta_3\) using the position of the third joint.
4. Solve for \(\theta_4\) using the orientation of the TCP.

### Step 4: Implementation
We will now implement the inverse kinematics function in Python.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Step 1: Subtract TCP offset
    z -= 0.0823  # Subtract the TCP offset along the Z-axis

    # Step 2: Solve for θ1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)

    # Step 3: Solve for θ2 (Revolute 2)
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the YZ-plane
    l1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1
    l2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3

    # Use the law of cosines to find θ2
    cos_theta2 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta2 = np.arccos(cos_theta2)

    # Step 4: Solve for θ3 (Revolute 3)
    theta3 = np.arctan2(y, l2 + l3)

    # Step 5: Solve for θ4 (Revolute 4)
    theta4 = 0  # Assuming no additional rotation for simplicity

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function computes the joint angles required to position the TCP at the target position \(p\). Note that the solution assumes the target is reachable and does not handle edge cases or singularities.
