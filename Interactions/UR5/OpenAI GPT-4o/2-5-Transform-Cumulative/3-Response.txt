To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator, I will break the problem into steps, solving for each joint angle sequentially. Here's the plan:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and calculating the angle using `atan2`.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2)**: This joint also rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by considering the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane after accounting for the contribution of Joint 1.

3. **Joint 3 (Revolute 3)**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. Its angle can be determined by analyzing the position of the TCP relative to the previous link.

4. **Joint 4 (Revolute 4)**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. Its angle can be determined by analyzing the orientation of the TCP relative to the previous link.

I will now proceed to implement the solution for the inverse kinematics method.
