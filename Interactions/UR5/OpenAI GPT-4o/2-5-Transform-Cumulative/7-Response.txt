The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values `[0.7861720206813361, -2.6342979458695943, 2.581194901430135, -0.165872286799183]` produce the desired target position and orientation. This indicates that the issue lies in the logic of the inverse kinematics function I provided earlier.

To address this, I will revise the inverse kinematics function to better account for the relationships between the joints and the target position/orientation. Specifically, I will:

1. Use the correct offsets and transformations for each joint.
2. Ensure that the orientation of the TCP is properly decomposed into the contributions of each joint.
3. Verify the calculations for each joint angle step by step.

Here is the revised implementation:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.39225  # Offset for Joint 2
    d2 = 0.093    # Offset for Joint 3
    d3 = 0.09465  # Offset for Joint 4
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP offset along Y-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    # Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of Joint 1
    adjusted_pz = pz - d1 * math.cos(theta1)
    adjusted_px = px - d1 * math.sin(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_px, adjusted_pz)

    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    # Joint 3 rotates about the Z-axis
    adjusted_py = py - d2
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_py, adjusted_px)

    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    # Joint 4 rotates about the Y-axis
    adjusted_pz = adjusted_pz - d3
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_px, adjusted_pz)

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This revised implementation will be tested against the provided feedback to ensure it produces the correct joint values. If further adjustments are needed, I will refine the logic accordingly.
