The feedback indicates that the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles to reach the target positions and orientations. The discrepancies suggest that the relationships between the joints and the target are not being properly accounted for in the calculations. To address this, I will carefully analyze the problem and revise the function step by step.

### Observations from Feedback
1. The positions and orientations reached by the current implementation are significantly off from the targets.
2. The joint angles produced by the current implementation are incorrect compared to the correct joint values.
3. The errors suggest that the transformations and offsets between the joints are not being properly handled.

### Plan for Revision
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Chain**: Ensure that the transformations between the joints are correctly modeled, including the offsets and rotations.
2. **Decompose the Problem**: Solve for each joint angle sequentially, taking into account the contributions of the previous joints.
3. **Incorporate Orientation**: Use the target orientation to solve for the final joint angles, ensuring that the TCP aligns with the desired orientation.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Link lengths and offsets
    d1 = 0.39225  # Offset for Joint 2
    d2 = 0.093    # Offset for Joint 3
    d3 = 0.09465  # Offset for Joint 4
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # TCP offset along Y-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for Joint 1 (Revolute 1)
    # Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for Joint 2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset of Joint 1
    adjusted_pz = pz - d1 * math.cos(theta1)
    adjusted_px = px - d1 * math.sin(theta1)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_px, adjusted_pz)

    # Step 3: Solve for Joint 3 (Revolute 3)
    # Joint 3 rotates about the Z-axis
    adjusted_py = py - d2
    theta3 = math.atan2(adjusted_py, adjusted_px)

    # Step 4: Solve for Joint 4 (Revolute 4)
    # Joint 4 rotates about the Y-axis
    adjusted_pz = adjusted_pz - d3
    theta4 = math.atan2(adjusted_px, adjusted_pz)

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This revised implementation will be tested against the provided feedback to ensure it produces the correct joint values. If further adjustments are needed, I will refine the logic accordingly.
