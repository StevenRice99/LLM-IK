To solve the inverse kinematics for the 4-DOF manipulator, we will break the problem into steps, leveraging the existing solutions for sub-chains and the given details.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1):**  
   Use the position of the target `p` to calculate the angle for Joint 1. This involves projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and using the `atan2` function to compute the angle. This is already solved in **Existing Code 1**.

2. **Joint 2 (Revolute 2):**  
   After determining Joint 1, use the updated position to calculate the angle for Joint 2. This is similar to Joint 1 and is solved in **Existing Code 2**.

3. **Joints 3 and 4 (Revolute 3 and 4):**  
   Use the remaining position and orientation to calculate the angles for Joints 3 and 4. This is solved in **Existing Code 3**.

4. **Combine Results:**  
   Combine the results from the above steps to return the joint angles for all four joints.

Now, I will proceed to implement the solution in the provided function.
