The forward kinematics results indicate that the position and orientation of the TCP do not match the target position and orientation provided in the feedback. This suggests that the inverse kinematics solution for Joint 1 (Revolute 1) is incorrect or incomplete. 

### Observations:
1. The position of the TCP after setting Joint 1 to `0.7861720206813361` does not align with the target position `[0.198520459348578, 0.023288298260589, 0.209160970447298]`.
2. The orientation of the TCP also does not match the target orientation `[1.7291348576363692, 0.536596316979978, -1.400654174599393]`.

### Next Steps:
To debug and refine the solution, I will:
1. Revisit the calculation for Joint 1 and ensure that the projection onto the XZ-plane and the use of `atan2` are correct.
2. Adjust the subsequent calculations for Joints 2, 3, and 4 based on the corrected Joint 1 value.

Let me refine the solution for Joint 1.
To refine the solution for Joint 1, I will revisit the calculation and ensure that the projection onto the XZ-plane and the use of `atan2` are correct. The target position `[0.198520459348578, 0.023288298260589, 0.209160970447298]` will be used to compute the correct angle for Joint 1.

The angle for Joint 1 is determined by projecting the target position onto the XZ-plane and using the `atan2` function. Specifically:
- The X and Z coordinates of the target position are used to compute the angle.

Let me compute the correct value for Joint 1.
