To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) that allow the robot to reach the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions and orientations of each link. The TCP position is influenced by the joint angles and the link transformations. The TCP position is given as:
\[ \text{TCP Position} = [x_\text{TCP}, y_\text{TCP}, z_\text{TCP}] \]
\[ \text{TCP Orientation} = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \]

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The robot has 4 revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**: Rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**: Rotates about the Y-axis.
3. **Revolute 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**: Rotates about the Z-axis.
4. **Revolute 4 (\( \theta_4 \))**: Rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position and orientation are determined by the cumulative transformations of these joints.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint (\( \theta_1 \)) determines the rotation about the Y-axis. Since the TCP position is given, we can use the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane to solve for \( \theta_1 \).

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The second joint (\( \theta_2 \)) also rotates about the Y-axis. Using the target position and the known link lengths, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \) using trigonometric relationships.

### Step 5: Solve for \( \theta_3 \)
The third joint (\( \theta_3 \)) rotates about the Z-axis. The orientation of the TCP provides information about \( \theta_3 \).

### Step 6: Solve for \( \theta_4 \)
The fourth joint (\( \theta_4 \)) rotates about the Y-axis. The final orientation of the TCP is determined by \( \theta_4 \).

### Step 7: Implement the Solution
Using the above steps, we can write the Python function to compute the joint angles.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.39225  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.093    # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3
    L4 = 0.0823   # Length of TCP offset

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(y, x)

    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis)
    d = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Distance in the XY-plane
    z_offset = z - L1         # Adjust for the height of link 1
    theta2 = np.arctan2(z_offset, d)

    # Solve for theta3 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta3 = r_z - np.pi / 2  # Adjust for the TCP orientation

    # Solve for theta4 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta4 = r_y

    return theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4 \) based on the target position and orientation.
