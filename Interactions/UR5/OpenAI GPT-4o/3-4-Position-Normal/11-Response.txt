The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still failing to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issue seems to be with the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), as the TCP positions are consistently incorrect. Additionally, the second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is often computed as \( \pi \), which is incorrect for many cases.

---

### Step 1: Reanalyze the Problem
The manipulator has two revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1 (Joint 1)** rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2 (Joint 2)** rotates about the Z-axis.

The TCP position is determined by the combined effects of these rotations and the fixed link offsets. The forward kinematics equations must be inverted correctly to compute the joint angles.

#### Observations from Feedback
1. The TCP positions are consistently incorrect, indicating that the geometry of the manipulator is not being handled correctly.
2. The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is often computed as \( \pi \), which is incorrect for many cases. This suggests that the calculation of \( \theta_2 \) is flawed.

---

### Step 2: Correct the Approach
The key issue lies in the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). The current implementation does not correctly account for the geometry of the manipulator, particularly the offsets between the links.

#### Correct Geometry Analysis
1. **TCP Position**:
   The TCP position \( p = (x, y, z) \) is given in the global coordinate frame. The manipulator's geometry and joint rotations determine how this position is reached.

2. **Revolute 1 (Joint 1)**:
   - Rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.

3. **Revolute 2 (Joint 2)**:
   - Rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Affects the X and Y coordinates of the TCP.

4. **Link Offsets**:
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Z-axis: \( 0.09465 \).
   - Revolute 2 is offset from Revolute 1 by a fixed distance along the Y-axis: \( 0.093 \).

#### Correct Inverse Kinematics Equations
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position can be expressed as:
\[
x = r \cos(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = r \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1) + 0.093
\]
\[
z = r \cos(\theta_1) + 0.09465
\]
where \( r \) is the distance from Revolute 2 to the TCP in the XY-plane.

To solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \):
1. Compute \( r \) as the distance from the origin to the TCP in the XZ-plane:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}
   \]

2. Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the Z-coordinate equation:
   \[
   \cos(\theta_1) = \frac{z - 0.09465}{r}
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta_1) = \frac{x}{r}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2\left(\sin(\theta_1), \cos(\theta_1)\right)
   \]

3. Solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the X and Y coordinates:
   \[
   \tan(\theta_2) = \frac{y - 0.093}{x}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan2(y - 0.093, x)
   \]

---

### Step 3: Implement the Corrected Solution
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Distance from the origin to the TCP in the XZ-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + (z - 0.09465)**2)
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    cos_theta_1 = (z - 0.09465) / r
    sin_theta_1 = x / r
    theta_1 = math.atan2(sin_theta_1, cos_theta_1)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    theta_2 = math.atan2(y - 0.093, x)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

---

### Step 4: Explanation of Changes
1. **Correct Geometry**:
   - The calculation of \( r \) now correctly accounts for the Z-offset of the TCP (\( 0.09465 \)).
   - The equations for \( \cos(\theta_1) \) and \( \sin(\theta_1) \) are derived from the correct geometry of the manipulator.

2. **Use of `atan2`**:
   - The `atan2` function is used to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to ensure the correct quadrant is selected.

3. **Simplified Logic**:
   - The calculation of \( \theta_2 \) is simplified to directly use the X and Y coordinates.

---

### Step 5: Testing
This corrected implementation should now produce the correct joint angles for all valid inputs. If the manipulator still fails to reach the target positions, further debugging will be required to verify the forward kinematics and the geometry of the manipulator.
