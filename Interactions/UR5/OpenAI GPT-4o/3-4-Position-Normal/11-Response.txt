The forward kinematics results confirm that the TCP position is correctly reached when the first joint (\( \theta_1 \)) is set to \(-1.39296489815784\) and the second joint (\( \theta_2 \)) is \( 0 \). This indicates that the issue lies in the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) in the inverse kinematics function.

### Observations:
1. The TCP position depends only on the rotation of the first joint (\( \theta_1 \)) about the Y-axis.
2. The second joint (\( \theta_2 \)) does not contribute to the TCP position in this configuration, as it is always \( 0 \).
3. The current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrectly calculating \( \theta_1 \), leading to incorrect TCP positions.

### Correcting the Calculation of \( \theta_1 \):
The TCP position is determined by the rotation of the first joint (\( \theta_1 \)) about the Y-axis. To calculate \( \theta_1 \), we need to consider the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane. The angle \( \theta_1 \) can be calculated using the arctangent function:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(-x, z)
\]
Here:
- \( x \) is the X-coordinate of the target position.
- \( z \) is the Z-coordinate of the target position.
- The negative sign for \( x \) accounts for the rotation about the Y-axis.

### Updated Code:
Here is the corrected implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(-x, z)
    
    # Theta_2 is always 0 in this configuration
    theta_2 = 0
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Corrected Calculation of \( \theta_1 \):**
   - Used the arctangent function to calculate \( \theta_1 \) based on the projection of the target position onto the X-Z plane.
   - Included the negative sign for \( x \) to account for the rotation about the Y-axis.

2. **Simplified Solution:**
   - Removed unnecessary calculations for \( \theta_2 \), as it is always \( 0 \) in this configuration.

### Why This Works:
- The arctangent function correctly calculates the angle \( \theta_1 \) required to align the TCP with the target position in the X-Z plane.
- The second joint (\( \theta_2 \)) does not contribute to the TCP position, so it is set to \( 0 \).

This updated code should now produce the correct joint angles for all valid target positions.
