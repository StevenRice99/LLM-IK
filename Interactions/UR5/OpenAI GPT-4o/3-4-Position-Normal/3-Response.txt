To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Kinematic Structure**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Z-axis.

2. **Forward Kinematics**:
   Using the given link positions and orientations:
   - Revolute 1 contributes a rotation about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 contributes a rotation about the Z-axis and a translation along the Z-axis.

3. **Target Position**:
   The target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) must be expressed in terms of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

4. **Equations**:
   From the forward kinematics:
   - The TCP position is determined by the combined effects of the two rotations and the fixed link offsets.

5. **Solution**:
   To solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we will:
   - Use trigonometric relationships to express the target position in terms of the joint angles.
   - Solve the resulting equations analytically.

Let me now proceed to derive the closed-form solution for the inverse kinematics.
To derive the closed-form solution for the inverse kinematics, we will analyze the geometry of the manipulator and solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

### Step 1: Define the TCP Position
The TCP position \( p = (x, y, z) \) is given in the global coordinate frame. The manipulator's geometry and joint rotations determine how this position is reached.

### Step 2: Geometry of the Manipulator
1. **Revolute 1 (Joint 1)**:
   - Rotates about the Y-axis.
   - This rotation affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.

2. **Revolute 2 (Joint 2)**:
   - Rotates about the Z-axis.
   - This rotation affects the X and Y coordinates of the TCP.

3. **Link Offsets**:
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Z-axis: \( 0.09465 \).
   - Revolute 2 is offset from Revolute 1 by a fixed distance along the Y-axis: \( 0.093 \).

### Step 3: Forward Kinematics Equations
From the forward kinematics, the position of the TCP can be expressed as:
\[
x = r \cos(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = r \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1) + 0.093
\]
\[
z = r \cos(\theta_1) + 0.09465
\]
where \( r \) is the distance from Revolute 2 to the TCP in the XY-plane.

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)
1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**:
   From the Z-coordinate equation:
   \[
   z - 0.09465 = r \cos(\theta_1)
   \]
   \[
   \cos(\theta_1) = \frac{z - 0.09465}{r}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arccos\left(\frac{z - 0.09465}{r}\right)
   \]

2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   From the X and Y coordinates:
   \[
   \tan(\theta_2) = \frac{y - 0.093}{x}
   \]
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan2(y - 0.093, x)
   \]

### Step 5: Implement the Solution
We now implement the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP in the XY-plane
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + (y - 0.093)**2)
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.acos((z - 0.09465) / r)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    theta_2 = math.atan2(y - 0.093, x)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \).
