To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Kinematic Structure**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Z-axis.

2. **Forward Kinematics**:
   Using the given link positions and orientations:
   - Revolute 1 contributes a rotation about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 contributes a rotation about the Z-axis and a translation along the Z-axis.

3. **Target Position**:
   The target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) must be expressed in terms of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

4. **Equations**:
   - The TCP position can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     y = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     where:
     - \( L_1 = 0.093 \) (distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along Z-axis),
     - \( L_2 = 0.09465 \) (distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis).

5. **Solving for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - From the \( x \) and \( y \) equations, we can solve for \( \theta_1 \):
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
     \]
   - From the \( z \) equation, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \):
     \[
     \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{z - L_1}{L_2}
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{z - L_1}{L_2}\right)
     \]

### Implementation:
Using the above equations, we can now complete the Python function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.093  # Distance from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2 along Z-axis
    L2 = 0.09465  # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Z-axis
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    cos_theta_2 = (z - L1) / L2
    theta_2 = math.acos(cos_theta_2)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the given target position \( p \).
