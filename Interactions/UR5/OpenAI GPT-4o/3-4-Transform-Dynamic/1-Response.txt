To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) that position the tool center point (TCP) at the desired position `p` and orientation `r`. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Understand the Kinematic Chain
- **Revolute Joint 1 (θ1)**: Rotates about the Y-axis.
- **Revolute Joint 2 (θ2)**: Rotates about the Z-axis.
- **TCP**: Positioned at `[0, 0, 0.09465]` relative to the last joint.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
The forward kinematics for this manipulator can be expressed as:
1. Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis, affecting the X and Z coordinates.
2. Joint 2 rotates about the Z-axis, affecting the X and Y coordinates.

The position of the TCP in the global frame can be derived as:
\[
\begin{aligned}
x &= L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1), \\
y &= L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1), \\
z &= L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2),
\end{aligned}
\]
where:
- \(L_1 = 0.093\) (distance from Joint 1 to Joint 2),
- \(L_2 = 0.09465\) (distance from Joint 2 to TCP).

### Step 3: Solve for θ1 and θ2
Given the target position `p = (px, py, pz)`, we solve for θ1 and θ2:
1. **Solve for θ1**:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(py, px)
   \]
   This determines the rotation about the Y-axis to align the TCP in the X-Y plane.

2. **Solve for θ2**:
   Using the projection of the TCP in the X-Z plane:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{px^2 + py^2}, \quad \theta_2 = \arctan2(r, pz - L_1)
   \]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
Here is the Python implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    L1 = 0.093  # Distance from Joint 1 to Joint 2
    L2 = 0.09465  # Distance from Joint 2 to TCP

    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(py, px)

    # Solve for θ2
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)  # Projection in the X-Y plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, pz - L1)

    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles θ1 and θ2 required to position the TCP at the desired position `p`. Note that the orientation `r` is not explicitly used because the manipulator's degrees of freedom only allow for positioning, not orientation control.
