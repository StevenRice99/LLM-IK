To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (Revolute 2) that position the tool center point (TCP) at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the manipulator structure
- **Revolute 1 (Joint 1)** rotates about the Y-axis.
- **Revolute 2 (Joint 2)** rotates about the Z-axis.
- The TCP is offset from the second joint by a fixed distance along the Z-axis.

### Step 2: Forward kinematics equations
The forward kinematics of the manipulator can be expressed as:
1. Rotation by \( \theta_1 \) about the Y-axis (Revolute 1).
2. Translation along the Y-axis by 0.093 (link offset).
3. Rotation by \( \theta_2 \) about the Z-axis (Revolute 2).
4. Translation along the Z-axis by 0.09465 (TCP offset).

The position of the TCP in the base frame is:
\[
\begin{aligned}
x &= \cos(\theta_1) \cdot \cos(\theta_2) \cdot 0.09465, \\
y &= 0.093 + \sin(\theta_2) \cdot 0.09465, \\
z &= \sin(\theta_1) \cdot \cos(\theta_2) \cdot 0.09465.
\end{aligned}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)
1. From the given position \( p = [x, y, z] \), we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) using:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(z, x).
   \]
2. Using \( y \), we can solve for \( \theta_2 \) by isolating it in the forward kinematics equation:
   \[
   \sin(\theta_2) = \frac{y - 0.093}{0.09465}.
   \]
   Then:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{y - 0.093}{0.09465}\right).
   \]

### Step 4: Implement the solution
We now implement the above equations in the Python function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2
    sin_theta2 = (y - 0.093) / 0.09465
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Input**: The function takes the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \). However, since the manipulator does not have orientation constraints, \( r \) is not used in the calculations.
2. **Output**: The function returns the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) in radians.
3. **Assumptions**: The target position is reachable, and the manipulator's physical constraints are respected.

This solution provides the closed-form analytical inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator.
