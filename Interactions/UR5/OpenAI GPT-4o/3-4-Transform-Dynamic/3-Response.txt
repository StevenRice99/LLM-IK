The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect. The joint angles calculated by the function do not produce the desired positions and orientations. This suggests that the mathematical model used to compute the joint angles is flawed or incomplete.

### Observations from Feedback
1. The positions reached by the manipulator are incorrect, which means the forward kinematics equations used to compute the joint angles are not properly inverted.
2. The orientations reached are also incorrect, which suggests that the orientation component of the inverse kinematics is not being handled correctly.
3. The joint angles produced by the function are significantly different from the correct joint angles, indicating a fundamental issue in the calculations.

### Analysis of the Problem
The manipulator has two revolute joints:
- **Joint 1 (θ1)** rotates about the Y-axis.
- **Joint 2 (θ2)** rotates about the Z-axis.

The forward kinematics equations for the manipulator must be inverted to compute the joint angles. The feedback suggests that the current implementation does not correctly account for the relationship between the joint angles and the target position/orientation.

### Plan to Fix the Issue
1. **Revisit the Forward Kinematics**: Derive the correct forward kinematics equations for the manipulator.
2. **Invert the Forward Kinematics**: Use the correct equations to compute the joint angles (θ1 and θ2) from the target position and orientation.
3. **Test the Solution**: Ensure that the computed joint angles produce the desired position and orientation.

### Updated Approach
The forward kinematics equations for the manipulator are:
\[
\begin{aligned}
x &= L_2 \cos(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1), \\
y &= L_2 \cos(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1), \\
z &= L_1 + L_2 \sin(\theta_2),
\end{aligned}
\]
where:
- \(L_1 = 0.093\) (distance from Joint 1 to Joint 2),
- \(L_2 = 0.09465\) (distance from Joint 2 to TCP).

To compute the joint angles:
1. **Solve for θ1**:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
   \]
   This determines the rotation about the Y-axis to align the TCP in the X-Y plane.

2. **Solve for θ2**:
   Using the projection of the TCP in the X-Z plane:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \quad \theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{z - L_1}{L_2}\right)
   \]

### Implementation
Here is the corrected Python implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    L1 = 0.093  # Distance from Joint 1 to Joint 2
    L2 = 0.09465  # Distance from Joint 2 to TCP

    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(py, px)

    # Solve for θ2
    r = math.sqrt(px**2 + py**2)  # Projection in the X-Y plane
    if abs((pz - L1) / L2) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach.")
    theta2 = math.asin((pz - L1) / L2)

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Corrected Forward Kinematics**: The forward kinematics equations were revisited and corrected to properly account for the manipulator's geometry.
2. **Inverted the Equations**: The equations were inverted to compute the joint angles from the target position.
3. **Error Handling**: Added a check to ensure that the target position is within the manipulator's reach.

This implementation should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target position and orientation.
