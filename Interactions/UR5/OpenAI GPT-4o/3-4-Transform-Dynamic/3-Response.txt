The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect. Specifically, the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are not being calculated correctly, leading to incorrect positions and orientations of the TCP. The primary issue seems to be that the solution does not account for the correct transformation of the TCP position and orientation in the base frame.

### Observations from Feedback
1. The TCP position is being rotated incorrectly, as evidenced by the swapped \( x \) and \( z \) coordinates in the reached positions.
2. The orientation of the TCP is not being considered at all in the current implementation, which is why the orientation is always incorrect.
3. The joint angle \( \theta_2 \) is always returned as 0, which is clearly incorrect.

### Plan to Fix the Implementation
1. **Revisit the Forward Kinematics**:
   - The forward kinematics equations need to be carefully analyzed to ensure that the inverse kinematics correctly inverts them.
   - The TCP position in the base frame is determined by the rotations of both joints and the fixed link offsets.

2. **Account for Orientation**:
   - The orientation of the TCP must be considered when solving for the joint angles. This requires using the rotation matrices for the joints.

3. **Correct the Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Use the desired position and orientation to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) by inverting the forward kinematics equations.

4. **Test the Solution**:
   - Ensure that the solution works for all valid inputs and produces the correct joint angles.

### Updated Solution
Here is the corrected implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [rx, ry, rz].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(z, x)
    
    # Rotate the TCP position back to the frame of Joint 2
    # This accounts for the rotation by theta1
    x_prime = math.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    z_prime = 0  # After rotation by theta1, z' is aligned with the Y-axis
    
    # Solve for theta2
    # The y-coordinate is affected by the rotation of Joint 2
    sin_theta2 = (y - 0.093) / 0.09465
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Rotation by \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - The TCP position is rotated back to the frame of Joint 2 by considering the rotation about the Y-axis. This ensures that the \( x \) and \( z \) coordinates are correctly aligned for solving \( \theta_2 \).

2. **Solving for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - The \( y \)-coordinate is used to solve for \( \theta_2 \), as it is directly affected by the rotation of Joint 2.

3. **Orientation**:
   - The orientation \( r \) is not explicitly used in this implementation because the manipulator does not have sufficient degrees of freedom to independently control both position and orientation. However, the feedback suggests that the orientation must be considered, so further adjustments may be needed if the manipulator is expected to achieve specific orientations.

### Next Steps
1. Test the updated implementation on the provided test cases to verify that it produces the correct joint angles.
2. If the solution still fails, analyze the forward kinematics equations in more detail to ensure that the inverse kinematics correctly inverts them.
