The forward kinematics results confirm the following:
1. The position of the TCP is consistent with the target position provided in the feedback.
2. The orientation of the TCP matches the target orientation provided in the feedback.
3. The joint angles used in this forward kinematics calculation are \( \theta_1 = -1.392964779093036 \) and \( \theta_2 = 0.774078871620946 \), which are the correct joint values for this target.

### Observations:
- The forward kinematics results validate that the correct joint angles produce the desired TCP position and orientation.
- The issue in the inverse kinematics function lies in the calculation of \( \theta_2 \), as it does not properly account for the orientation of the TCP.

### Plan to Fix the Inverse Kinematics:
1. **Revisit the Orientation Calculation**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
   - Use the target orientation to compute \( \theta_2 \) more accurately.

2. **Incorporate the Forward Kinematics Results**:
   - Use the forward kinematics results to verify the relationship between \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and the TCP orientation.

3. **Update the Inverse Kinematics Function**:
   - Adjust the calculation of \( \theta_2 \) to ensure it aligns with the target orientation.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.
Here is the revised implementation of the inverse kinematics function, incorporating the feedback and addressing the issues with the calculation of \( \theta_2 \):

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis, so we use the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the rotation of Revolute 1
    # The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, 0, 0.09465] in the local frame
    # The position of Revolute 2 in the global frame is [0, 0.093, 0]
    # Transform the target position into the frame of Revolute 2
    # Rotate the target position by -theta1 about the Y-axis
    x_prime = math.cos(-theta1) * px - math.sin(-theta1) * pz
    z_prime = math.sin(-theta1) * px + math.cos(-theta1) * pz
    y_prime = py - 0.093  # Subtract the Y-offset of Revolute 2

    # The TCP offset in the Z-direction is 0.09465
    z_prime -= 0.09465

    # Solve for theta2 using the orientation constraints
    # The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both theta1 and theta2
    # Use the target orientation (r) to compute the correct value for theta2
    theta2 = rz - theta1  # Adjust theta2 to account for the rotation of theta1

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Incorporated Orientation**:
   - The second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) is now adjusted to account for the rotation of the first joint (\( \theta_1 \)).
   - Specifically, \( \theta_2 \) is calculated as \( \text{rz} - \theta_1 \), where \( \text{rz} \) is the target yaw angle of the TCP.

2. **Adjusted Position Calculation**:
   - The position of the TCP is adjusted to account for the fixed offset relative to Revolute 2.
   - The target position is transformed into the frame of Revolute 2 by rotating it by \(-\theta_1\) about the Y-axis.

3. **Simplified Orientation Handling**:
   - The yaw angle (\( \text{rz} \)) is directly used to compute \( \theta_2 \), simplifying the calculation.

This updated implementation should correctly compute the joint angles for both position and orientation of the TCP.
