The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still not correctly solving for the joint angles, particularly the second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)). The primary issue lies in the way the orientation of the TCP is being handled. The second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) must account for both the position and orientation of the TCP, but the current implementation does not fully incorporate the orientation constraints.

### Observations:
1. The position errors are minimal, indicating that the first joint angle (\( \theta_1 \)) is being calculated correctly.
2. The orientation errors are significant, suggesting that the second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) is not being computed correctly.
3. The feedback provides the correct joint values for various test cases, which can be used to refine the solution.

### Plan to Fix:
1. **Revisit the Orientation Calculation**: The orientation of the TCP must be explicitly considered when solving for \( \theta_2 \). This involves using the target orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \) to compute the correct angle.
2. **Incorporate the Target Orientation**: Use the target orientation \( r \) to adjust the calculation of \( \theta_2 \), ensuring that the TCP aligns with the desired orientation.
3. **Refine the Position Calculation**: Ensure that the position constraints are fully satisfied by adjusting the calculation of \( \theta_2 \).

### Updated Approach:
- Use the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) to compute \( \theta_1 \) as before.
- Use both the target position and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \) to compute \( \theta_2 \), ensuring that the TCP aligns with the desired orientation.

Let me refine the solution to address these issues. Here's the updated implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Adjust for the offset of the second link and TCP
    l2 = 0.093  # Length of the second link
    tcp_offset = 0.09465  # TCP offset along Z-axis
    
    # Effective position of the TCP in the local frame of Revolute 2
    effective_z = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2) - tcp_offset
    effective_x = py - l2  # Adjust for the link length along Y-axis
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the target orientation
    theta2 = rz  # Directly use the target orientation about Z-axis
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated implementation incorporates the target orientation \( r \) to compute \( \theta_2 \). Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
