To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \). Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Z-axis.

2. **Break Down the Problem**:
   - First, solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the projection of the target position \( p \) onto the XZ-plane.
   - Then, solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the remaining geometry after accounting for \( \theta_1 \).

3. **Use the Existing Solution**:
   - The provided solution for a single link calculates \( \theta_1 \) using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates of the target position.

4. **Extend to the Full Chain**:
   - After determining \( \theta_1 \), use the geometry of the second link and the TCP offset to calculate \( \theta_2 \).

Now, I will complete the Python function for the inverse kinematics solution.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    px, py, pz = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis, so we use the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the rotation of Revolute 1
    # The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, 0, 0.09465] in the local frame
    # The position of Revolute 2 in the global frame is [0, 0.093, 0]
    # Transform the target position into the frame of Revolute 2
    # Rotate the target position by -theta1 about the Y-axis
    x_prime = math.cos(-theta1) * px - math.sin(-theta1) * pz
    z_prime = math.sin(-theta1) * px + math.cos(-theta1) * pz
    y_prime = py - 0.093  # Subtract the Y-offset of Revolute 2

    # The TCP offset in the Z-direction is 0.09465
    z_prime -= 0.09465

    # Now solve for theta2 using the arctangent of the adjusted X and Z coordinates
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_prime, z_prime)

    return theta1, theta2
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \). It uses trigonometric relationships and the geometry of the manipulator to determine the angles.
