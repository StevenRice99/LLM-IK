The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is failing to compute the correct joint angles for the second joint (\( \theta_2 \)). Specifically, the second joint angle is consistently being returned as \( \pi \) (3.141592653589793), which is incorrect. This suggests that the calculation for \( \theta_2 \) is not properly accounting for the orientation of the TCP.

### Observations from Feedback:
1. The first joint angle (\( \theta_1 \)) is close to the correct value but may have minor inaccuracies due to numerical precision.
2. The second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) is consistently incorrect, always returning \( \pi \).
3. The orientation of the TCP is not being properly handled in the current implementation.

### Plan to Fix the Issues:
1. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - The second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) must account for both the position and orientation of the TCP.
   - The orientation of the TCP is defined by the roll, pitch, and yaw angles (\( r = [rx, ry, rz] \)).

2. **Incorporate Orientation**:
   - Use the orientation of the TCP to compute the correct value for \( \theta_2 \).
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), so we need to solve for \( \theta_2 \) using both position and orientation constraints.

3. **Update the Calculation for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Use the target orientation (\( r \)) to compute the correct value for \( \theta_2 \).
   - Ensure that the calculation accounts for the fixed offset of the TCP relative to Revolute 2.

4. **Test the Updated Function**:
   - Ensure that the updated function produces the correct joint angles for all test cases.

I will now revise the function to address these issues.
Here is the revised implementation of the inverse kinematics function, incorporating the feedback and addressing the issues with the calculation of \( \theta_2 \):

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis, so we use the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the rotation of Revolute 1
    # The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by [0, 0, 0.09465] in the local frame
    # The position of Revolute 2 in the global frame is [0, 0.093, 0]
    # Transform the target position into the frame of Revolute 2
    # Rotate the target position by -theta1 about the Y-axis
    x_prime = math.cos(-theta1) * px - math.sin(-theta1) * pz
    z_prime = math.sin(-theta1) * px + math.cos(-theta1) * pz
    y_prime = py - 0.093  # Subtract the Y-offset of Revolute 2

    # The TCP offset in the Z-direction is 0.09465
    z_prime -= 0.09465

    # Solve for theta2 using the orientation constraints
    # The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both theta1 and theta2
    # Use the target orientation (r) to compute the correct value for theta2
    theta2 = rz  # Directly use the target orientation around the Z-axis

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Incorporated Orientation**:
   - The second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) is now directly influenced by the target orientation (\( r \)).
   - Specifically, the yaw angle (\( rz \)) of the target orientation is used to compute \( \theta_2 \).

2. **Adjusted Position Calculation**:
   - The position of the TCP is adjusted to account for the fixed offset relative to Revolute 2.
   - The target position is transformed into the frame of Revolute 2 by rotating it by \(-\theta_1\) about the Y-axis.

3. **Simplified Orientation Handling**:
   - The yaw angle (\( rz \)) is directly used to compute \( \theta_2 \), simplifying the calculation.

This updated implementation should correctly compute the joint angles for both position and orientation of the TCP.
