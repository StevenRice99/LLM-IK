To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Kinematic Chain
1. **Revolute 1** rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2** rotates about the Z-axis.
3. The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Z-axis.

### Step 2: Use the Provided Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is:
\[
\text{TCP Position} = [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
\]
This confirms the structure of the manipulator.

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint, Revolute 1, rotates about the Y-axis. The rotation affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP. Using the provided sub-chain solution:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The second joint, Revolute 2, rotates about the Z-axis. After accounting for the rotation of Revolute 1, the remaining position offset along the Z-axis is due to Revolute 2. The length of the second link is \( 0.093 \), and the TCP offset is \( 0.09465 \). Using trigonometry, we can solve for \( \theta_2 \).

### Step 5: Implement the Solution
Here is the Python implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    px, py, pz = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Adjust for the offset of the second link and TCP
    d = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)  # Distance in the XZ plane
    l2 = 0.093  # Length of the second link
    tcp_offset = 0.09465  # TCP offset along Z-axis
    
    # Effective length along Z-axis after accounting for TCP offset
    effective_z = d - tcp_offset
    
    # Solve for theta2 using trigonometry
    theta2 = math.atan2(effective_z, l2)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to position the TCP at the desired location.
