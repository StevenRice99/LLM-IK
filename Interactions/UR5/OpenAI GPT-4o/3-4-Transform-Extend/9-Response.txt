The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) is not being calculated correctly in the current implementation. The issue lies in the way the second joint angle is derived. The orientation of the TCP is not being properly accounted for in the solution.

### Observations:
1. The forward kinematics results show that the TCP position and orientation are influenced by both joint angles (\( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)).
2. The orientation of the TCP is directly affected by the second joint (\( \theta_2 \)), which rotates about the Z-axis.
3. The provided feedback includes correct joint values for various test cases, which can be used to refine the solution.

### Plan to Fix:
1. **Revisit the Orientation Calculation**: The orientation of the TCP must be explicitly considered when solving for \( \theta_2 \). This involves using the target orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \) to compute the correct angle.
2. **Incorporate the Target Orientation**: Use the target orientation \( r \) to adjust the calculation of \( \theta_2 \), ensuring that the TCP aligns with the desired orientation.

### Updated Approach:
- Use the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) to compute \( \theta_1 \) as before.
- Use both the target position and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \) to compute \( \theta_2 \), ensuring that the TCP aligns with the desired orientation.

Let me refine the solution to address these issues. Here's the updated implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    px, py, pz = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Adjust for the offset of the second link and TCP
    l2 = 0.093  # Length of the second link
    tcp_offset = 0.09465  # TCP offset along Z-axis
    
    # Effective position of the TCP in the local frame of Revolute 2
    effective_z = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2) - tcp_offset
    effective_x = py - l2  # Adjust for the link length along Y-axis
    
    # Solve for theta2 using the target orientation
    theta2 = rz  # Directly use the target orientation about Z-axis
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated implementation incorporates the target orientation \( r \) to compute \( \theta_2 \). Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
