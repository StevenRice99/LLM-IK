To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Kinematic Chain
1. **Revolute 1 (Joint 1)** rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2 (Joint 2)** rotates about the Z-axis.
3. The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Z-axis.

### Step 2: Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is determined as:
\[
\text{TCP Position} = \text{Base Position} + \text{Link 1 Offset} + \text{Link 2 Offset}
\]
Given the link offsets:
- Revolute 1 contributes no offset in position.
- Revolute 2 contributes an offset of \( [0, 0.093, 0] \).
- The TCP is further offset by \( [0, 0, 0.09465] \).

Thus, the TCP position in the base frame is:
\[
\text{TCP Position} = [0, 0.093, 0] + [0, 0, 0.09465] = [0, 0.093, 0.09465]
\]

### Step 3: Inverse Kinematics
To solve for the joint angles:
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**: This joint rotates about the Y-axis. The rotation affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP. Using trigonometry:
   \[
   \tan(\theta_1) = \frac{x}{z}
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
   \]

2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**: This joint rotates about the Z-axis. The rotation affects the Y coordinate of the TCP. The effective Y position of the TCP is:
   \[
   y_{\text{effective}} = y - 0.093
   \]
   Using the geometry of the manipulator:
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{y_{\text{effective}}}{0.09465}\right)
   \]

### Step 4: Implement the Solution
Now, I will implement the inverse kinematics function based on the above analysis.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(x, z)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    y_effective = y - 0.093
    theta_2 = math.asin(y_effective / 0.09465)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired location \( p \). Note that the orientation \( r \) is not explicitly used here, as the manipulator's degrees of freedom only allow for positioning the TCP in space.
