The feedback and the forward kinematics results indicate that the current inverse kinematics solution is incomplete. Specifically, the second joint angle (\( \theta_2 \)) is not being calculated correctly, and the orientation of the TCP is not being addressed at all. To address these issues, I will revise the inverse kinematics function to account for both position and orientation.

### Observations from Feedback
1. The TCP position is being reached approximately, but the orientation is not being matched.
2. The second joint (\( \theta_2 \)) is always returned as 0, which is incorrect.
3. The correct joint values provided in the feedback show that both joints contribute to achieving the desired orientation.

### Revised Approach
To solve for both position and orientation:
1. **Position**: Use the TCP position to calculate the joint angles as before, but ensure that both joints contribute to the solution.
2. **Orientation**: Use the desired orientation to calculate the joint angles that align the TCP with the target orientation.

### Steps to Solve
1. **Position Analysis**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by both joints. The first joint (\( \theta_1 \)) rotates about the Y-axis, and the second joint (\( \theta_2 \)) rotates about the Z-axis.
   - The position of the TCP can be expressed as a function of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \). Using trigonometry, we can solve for these angles.

2. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the combined rotations of both joints.
   - The desired orientation can be expressed as a rotation matrix or Euler angles. By comparing the desired orientation with the current orientation, we can solve for the joint angles.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use the position equations to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
   - Use the orientation equations to refine the values of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to incorporate these considerations.

    R2 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta_2), -math.sin(theta_2), 0],

    R_current = R1 @ R2

    # Compare R_current with R_desired to refine theta_1 and theta_2
    # Extract the angles from the rotation matrix
    theta_1_refined = math.atan2(R_desired[2, 0], R_desired[2, 2])
    theta_2_refined = math.atan2(R_desired[0, 1], R_desired[1, 1])

    return theta_1_refined, theta_2_refined
```

This revised function incorporates both position and orientation into the calculation of the joint angles. It uses the desired orientation to refine the joint angles calculated from the position.
