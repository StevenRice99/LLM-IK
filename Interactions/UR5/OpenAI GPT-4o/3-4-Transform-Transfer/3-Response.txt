To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to consider the rotational axes and the target orientation. The provided forward kinematics result shows that the TCP's orientation remains constant at [0, 0, 0] regardless of the joint angles. This implies that the orientation of the TCP is not influenced by the joint rotations, and the inverse kinematics solution for orientation is trivial.

I will now complete the `inverse_kinematics` function to solve for both position and orientation.

### Analysis:
1. **Position**:
   - The existing solution for position calculates `theta1` based on the x and z coordinates of the target position using `atan2`.
   - `theta2` is set to 0.0 because the second joint does not affect the x-z plane position.

2. **Orientation**:
   - Since the TCP's orientation is always [0, 0, 0], the joint angles do not need to be adjusted to achieve a specific orientation. Thus, the orientation component of the inverse kinematics is already satisfied.

### Final Solution:
The function will return the same joint angles as the position-only solution, as the orientation is constant and does not require additional computation.

Here is the completed function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    px, py, pz = p
    # Solve for position
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    theta2 = 0.0  # Orientation is constant, so no adjustment needed for theta2
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
```

This solution satisfies both the position and orientation requirements for the given manipulator.
