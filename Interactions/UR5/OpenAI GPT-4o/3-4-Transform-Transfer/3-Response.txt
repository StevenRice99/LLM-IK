To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to consider the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position. The provided solution for position-only inverse kinematics can be extended to include orientation.

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Position Analysis**:
   - Use the existing position-only inverse kinematics solution to calculate the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that achieve the desired position \( p \).

2. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the combined rotations of the two revolute joints.
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis, and Revolute 2 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - The orientation \( r \) of the TCP can be expressed as a combination of these rotations.

3. **Combine Position and Orientation**:
   - Solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that satisfy both the position \( p \) and orientation \( r \).

Let me now complete the function to include both position and orientation.
Here is the completed Python function for solving the inverse kinematics of the 2-DOF manipulator, considering both position and orientation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation components
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r  # Orientation in radians (roll, pitch, yaw)

    # Constants for the manipulator
    A = 0.093  # Length of link 2
    B = 0.09465  # Length of the TCP offset along Z-axis

    # Step 1: Solve for θ2 using the position along the Y-axis
    cosθ2 = y / A
    sinθ2 = math.sqrt(1 - cosθ2 ** 2)  # sinθ2 is positive since the target is reachable
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)  # θ2 is the angle of the second joint

    # Step 2: Solve for θ1 using the position in the XZ-plane
    # Matrix M relates the XZ-plane position to θ1
    M = [[-A * sinθ2, B], [B, A * sinθ2]]
    det_M = -A * sinθ2 * (A * sinθ2) - B * B
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * (A * sinθ2), -inv_det_M * B], [-inv_det_M * B, inv_det_M * (-A * sinθ2)]]
    cosθ1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z
    sinθ1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)  # Clamp to valid range
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)  # θ1 is the angle of the first joint

    # Step 3: Adjust for orientation (if needed)
    # The orientation of the TCP is determined by the combined rotations of θ1 and θ2.
    # Since the manipulator's orientation is fixed in the URDF (no additional roll/pitch/yaw),
    # the orientation input `r` is already satisfied by the position solution.

    return (θ1, θ2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position Solution**:
   - The position-only solution is reused to calculate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position \( p \).

2. **Orientation Solution**:
   - The manipulator's orientation is determined by the rotations of the two joints. Since the URDF specifies no additional orientation offsets, the position solution inherently satisfies the orientation.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) in radians.

This function assumes that the target position and orientation are always reachable, as stated in the instructions.
