To solve the inverse kinematics for the 3-DOF manipulator, I will now derive the closed-form solution step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the problem
The manipulator has three revolute joints:
1. Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
2. Joint 2 rotates about the Z-axis.
3. Joint 3 rotates about the Y-axis.

The target position of the TCP is given as \( p = (x, y, z) \). The goal is to compute the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at \( p \).

### Step 2: Use forward kinematics to understand the chain
From the forward kinematics:
- The TCP position is \( [0, 0.1753, 0.09465] \) when all joint angles are zero.
- The manipulator's structure is:
  - Link 1: Offset along Y by 0.093.
  - Link 2: Offset along Z by 0.09465.
  - TCP: Offset along Y by 0.0823.

### Step 3: Solve for joint angles
The solution involves:
1. **Joint 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**: Determines the rotation about the Y-axis to align the manipulator with the target in the X-Z plane.
2. **Joint 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**: Determines the rotation about the Z-axis to position the TCP in the Y-Z plane.
3. **Joint 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**: Determines the final rotation about the Y-axis to reach the target.

I will now proceed to implement the solution.
Here is the completed Python function for the inverse kinematics of the 3-DOF manipulator:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    px, py, pz = p

    # Link offsets
    d1 = 0.093  # Offset along Y for Link 1
    d2 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z for Link 2
    d3 = 0.0823  # Offset along Y for TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Project the target position onto the X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the first joint's rotation
    # and the offset of Link 1 along Y
    y_prime = py - d1 - d3  # Adjusted Y position
    z_prime = pz - d2  # Adjusted Z position
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_prime, z_prime)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the first two joints' rotations
    x_prime = px  # X remains unchanged
    z_double_prime = z_prime / math.cos(theta2)  # Adjusted Z position
    theta3 = math.atan2(x_prime, z_double_prime)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Link Offsets**: The offsets \( d1 \), \( d2 \), and \( d3 \) are used to account for the physical dimensions of the manipulator.
2. **Theta1**: The first joint angle is computed by projecting the target position onto the X-Z plane and using the `atan2` function.
3. **Theta2**: The second joint angle is computed by adjusting the target position to account for the first joint's rotation and the offsets along Y and Z.
4. **Theta3**: The third joint angle is computed by further adjusting the target position to account for the rotations of the first two joints.

This function returns the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) in radians.
