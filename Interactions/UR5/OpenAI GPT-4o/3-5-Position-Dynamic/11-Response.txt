The error indicates that the value of `cos_theta3` is outside the valid range for the `math.acos` function, which is \([-1, 1]\). This typically happens due to numerical inaccuracies or incorrect calculations in the cosine rule.

Let's revisit the calculation of `cos_theta3` and ensure it is properly constrained within the valid range.

### Step 1: Revisit the Cosine Rule
The cosine rule is used to calculate the angle \( \theta_3 \):
\[
\cos(\theta_3) = \frac{d^2 - l_1^2 - l_2^2}{2 \cdot l_1 \cdot l_2}
\]
Here:
- \( d \) is the distance from the origin to the target position in the YZ-plane.
- \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \) are the lengths of the second and third links.

If \( \cos(\theta_3) \) is slightly outside the range \([-1, 1]\) due to numerical errors, we need to clamp it to the valid range.

### Step 2: Fix the Code
We will add a clamping step to ensure that `cos_theta3` is always within the valid range. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Effective length in the YZ-plane
    d = math.sqrt(y**2 + z**2)

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.093  # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3

    # Solve for theta3 using the cosine rule
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    # Clamp cos_theta3 to the valid range [-1, 1]
    cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(y, z)
    beta = math.asin((l2 * math.sin(theta3)) / d)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Step 3: Explanation of the Fix
1. **Clamping `cos_theta3`:**
   - The value of `cos_theta3` is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) using:
     ```python
     cos_theta3 = max(-1, min(1, cos_theta3))
     ```
   - This ensures that the `math.acos` function does not encounter a domain error.

2. **No Other Changes:**
   - The rest of the code remains the same, as the error was specifically related to the domain of `math.acos`.

### Step 4: Next Steps
This fix should resolve the `ValueError`. Please test the updated code and let me know if any further issues arise.
