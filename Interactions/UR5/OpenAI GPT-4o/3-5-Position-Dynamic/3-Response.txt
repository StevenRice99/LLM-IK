To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) that position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is:
\[
\text{TCP Position} = [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
\]
This is the result of the combined transformations of the three revolute joints.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The manipulator has three revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1 (θ1)**: Rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2 (θ2)**: Rotates about the Z-axis.
3. **Revolute 3 (θ3)**: Rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by the combined rotations and translations of these joints. We will solve for each joint angle step by step.

### Step 3: Solve for θ1
The first joint (θ1) rotates about the Y-axis. This rotation affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP. Using the provided **Existing Code 1**, we can compute θ1 as:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for θ2
The second joint (θ2) rotates about the Z-axis. This rotation affects the Y coordinate of the TCP. We will compute θ2 by considering the projection of the TCP position onto the Y-axis.

### Step 5: Solve for θ3
The third joint (θ3) rotates about the Y-axis again. This rotation affects the final position of the TCP along the manipulator's axis. We will compute θ3 by considering the remaining distance to the TCP after accounting for θ1 and θ2.

### Step 6: Write the Code
Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Solve for θ2
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by Revolute 2's position
    y_adjusted = y - 0.093
    theta2 = math.atan2(-x, y_adjusted)

    # Solve for θ3
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by Revolute 3's position
    z_adjusted = z - 0.09465
    theta3 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, z_adjusted)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function computes the joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).
