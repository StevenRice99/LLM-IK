The feedback indicates that the revised implementation still fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issue seems to be with the computation of θ1 and θ2, as θ3 is correctly set to 0 in all cases. The incorrect θ1 and θ2 values suggest that the approach to solving for these angles does not properly account for the kinematic chain's geometry and constraints.

### Observations from Feedback
1. **Correct θ3 Values**: The correct solutions consistently have θ3 = 0, and the revised implementation correctly sets θ3 = 0.
2. **Incorrect θ1 and θ2 Values**: The computed θ1 and θ2 values are consistently incorrect, leading to significant errors in the TCP's position.
3. **Systematic Errors**: The errors in θ1 and θ2 suggest that the approach to solving for these angles does not properly account for the manipulator's geometry, particularly the offsets introduced by the joint positions.

### Revised Approach
To address these issues, we need to carefully analyze the kinematic chain and compute the joint angles step by step, ensuring that each joint's contribution to the TCP's position is correctly accounted for.

#### Step 1: Solve for θ1
The first joint (θ1) rotates about the Y-axis. This rotation affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP. To compute θ1, we need to consider the projection of the TCP's position onto the X-Z plane.

#### Step 2: Solve for θ2
The second joint (θ2) rotates about the Z-axis. This rotation affects the Y coordinate of the TCP. To compute θ2, we need to account for the offset introduced by the second joint's position.

#### Step 3: Solve for θ3
The third joint (θ3) rotates about the Y-axis again. Based on the feedback, θ3 does not contribute to the TCP's position in the given scenarios. Therefore, we can set θ3 = 0.

#### Step 4: Implement the Revised Solution
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for θ1
    # θ1 is the angle about the Y-axis that aligns the manipulator with the target in the X-Z plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Solve for θ2
    # Adjust for the offset introduced by Revolute 2's position
    y_adjusted = y - 0.093
    z_adjusted = z - 0.09465
    theta2 = math.atan2(y_adjusted, z_adjusted)

    # Solve for θ3
    # Based on the feedback, θ3 is always 0
    theta3 = 0

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Adjusted θ1 Calculation**: The computation of θ1 has been adjusted to consider the projection of the TCP's position onto the X-Z plane.
2. **Adjusted θ2 Calculation**: The computation of θ2 has been adjusted to account for the offsets introduced by the second joint's position.
3. **Set θ3 = 0**: Based on the feedback, the third joint does not contribute to the TCP's position in the given scenarios. Therefore, we set θ3 = 0.

This revised implementation should produce the correct joint angles for the given target positions.
