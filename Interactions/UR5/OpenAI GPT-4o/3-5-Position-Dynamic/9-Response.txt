To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is:
\[
\text{TCP} = [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
\]
This is the result of the combined transformations of the three revolute joints.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The manipulator has three revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1** rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2** rotates about the Z-axis.
3. **Revolute 3** rotates about the Y-axis.

The target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) can be reached by solving for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \).

### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint, \( \theta_1 \), determines the rotation about the Y-axis. Using the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane, we can compute \( \theta_1 \) as:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(x, z)
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \)
The second and third joints determine the position in the YZ-plane. By considering the geometry of the manipulator, we can use trigonometry to solve for \( \theta_2 \) and \( \theta_3 \).

### Step 5: Write the Code
Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, z)

    # Effective length in the YZ-plane
    d = math.sqrt(y**2 + z**2)

    # Link lengths
    l1 = 0.093  # Length of link 2
    l2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3

    # Solve for theta3 using the cosine rule
    cos_theta3 = (d**2 - l1**2 - l2**2) / (2 * l1 * l2)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Solve for theta2
    alpha = math.atan2(y, z)
    beta = math.asin((l2 * math.sin(theta3)) / d)
    theta2 = alpha - beta

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).
