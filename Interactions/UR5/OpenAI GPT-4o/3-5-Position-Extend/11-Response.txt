The feedback indicates that the revised solution still fails to reach the target positions. The primary issues seem to be with the calculations for \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\), as the third joint (\(\theta_3\)) is correctly set to 0. The errors suggest that the geometry and trigonometric relationships used in the calculations are incorrect or incomplete.

### Observations from Feedback
1. **\(\theta_1\) Errors**: The calculated \(\theta_1\) values are consistently off, indicating an issue with the projection onto the XZ-plane.
2. **\(\theta_2\) Errors**: The calculated \(\theta_2\) values are also consistently off, suggesting an error in the effective distance or angle calculations.
3. **Correct \(\theta_3 = 0\)**: The third joint is correctly set to 0, as it does not contribute to the TCP's position.

### Revised Approach
To address these issues, we need to carefully reanalyze the geometry of the manipulator and ensure that the trigonometric relationships are correctly applied.

#### Step 1: Geometry of the Manipulator
- **Link 1**: Rotates about the Y-axis (\(\theta_1\)).
- **Link 2**: Rotates about the Z-axis (\(\theta_2\)).
- **Link 3**: Fixed in orientation and contributes a constant offset to the TCP's position.

The TCP's position is influenced by the rotations of the first two links and the fixed offset of the third link.

#### Step 2: Solve for \(\theta_1\)
\(\theta_1\) is determined by the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(p_x, p_z)
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(\theta_2\)
The effective position in the YZ-plane is adjusted for the offset of the third link. Using the law of cosines, we can solve for \(\theta_2\).

#### Step 4: Implement the Solution
We will now revise the `inverse_kinematics` function to correctly calculate \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\), and set \(\theta_3 = 0\).

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    px, py, pz = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2
    # Adjust for the offset of link 3
    py_eff = py - 0.093  # Offset of link 2
    pz_eff = pz - 0.09465  # Offset of link 3

    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.093  # Length of link 2

    # Effective distance to the target
    d_eff = math.sqrt(py_eff**2 + pz_eff**2)

    # Law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = py_eff / d_eff
    theta2 = math.asin(cos_theta2)

    # Step 3: Set theta3 to 0
    theta3 = 0

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **\(\theta_3 = 0\)**: The third joint is fixed and does not contribute to the TCP's position.
2. **Adjusted Geometry**: The effective position in the YZ-plane is adjusted for the offsets of links 2 and 3.
3. **Simplified Calculations**: The law of cosines is used to calculate \(\theta_2\) based on the effective distance to the target.

This revised solution should correctly calculate the joint angles for all test cases.
