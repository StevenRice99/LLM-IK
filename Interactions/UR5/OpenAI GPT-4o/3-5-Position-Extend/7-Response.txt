To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \(p = (x, y, z)\). Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions of each link and the TCP. The TCP position is influenced by the rotations of the three revolute joints. The axes of rotation are:
- Joint 1: Y-axis
- Joint 2: Z-axis
- Joint 3: Y-axis

The TCP position is given as:
\[
\text{TCP} = [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
\]

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The inverse kinematics can be solved in stages:
1. Solve for \(\theta_1\) using the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane.
2. Solve for \(\theta_2\) using the projection of the target position onto the YZ-plane.
3. Solve for \(\theta_3\) by considering the remaining degrees of freedom to align the TCP.

### Step 3: Use the Existing Solution
The provided solution already calculates \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) for a sub-chain. We can extend this to include \(\theta_3\).

### Step 4: Write the Complete Solution
We will now complete the `inverse_kinematics` function to calculate all three joint angles.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    px, py, pz = p

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2
    # Project the target position onto the YZ-plane
    d = math.sqrt(px**2 + pz**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    py_eff = py - 0.093  # Adjust for the offset of link 2
    d_eff = math.sqrt(d**2 + py_eff**2)  # Effective distance to the target

    # Link lengths
    l2 = 0.093  # Length of link 2
    l3 = 0.09465  # Length of link 3

    # Law of cosines to find theta2
    cos_theta2 = (l2**2 + d_eff**2 - l3**2) / (2 * l2 * d_eff)
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2) - math.atan2(py_eff, d)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3
    # Law of cosines to find theta3
    cos_theta3 = (l2**2 + l3**2 - d_eff**2) / (2 * l2 * l3)
    theta3 = math.acos(cos_theta3)

    # Return the joint angles
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Theta1**: Calculated using the arctangent of the X and Z coordinates of the target position.
2. **Theta2**: Adjusted for the offset of link 2 and calculated using the law of cosines and the effective distance to the target.
3. **Theta3**: Calculated using the law of cosines based on the triangle formed by the links and the target position.

This solution assumes all targets are reachable and does not include checks for joint limits or singularities.
