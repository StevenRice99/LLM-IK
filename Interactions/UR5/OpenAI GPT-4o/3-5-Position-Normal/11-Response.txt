The feedback indicates that the revised inverse kinematics function still fails to compute the correct joint angles for the given target positions. The primary issues seem to be:

1. **Incorrect computation of \(\theta_1\)**:
   - The computed \(\theta_1\) values are significantly different from the correct values. This suggests that the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane is not being handled correctly.

2. **Incorrect computation of \(\theta_2\)**:
   - The computed \(\theta_2\) values are also significantly different from the correct values. This indicates that the geometric relationships between the links and the target position are not being properly accounted for.

3. **\(\theta_3 = 0\)**:
   - While \(\theta_3\) is correctly set to \(0\), the errors in \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) prevent the TCP from reaching the target position.

### Revised Approach
To address these issues, I will:
1. Revisit the geometric relationships and ensure that the projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane is correctly computed.
2. Use the law of cosines to compute \(\theta_2\) more accurately, taking into account the lengths of the links and the target position.
3. Validate the revised solution using the provided forward kinematics function.

Let me now revise the inverse kinematics function again.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.093  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.0823  # Offset of the TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Project the target position onto the XZ-plane
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, -z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    d = y - L3  # Effective height to reach
    D = (r**2 + d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)  # Cosine of the angle between L1 and L2

    # Ensure D is within the valid range for acos
    D = np.clip(D, -1.0, 1.0)

    # Compute theta2 using the law of cosines
    theta2 = np.arctan2(d, r) - np.arccos(D)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, theta3 is consistently 0
    theta3 = 0

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - The projection of the target position onto the XZ-plane is computed as \(r = \sqrt{x^2 + z^2}\).
   - The angle \(\theta_1\) is computed using \(\arctan2(x, -z)\), ensuring the correct quadrant is used.

2. **Theta2 Calculation**:
   - The effective height \(d = y - L3\) is computed to account for the TCP offset.
   - The cosine of the angle between the two links is computed using the law of cosines: \(D = \frac{r^2 + d^2 - L1^2 - L2^2}{2 L1 L2}\).
   - The value of \(D\) is clamped to the range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid numerical errors.
   - The angle \(\theta_2\) is computed as \(\arctan2(d, r) - \arccos(D)\).

3. **Theta3**:
   - Based on the feedback, \(\theta_3\) is consistently \(0\), so it is directly set to \(0\).

This revised function should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target positions.
