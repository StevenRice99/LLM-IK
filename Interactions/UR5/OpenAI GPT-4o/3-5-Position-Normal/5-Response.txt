To solve the inverse kinematics for this 3-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, we know the positions of each link and the TCP. The TCP position is influenced by the rotations of the three revolute joints:
1. Revolute 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
2. Revolute 2 rotates about the Z-axis.
3. Revolute 3 rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is given as:
\[
\text{TCP Position} = [x_\text{TCP}, y_\text{TCP}, z_\text{TCP}] = [0, 0.1753, 0.09465]
\]

### Step 2: Target Position
The target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) is the desired position for the TCP. We need to solve for the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) such that the forward kinematics matches this target position.

### Step 3: Geometric Relationships
Using the link positions and orientations, we can derive the following:
1. Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \)) affects the rotation about the Y-axis.
2. Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \)) affects the rotation about the Z-axis.
3. Revolute 3 (\( \theta_3 \)) affects the rotation about the Y-axis again.

The TCP position can be expressed as a function of these joint angles and the link lengths.

### Step 4: Solve for Joint Angles
We will use trigonometric relationships and the given link dimensions to solve for \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \). Let me now proceed to implement the solution in the provided Python function.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.093  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.0823  # Offset of the TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Projection of the target on the XZ-plane
    d = y - L3  # Effective height to reach
    theta2 = np.arctan2(d, r) - np.arcsin(L2 / np.sqrt(r**2 + d**2))

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta3 = np.pi / 2 - theta2  # Based on the orientation of the TCP

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) required to position the TCP at the desired target position \( p \).
