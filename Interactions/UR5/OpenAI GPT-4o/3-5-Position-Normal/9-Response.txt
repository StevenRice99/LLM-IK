The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values \([-1.679530425466793, 1.554806008890719, 0]\) produce the desired TCP position \([-0.085160971497221, 0.09431594708269701, -0.092074913613455]\). This indicates that the issue lies in the analytical solution provided earlier, which failed to compute the correct joint angles.

### Observations from the Feedback
1. The third joint (\(\theta_3\)) is consistently \(0\) in the correct solutions. This suggests that the TCP orientation is primarily determined by the first two joints (\(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\)).
2. The analytical solution provided earlier incorrectly computed \(\theta_3\) as non-zero, which likely caused the TCP to deviate from the target position.
3. The incorrect computation of \(\theta_2\) also contributed to the errors in reaching the target positions.

### Revised Approach
To fix the issues, I will:
1. Revisit the geometric relationships and ensure that \(\theta_3 = 0\) is enforced.
2. Correct the computation of \(\theta_2\) by considering the projection of the target position onto the plane defined by the first two joints.
3. Use the forward kinematics results to validate the revised inverse kinematics solution.

Let me now revise the inverse kinematics function.
```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.093  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.0823  # Offset of the TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, -z)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # Project the target position onto the plane of the first two links
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2)  # Distance in the XZ-plane
    d = y - L3  # Effective height to reach
    D = (r**2 + d**2 - L1**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L1 * L2)  # Cosine of the angle between L1 and L2

    # Ensure D is within the valid range for acos
    D = np.clip(D, -1.0, 1.0)

    theta2 = np.arctan2(d, r) - np.arccos(D)

    # Step 3: Solve for theta3 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Based on the feedback, theta3 is consistently 0
    theta3 = 0

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - The rotation about the Y-axis (\(\theta_1\)) is computed using the arctangent of the target's \(x\) and \(z\) coordinates. The sign of \(z\) is adjusted to ensure the correct quadrant.

2. **Theta2 Calculation**:
   - The projection of the target position onto the plane of the first two links is used to compute the effective distance (\(r\)) and height (\(d\)).
   - The law of cosines is applied to compute the angle between the two links, ensuring that the cosine value (\(D\)) is clamped to the valid range \([-1, 1]\) to avoid numerical errors.

3. **Theta3**:
   - Based on the feedback, \(\theta_3\) is consistently \(0\), so it is directly set to \(0\).

This revised function should now correctly compute the joint angles for the given target positions.
