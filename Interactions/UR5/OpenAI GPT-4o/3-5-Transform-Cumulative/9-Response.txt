It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. Let us now proceed to solve the inverse kinematics problem step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the problem
The task is to determine the joint angles \((\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3)\) that allow the robot to reach a given target position \(p = (x, y, z)\) and orientation \(r = (roll, pitch, yaw)\). The robot has 3 revolute joints with the following axes:
- Joint 1 rotates about the Y-axis.
- Joint 2 rotates about the Z-axis.
- Joint 3 rotates about the Y-axis.

### Step 2: Use existing solutions
The existing solutions provide partial inverse kinematics for sub-chains:
1. **Existing Code 1**: Solves for \(\theta_1\) based on the target position.
2. **Existing Code 2**: Solves for \(\theta_2\) based on the target position.
3. **Existing Code 3**: Solves for \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\) based on the target position and orientation.
4. **Existing Code 4**: Solves for \(\theta_3\) based on the target position.

### Step 3: Combine the solutions
To solve the full inverse kinematics:
1. Use the target position \(p = (x, y, z)\) to calculate \(\theta_1\) using the relationship between the base and the target.
2. Use the target position and orientation to calculate \(\theta_2\) and \(\theta_3\).

Let me proceed to implement the solution.
