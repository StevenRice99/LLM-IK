To solve the inverse kinematics for the entire chain, I will combine the solutions for the sub-chains provided in the "EXISTING" sections. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Joint 1 (Revolute 1)**:  
   Use the solution from "EXISTING 1" to calculate the angle for joint 1 based on the target position `p`.

2. **Joints 2 and 3 (Revolute 2 and Revolute 3)**:  
   Use the solution from "EXISTING 2" to calculate the angles for joints 2 and 3 based on the target position `p` and orientation `r`.

3. **Combine the Results**:  
   Return the angles for joints 1, 2, and 3 as a tuple.

Now, I will implement the solution.
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Step 1: Solve for joint 1 using EXISTING 1
    px, py, pz = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for joints 2 and 3 using EXISTING 2
    # Adjust the target position to account for the first joint's rotation
    adjusted_p = (px, py - 0.093, pz)  # Subtract the offset of Revolute 2
    theta2, theta3 = inverse_kinematics(adjusted_p, r)
    
    # Combine the results
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```
