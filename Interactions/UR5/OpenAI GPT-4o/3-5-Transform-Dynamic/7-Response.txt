The error indicates that the function `inverse_kinematics_2_3` is not defined. This happened because I assumed the "EXISTING 2" function was named `inverse_kinematics_2_3`, but the actual name of the function was not explicitly provided in the feedback or instructions.

To resolve this, I will directly integrate the logic from "EXISTING 2" into the solution instead of assuming a separate function name. Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Step 1: Solve for joint 1 using EXISTING 1
    px, py, pz = p
    theta1 = math.atan2(px, pz)
    
    # Step 2: Solve for joints 2 and 3 using the logic from EXISTING 2
    # Adjust the target position to account for the first joint's rotation
    x, y, z = px, py - 0.093, pz  # Subtract the offset of Revolute 2
    target_roll, target_pitch, target_yaw = r
    
    # Calculate theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # Calculate the rotation matrix for the target orientation
    R_target = np.array([
        [math.cos(target_yaw) * math.cos(target_pitch), 
         math.cos(target_yaw) * math.sin(target_pitch) * math.sin(target_roll) - math.sin(target_yaw) * math.cos(target_roll), 
         math.cos(target_yaw) * math.sin(target_pitch) * math.cos(target_roll) + math.sin(target_yaw) * math.sin(target_roll)],
        [math.sin(target_yaw) * math.cos(target_pitch), 
         math.sin(target_yaw) * math.sin(target_pitch) * math.sin(target_roll) + math.cos(target_yaw) * math.cos(target_roll), 
         math.sin(target_yaw) * math.sin(target_pitch) * math.cos(target_roll) - math.cos(target_yaw) * math.sin(target_roll)],
        [-math.sin(target_pitch), 
         math.cos(target_pitch) * math.sin(target_roll), 
         math.cos(target_pitch) * math.cos(target_roll)]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the rotation matrix for theta2
    R_theta2 = np.array([
        [math.cos(theta2), -math.sin(theta2), 0],
        [math.sin(theta2), math.cos(theta2), 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ])
    
    # Calculate the rotation matrix for theta3
    R_theta3 = np.linalg.inv(R_theta2) @ R_target
    theta3 = math.atan2(R_theta3[2, 1], R_theta3[2, 2])
    
    # Combine the results
    return (theta1, theta2, theta3)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Integrated "EXISTING 2" Logic**: Instead of calling a non-existent function, I directly included the logic from "EXISTING 2" to calculate `theta2` and `theta3`.
2. **Adjusted Position for Joint 2**: Subtracted the offset of Revolute 2 (`0.093`) from the `y` coordinate of the target position.
3. **Rotation Matrix Calculations**: Used the provided formulas from "EXISTING 2" to compute the rotation matrices and solve for `theta3`.

This implementation should now work correctly. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!
