To solve the inverse kinematics problem, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) that allow the manipulator to reach the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics results, we observe:
- The TCP position is influenced by the joint angles and link lengths.
- The orientation of the TCP is determined by the rotation matrices of the joints.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The manipulator has 3 revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1** rotates about the Y-axis.
2. **Revolute 2** rotates about the Z-axis.
3. **Revolute 3** rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is given by:
\[
p_{TCP} = [x_{TCP}, y_{TCP}, z_{TCP}]
\]
The orientation is given by:
\[
r_{TCP} = [r_x, r_y, r_z]
\]

### Step 3: Solve for Joint Angles
1. **Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \))**:
   - This joint rotates about the Y-axis and primarily affects the X and Z coordinates of the TCP.
   - Using trigonometry, we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) based on the projection of the TCP position onto the XZ-plane.

2. **Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \))**:
   - This joint rotates about the Z-axis and affects the Y-coordinate of the TCP.
   - We can solve for \( \theta_2 \) by isolating the Y-component of the TCP position.

3. **Revolute 3 (\( \theta_3 \))**:
   - This joint rotates about the Y-axis and adjusts the final position and orientation of the TCP.
   - We can solve for \( \theta_3 \) by considering the remaining position and orientation constraints.

### Step 4: Write the Solution
Using the above steps, we can derive the joint angles analytically. Let me now complete the Python function to compute the inverse kinematics.

```python
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.093  # Length of link 1
    L2 = 0.09465  # Length of link 2
    L3 = 0.0823  # Offset of the TCP

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Y-axis)
    theta1 = np.arctan2(x, z)

    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Z-axis)
    y_prime = y - L3  # Adjust for TCP offset
    theta2 = np.arctan2(y_prime, np.sqrt(x**2 + z**2))

    # Solve for theta3 (rotation about Y-axis)
    z_prime = z - L1  # Adjust for link lengths
    theta3 = np.arctan2(z_prime, L2)

    return theta1, theta2, theta3
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to reach the desired position and orientation.
