From the forward kinematics results for the correct joint values \([-1.679530425900148, 1.5548059695416891, -0.46265433153602]\), we can observe the following:

1. The TCP position is \([-0.08516097146293881, 0.09431595032070864, -0.09207491359888396]\), which matches the target position.
2. The TCP orientation is \([2.82437712923186, 1.4608973404084629, 0.1463090318517335]\), which matches the target orientation.

### Observations
The forward kinematics results confirm that the joint values provided are correct. This means the inverse kinematics solution must compute these joint values to reach the target position and orientation.

### Adjustments to the Inverse Kinematics Function
The current inverse kinematics function failed to compute the correct joint values. The issues likely stem from:
1. Incorrect handling of the link offsets and rotations.
2. Incorrect decomposition of the target position and orientation into joint contributions.

### Plan for Fixing the Inverse Kinematics
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Chain**:
   - Incorporate the link offsets and rotations correctly.
   - Ensure the transformations are applied in the correct order.

2. **Use the Target Orientation**:
   - The current function does not fully utilize the target orientation to compute the joint angles.
   - Incorporate the orientation constraints into the solution.

3. **Recompute the Joint Angles**:
   - Use the correct transformations to compute \(\theta_1\), \(\theta_2\), and \(\theta_3\).

Let me now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.

This revised function incorporates symbolic transformations and ensures the correct handling of link offsets and rotations. It also uses the target orientation to compute the joint angles.
