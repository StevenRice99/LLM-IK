The forward kinematics results confirm that the correct joint values produce the desired position and orientation. The issue with the inverse kinematics function lies in the computation of the orientation, particularly the yaw angle (\( \theta_3 \)).

### Observations:
1. The position calculations for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) are accurate, as the positions reached are very close to the targets.
2. The orientation calculations for \( \theta_3 \) are incorrect, leading to significant deviations in the yaw angle.

### Plan to Fix:
1. Analyze the relationship between the joint angles and the orientation of the TCP.
2. Correct the computation of \( \theta_3 \) to ensure the desired orientation is achieved.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - The position calculation for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) remains unchanged, as it was already accurate.

2. **Orientation Calculation**:
   - The desired orientation is represented as a rotation matrix \( R_{\text{desired}} \), computed from the given roll, pitch, and yaw angles.
   - The rotation matrix \( R_{12} \) is computed from \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), representing the orientation of the manipulator up to the second joint.
   - The rotation matrix \( R_3 \) is computed as \( R_3 = R_{12}^{-1} R_{\text{desired}} \), representing the orientation adjustment needed by the third joint.
   - The angle \( \theta_3 \) is extracted from \( R_3 \) using the \( \text{atan2} \) function.

This approach ensures that the computed joint angles achieve both the desired position and orientation.
