It seems the forward kinematics results are consistent. Now, I will proceed to complete the inverse kinematics function by incorporating both position and orientation into the solution.

### Analysis:
1. **Position**: The existing solution already calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \), \( \theta_2 \), and \( \theta_3 \) to reach the target position \( p \).
2. **Orientation**: The TCP orientation is given as [0, 0, 1.570796325] (roll, pitch, yaw). This corresponds to a rotation about the Z-axis by \( \pi/2 \). The orientation of the TCP can be achieved by adjusting \( \theta_3 \), as it directly affects the end-effector's orientation.

### Plan:
- Use the existing position solution to calculate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
- Adjust \( \theta_3 \) to account for the desired orientation.

Here is the completed function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Solve for position (θ1 and θ2)
    A = 0.09465
    B = 0.0823
    cosθ2 = (y - 0.093) / 0.0823
    θ2 = math.acos(cosθ2)
    sinθ2 = math.sin(θ2)
    M = [[A, -B * sinθ2], [B * sinθ2, A]]
    det_M = M[0][0] * M[1][1] - M[0][1] * M[1][0]
    if det_M == 0:
        raise ValueError('Matrix is singular; target position is not reachable.')
    inv_det_M = 1.0 / det_M
    inv_M = [[inv_det_M * M[1][1], -inv_det_M * M[0][1]], [-inv_det_M * M[1][0], inv_det_M * M[0][0]]]
    sinθ1 = inv_M[0][0] * x + inv_M[0][1] * z
    cosθ1 = inv_M[1][0] * x + inv_M[1][1] * z
    sinθ1 = max(min(sinθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    cosθ1 = max(min(cosθ1, 1.0), -1.0)
    θ1 = math.atan2(sinθ1, cosθ1)

    # Solve for orientation (θ3)
    # The desired yaw is π/2, and θ3 directly contributes to the yaw.
    # Since the initial orientation of the TCP is already aligned with yaw = π/2,
    # θ3 does not need additional adjustment for this specific case.
    θ3 = yaw - 1.570796325  # Adjust θ3 to match the desired yaw

    return (θ1, θ2, θ3)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Position**: The existing solution is used to calculate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position \( p \).
2. **Orientation**: The yaw angle of the TCP is adjusted by modifying \( \theta_3 \). Since the default yaw is already \( \pi/2 \), \( \theta_3 \) is adjusted to account for any deviation from this value.

This function should now correctly compute the joint angles to achieve both the desired position and orientation.
