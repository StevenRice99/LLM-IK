The error indicates that the term inside the `math.sqrt` function is negative, which is invalid for real numbers. This suggests that the calculation for \(\theta_2\) is incorrect, specifically in the term:

\[
\sqrt{r^2 + d^2 - L_2^2}
\]

This term must always be non-negative, but in the current implementation, it can become negative due to an incorrect formulation of the inverse kinematics equations. Let's revisit the derivation and fix the issue.

---

### Revisiting the Inverse Kinematics Derivation

1. **Geometry of the Manipulator**:
   - The TCP position is determined by the two links:
     - \(L_1 = 0.09465\) (distance along the Z-axis from the base to joint 2),
     - \(L_2 = 0.0823\) (distance from joint 2 to the TCP along the Y-axis in the local frame).

   - The target position is given as \(p = (x, y, z)\).

2. **Radial Distance**:
   - The radial distance in the XY-plane is:
     \[
     r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
     \]

3. **Vertical Distance**:
   - The vertical distance from the base to the target is:
     \[
     d = z - L_1
     \]

4. **Constraint for Reachability**:
   - The manipulator can only reach the target if the distance from joint 2 to the TCP is less than or equal to \(L_2\). This is given by:
     \[
     r^2 + d^2 \leq L_2^2
     \]
   - If this condition is violated, the square root term becomes negative, leading to the "math domain error."

5. **Correcting the Equation for \(\theta_2\)**:
   - To compute \(\theta_2\), we use the law of cosines:
     \[
     \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{r^2 + d^2 - L_2^2}{2 \cdot L_2 \cdot \sqrt{r^2 + d^2}}
     \]
   - The angle \(\theta_2\) is then:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{r^2 + d^2 - L_2^2}{2 \cdot L_2 \cdot \sqrt{r^2 + d^2}}\right)
     \]

### Updated Implementation

Here is the corrected implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z-axis from base to joint 2
    L2 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 2 to TCP along Y-axis in local frame
    
    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ2
    # Radial and vertical distances
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    d = z - L1                 # Vertical distance along Z-axis from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Check for reachability (this is guaranteed by the problem statement)
    distance_squared = r**2 + d**2
    if distance_squared > L2**2:
        raise ValueError("Target position is out of reach.")
    
    # Compute θ2 using the law of cosines
    theta2 = math.atan2(d, r) - math.acos((r**2 + d**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L2 * math.sqrt(r**2 + d**2)))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Law of Cosines**:
   - The term \(\sqrt{r^2 + d^2 - L_2^2}\) was replaced with the correct formulation using the law of cosines.

2. **Reachability Check**:
   - Although the problem guarantees that all targets are reachable, I added a check to ensure that \(r^2 + d^2 \leq L_2^2\). This prevents invalid inputs from causing a "math domain error."

3. **Angle Calculation**:
   - The angle \(\theta_2\) is now computed using the correct geometric relationships.

This updated implementation should resolve the "math domain error" and work correctly for all valid inputs.
