The error indicates that the reachability check is incorrectly flagging valid inputs as "out of reach." This suggests that the condition for reachability is either unnecessary (since the problem guarantees all targets are reachable) or incorrectly implemented.

Let’s revisit the reachability condition and fix the issue.

### Revisiting the Reachability Condition

1. **Problem Statement**:
   - The problem explicitly states that all target positions are reachable. Therefore, we do not need to check for reachability, and the condition:
     \[
     r^2 + d^2 \leq L_2^2
     \]
     can be removed entirely.

2. **Law of Cosines**:
   - The law of cosines is still valid for computing \(\theta_2\), but we should not raise an error for any input since all inputs are guaranteed to be valid.

### Updated Implementation

Here is the corrected implementation without the unnecessary reachability check:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z-axis from base to joint 2
    L2 = 0.0823   # Distance from joint 2 to TCP along Y-axis in local frame
    
    # Solve for θ1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for θ2
    # Radial and vertical distances
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    d = z - L1                 # Vertical distance along Z-axis from joint 2 to TCP
    
    # Compute θ2 using the law of cosines
    theta2 = math.atan2(d, r) - math.acos((r**2 + d**2 - L2**2) / (2 * L2 * math.sqrt(r**2 + d**2)))
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Removed Reachability Check**:
   - The condition `if distance_squared > L2**2` was removed because the problem guarantees that all target positions are reachable.

2. **Simplified Logic**:
   - The function now directly computes \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) without any unnecessary checks.

This updated implementation should resolve the "Target position is out of reach" error and work correctly for all valid inputs.
