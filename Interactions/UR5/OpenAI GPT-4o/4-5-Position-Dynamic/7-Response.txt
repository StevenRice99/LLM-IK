The feedback indicates that the solution is still failing to compute the correct joint angles, particularly for \( \theta_1 \). The reached positions are incorrect, and the computed joint angles are consistently off by a factor of approximately 2. This suggests that the computation of \( \theta_1 \) is not properly accounting for the TCP's orientation and offset.

### Key Observations
1. **Incorrect \( \theta_1 \)**: The computed \( \theta_1 \) values are consistently off by a factor of approximately 2. This suggests that the TCP's offset and orientation are not being properly accounted for in the computation of \( \theta_1 \).
2. **Constant \( \theta_2 \)**: The values for \( \theta_2 \) are consistently close to zero, which suggests that the computation for \( \theta_2 \) is not being properly influenced by the target position.

### Correcting the Approach
To address these issues, we need to:
1. Properly account for the TCP's offset and orientation when computing \( \theta_1 \).
2. Ensure that \( \theta_2 \) is computed based on the correct projection of the target position in the \( x \)-\( y \)-\( z \) space.

### Updated Solution
Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # TCP offset in the local frame
    tcp_offset = 0.0823  # Offset along the Y-axis in the local frame
    
    # Adjust the target position to account for the TCP offset
    adjusted_x = x
    adjusted_y = y - tcp_offset  # Subtract the TCP offset along the Y-axis
    adjusted_z = z - 0.09465  # Subtract the fixed height of the second joint
    
    # Solve for theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)  # Use the unadjusted x and y for theta1
    
    # Solve for theta2
    r = math.sqrt(adjusted_x**2 + adjusted_y**2)
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_z, r)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **TCP Offset Adjustment**: The target position is adjusted to account for the TCP's offset along the Y-axis in the local frame. This ensures that the computation of \( \theta_1 \) aligns the TCP with the target.
2. **Height Adjustment**: The target \( z \)-coordinate is adjusted to account for the fixed height of the second joint. This ensures that \( \theta_2 \) is computed relative to the correct reference point.
3. **Projection for \( \theta_2 \)**: The computation of \( \theta_2 \) is based on the projection of the adjusted target position in the \( x \)-\( y \)-\( z \) space. This ensures that \( \theta_2 \) is influenced by both the horizontal and vertical components of the target position.

### Next Steps
This updated solution should correctly compute the joint angles for all valid target positions. If further issues arise, additional debugging and testing will be required to refine the approach.
