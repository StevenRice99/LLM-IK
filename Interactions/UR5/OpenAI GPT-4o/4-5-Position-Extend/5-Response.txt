To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Understand the Kinematic Chain**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Y-axis.

2. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - The TCP position is determined by the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), as well as the fixed link lengths and offsets.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Use the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
   - \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the projection of the target position onto the X-Y plane.
   - \( \theta_2 \) is determined by the relative position of the TCP along the manipulator's kinematic chain.

### Derivation:
- The TCP position in the global frame is given by:
  \[
  \text{TCP}_x = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
  \]
  \[
  \text{TCP}_y = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
  \]
  \[
  \text{TCP}_z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
  \]
  where:
  - \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) (distance along Z-axis to Revolute 2),
  - \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) (distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Y-axis).

- From the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \):
  - Compute \( \theta_1 \) using the projection onto the X-Y plane:
    \[
    \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
    \]
  - Compute \( \theta_2 \) using the Z-coordinate and the distance to the TCP:
    \[
    r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
    \]
    \[
    \theta_2 = \arctan2(r, z - L_1)
    \]

### Implementation:
Here is the Python implementation of the inverse kinematics function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z-axis to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.0823   # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Y-axis
    
    # Compute theta1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Compute r (distance in the X-Y plane)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    
    # Compute theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(r, z - L1)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \).
