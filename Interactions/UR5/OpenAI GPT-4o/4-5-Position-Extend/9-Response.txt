The feedback indicates that the computed joint values for \( \theta_1 \) are incorrect, leading to the TCP being positioned in the wrong location. The issue lies in the calculation of \( \theta_1 \), which is not correctly aligning the TCP with the target position in the X-Y plane.

### Observations:
1. The Z-coordinate of the TCP is correct, which confirms that \( \theta_2 = 0 \) is valid.
2. The X-Y plane projection is not being handled correctly, as the computed \( \theta_1 \) values are consistently off by a significant margin.

### Root Cause:
The incorrect \( \theta_1 \) values suggest that the calculation of the angle using `atan2(y, x)` is not properly accounting for the manipulator's configuration or the target position's orientation.

### Correct Approach:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that:
1. \( \theta_1 \) is computed as the angle between the target position and the X-axis in the X-Y plane.
2. The calculation of \( \theta_1 \) must correctly handle all quadrants of the X-Y plane.

### Updated Implementation:
Here is the corrected Python implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Compute theta1 based on the X-Y projection
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Set theta2 to 0, as the Z-coordinate is constant
    theta2 = 0
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - The angle \( \theta_1 \) is computed using the arctangent of the Y and X coordinates of the target position. This determines the rotation of Revolute 1 to align the TCP with the target in the X-Y plane.
   - The `atan2` function is used to ensure that the angle is computed correctly for all quadrants of the X-Y plane.

2. **Theta2 Assignment**:
   - Since the TCP's Z-coordinate matches the height of Revolute 2, no additional rotation is needed from Revolute 2. Therefore, \( \theta_2 = 0 \).

This implementation should now correctly compute the joint angles for all valid targets. If the issue persists, further debugging will be required to identify any additional errors in the kinematic model or the implementation.
