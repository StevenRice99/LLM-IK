The feedback indicates that the computed positions are rotated by 90 degrees in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane compared to the target positions. This suggests that the computation of \( \theta_1 \) is incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the coordinate system or the order of arguments in the `atan2` function.

### Observations:
1. The TCP's position is consistently rotated by 90 degrees in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane, which means the sine and cosine components of \( \theta_1 \) are swapped.
2. This issue arises because the arguments to `atan2` were incorrectly ordered. The correct order for `atan2` is `atan2(y, x)` to compute the angle in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

### Updated Plan:
1. **Fix the Computation of \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - Use the correct order of arguments for `atan2` to compute \( \theta_1 \) based on the target \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates.
   - Specifically, \( \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x) \).

2. **Verify the Computation of \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - The feedback shows that \( \theta_2 \) is consistently close to zero, which is expected since the TCP's \( z \)-coordinate is fixed at \( 0.09465 \). This part of the computation appears correct.

3. **Implement the Fix**:
   - Correct the order of arguments in the `atan2` function for \( \theta_1 \).

Let me now update the code to address this issue.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Fixed link lengths
    d1 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z-axis for Revolute 2
    l2 = 0.0823   # Length of the link to the TCP along Y-axis

    # Solve for theta1 using x and y
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)  # Corrected order of arguments

    # Solve for theta2 using z
    # Ensure the argument of arcsin is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    sin_theta2 = (z - d1) / l2
    sin_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, sin_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. The computation of \( \theta_1 \) now uses the correct order of arguments for `atan2`, i.e., `atan2(y, x)`. This ensures that the angle is computed correctly in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.
2. The computation of \( \theta_2 \) remains unchanged, as it was already correct.

This updated function should now produce the correct joint angles for all target positions.
