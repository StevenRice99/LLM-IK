To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Understand the Kinematic Chain**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Y-axis.

2. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - The TCP position is determined by the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), along with the fixed link lengths and offsets.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Use the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) analytically.

4. **Mathematical Derivation**:
   - The TCP position in the global frame can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{TCP}_x = 0
     \]
     \[
     \text{TCP}_y = 0.0823 \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     \text{TCP}_z = 0.09465 + 0.0823 \sin(\theta_2)
     \]
   - From the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \), solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

5. **Implementation**:
   - Solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the \( y \) and \( z \) components of the target position.
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 \) (if needed, though it may not affect the TCP position in this case).

Let me now proceed to implement the solution.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Fixed link lengths
    d1 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z-axis for Revolute 2
    l2 = 0.0823   # Length of the link to the TCP along Y-axis

    # Solve for theta2 using the y and z components
    # TCP_y = l2 * cos(theta2)
    # TCP_z = d1 + l2 * sin(theta2)
    # Rearrange to find theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(z - d1, y)

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # In this case, x is always 0, so theta1 does not affect the TCP position
    theta1 = 0.0

    return theta1, theta2
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). The solution assumes that the manipulator's configuration allows for the target to be reachable, as stated in the instructions.
