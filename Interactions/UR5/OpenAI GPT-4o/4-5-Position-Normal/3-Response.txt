To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired target position \( p = (x, y, z) \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Forward Kinematics Recap**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from the second joint by a fixed distance along the Y-axis.

2. **Target Position**:
   - The target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) is given in the global frame.
   - We need to compute the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to achieve this position.

3. **Geometric Approach**:
   - The TCP's position depends on the rotation of both joints and the fixed link lengths.
   - Using trigonometry, we can derive the equations for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

4. **Plan**:
   - Use the target position \( p \) to compute the required angles.
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the projection of \( p \) onto the XY-plane.
   - Solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the Z-coordinate and the geometry of the manipulator.

I will now proceed to derive the equations and complete the function.
Here is the completed Python function for the inverse kinematics of the 2-DOF manipulator:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Fixed link lengths
    d1 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z-axis to Revolute 2
    d2 = 0.0823   # Offset along Y-axis to TCP

    # Step 1: Solve for θ1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    # θ1 is the angle in the XY-plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Solve for θ2 (rotation about Y-axis)
    # Project the TCP position into the plane of the second joint
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    z_eff = z - d1              # Effective Z-coordinate relative to Revolute 2

    # Use trigonometry to find θ2
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_eff, r - d2)

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input**:
   - The target position \( p = (x, y, z) \) is provided as input.

2. **Step 1: Compute \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - \( \theta_1 \) is the angle in the XY-plane, calculated using the `atan2` function:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
     \]

3. **Step 2: Compute \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - The effective Z-coordinate \( z_{\text{eff}} \) is adjusted by subtracting the fixed offset \( d1 \).
   - The radial distance \( r \) in the XY-plane is adjusted by subtracting the offset \( d2 \).
   - Using the geometry of the manipulator, \( \theta_2 \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(z_{\text{eff}}, r - d2)
     \]

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) in radians.

This function assumes that the target position is reachable, as stated in the instructions.
