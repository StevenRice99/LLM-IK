To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Understand the Kinematic Chain**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from Revolute 2 by a fixed distance along the Y-axis.

2. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - The TCP position is determined by the joint angles and the link lengths.
   - From the forward kinematics result, the TCP position is:
     \[
     \text{TCP Position} = [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
     \]
     when both joint angles are zero.

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - To solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), we need to express the target position \( p \) in terms of these joint angles and solve the resulting equations.

4. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The TCP position in the global frame can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     y = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1) + L_3
     \]
     \[
     z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     where:
     - \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) (distance along Z-axis to Revolute 2),
     - \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) (distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Y-axis),
     - \( L_3 = 0 \) (no additional offset along Y-axis).

5. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - From the equations above, we can isolate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using trigonometric relationships.

I will now proceed to implement the inverse kinematics solution in Python.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z-axis to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.0823   # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Y-axis

    # Solve for theta2 using the Z-coordinate
    # z = L1 + L2 * cos(theta2)
    # cos(theta2) = (z - L1) / L2
    cos_theta2 = (z - L1) / L2
    theta2 = math.acos(cos_theta2)

    # Solve for theta1 using the X and Y coordinates
    # x = L2 * sin(theta2) * cos(theta1)
    # y = L2 * sin(theta2) * sin(theta1)
    # tan(theta1) = y / x
    sin_theta2 = math.sqrt(1 - cos_theta2**2)  # sin(theta2) from Pythagorean identity
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    return theta1, theta2
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the target position \( p \). It uses trigonometric relationships derived from the forward kinematics equations.
