The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the issue lies in the computation of the joint angles, particularly \( \theta_1 \). The TCP's position depends on the rotation of Revolute 1 about the Z-axis, which was not properly accounted for in the initial solution.

### Observations:
1. The TCP's position in the global frame is influenced by both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
2. The feedback shows that the correct \( \theta_1 \) values are non-zero and vary depending on the target position, which means the rotation about the Z-axis (Revolute 1) is critical to reaching the target.

### Updated Plan:
1. **Revisit the Forward Kinematics**:
   - The TCP's position in the global frame is determined by the rotation of Revolute 1 (\( \theta_1 \)) and the offset introduced by Revolute 2 (\( \theta_2 \)).
   - The TCP's position can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{TCP}_x = l_2 \cos(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{TCP}_y = l_2 \cos(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{TCP}_z = d_1 + l_2 \sin(\theta_2)
     \]
   - Here, \( l_2 = 0.0823 \) and \( d_1 = 0.09465 \).

2. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Use the target \( x, y, z \) coordinates to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).
   - From the equations for \( \text{TCP}_x \) and \( \text{TCP}_y \), compute \( \theta_1 \) as:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \arctan2(\text{TCP}_x, \text{TCP}_y)
     \]
   - From the equation for \( \text{TCP}_z \), compute \( \theta_2 \) as:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \arcsin\left(\frac{\text{TCP}_z - d_1}{l_2}\right)
     \]

3. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Update the inverse kinematics function to compute both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the above equations.

Let me now update the code to reflect this corrected approach.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Fixed link lengths
    d1 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z-axis for Revolute 2
    l2 = 0.0823   # Length of the link to the TCP along Y-axis

    # Solve for theta1 using x and y
    theta1 = math.atan2(x, y)

    # Solve for theta2 using z
    # Ensure the argument of arcsin is within the valid range [-1, 1]
    sin_theta2 = (z - d1) / l2
    sin_theta2 = max(-1.0, min(1.0, sin_theta2))  # Clamp to [-1, 1]
    theta2 = math.asin(sin_theta2)

    return theta1, theta2
```

This updated function computes both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on the target position \( p = (x, y, z) \). It ensures that the arguments for trigonometric functions are within valid ranges to avoid errors.
