The feedback indicates that the TCP positions are still incorrect, and the joint values for \( \theta_1 \) are consistently off by 180 degrees (or \( \pi \) radians). This suggests that the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) is flipped, leading to a mirrored result in the XY-plane.

### Observations:
1. The Z-coordinate is constant at \( z = 0.09465 \), which matches the fixed offset \( L_1 \). This confirms that \( \theta_2 = 0 \) for all targets, as the TCP does not move along the Z-axis.
2. The TCP's position in the XY-plane is mirrored compared to the target positions. This indicates that the calculation of \( \theta_1 \) is flipped by 180 degrees.

### Root Cause:
The issue lies in the calculation of \( \theta_1 \). The current implementation uses:
\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(-y, x)
\]
However, this introduces an unnecessary flip in the XY-plane, resulting in a mirrored TCP position. The correct calculation should use:
\[
\theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
\]
without the negative sign.

### Correct Approach:
1. Since \( \theta_2 = 0 \), the TCP's position in the XY-plane is determined solely by \( \theta_1 \) and the fixed link length \( L_2 \).
2. The TCP's position in the XY-plane can be expressed as:
   \[
   x = L_2 \cos(\theta_1), \quad y = L_2 \sin(\theta_1)
   \]
3. To solve for \( \theta_1 \), we use:
   \[
   \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
   \]

### Updated Code:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z-axis to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.0823   # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Y-axis

    # Solve for theta2
    # Since z = L1 and does not change, theta2 = 0
    theta2 = 0

    # Solve for theta1
    # The TCP's position in the XY-plane is determined by theta1 and L2
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. The Z-coordinate is constant, so \( \theta_2 = 0 \).
2. The calculation of \( \theta_1 \) is corrected to remove the unnecessary negative sign, ensuring that the TCP's position in the XY-plane matches the target position.

This updated code should now correctly calculate the joint angles for all valid target positions.
