To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \).

### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Forward Kinematics**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset by a fixed position relative to the second joint.

2. **Position of the TCP**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by both joint rotations and the fixed link lengths.
   - Using trigonometry, we can express the position of the TCP in terms of \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

3. **Orientation of the TCP**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the cumulative rotations of the joints.

4. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the projection of the TCP position onto the XY-plane.
   - Solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the projection of the TCP position onto the XZ-plane.

### Derivation:
- The TCP position in the global frame is:
  \[
  x = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
  \]
  \[
  y = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
  \]
  \[
  z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
  \]
  where:
  - \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) (link offset along Z-axis),
  - \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) (link offset along Y-axis).

- From the above equations:
  - \( \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x) \) (using the projection onto the XY-plane).
  - \( \theta_2 = \arctan2(z - L_1, \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}) \) (using the projection onto the XZ-plane).

### Implementation:
We can now implement the solution in Python:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position components
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z-axis
    L2 = 0.0823   # Offset along Y-axis
    
    # Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(z - L1, r)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Theta 1**:
   - Calculated using the arctangent of \( y/x \), which gives the angle of the TCP projection in the XY-plane.

2. **Theta 2**:
   - Calculated using the arctangent of \( (z - L1) / r \), where \( r \) is the radial distance in the XY-plane.

This solution ensures that the TCP reaches the desired position \( p \) while respecting the kinematic constraints of the manipulator.
