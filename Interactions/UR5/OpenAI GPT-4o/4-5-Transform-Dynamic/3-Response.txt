The feedback indicates that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is incorrect. The primary issue lies in the incorrect computation of the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), which results in the manipulator failing to reach the desired positions and orientations. The provided correct joint values for each test case suggest that the solution needs to account for the orientation of the TCP in addition to its position.

### Observations from Feedback:
1. **Position Mismatch**:
   - The computed positions are rotated versions of the desired positions. This suggests that the orientation of the TCP is not being properly accounted for in the solution.

2. **Orientation Mismatch**:
   - The computed orientations are significantly different from the desired orientations. This indicates that the orientation component of the inverse kinematics is not being solved correctly.

3. **Correct Joint Values**:
   - The correct joint values provided in the feedback can be used to refine the solution. Specifically, the relationship between the joint angles and the desired position and orientation needs to be re-evaluated.

### Revised Approach:
To address the issues, we need to:
1. **Incorporate Orientation**:
   - The orientation of the TCP must be explicitly considered when solving for the joint angles. This requires using the desired orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \) in the calculations.

2. **Revisit the Kinematic Equations**:
   - The forward kinematics equations must be re-derived to ensure that both position and orientation are correctly modeled.

3. **Solve for Joint Angles**:
   - Use the desired position and orientation to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) simultaneously.

### Updated Derivation:
The TCP position and orientation are given by:
\[
x = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
\]
The orientation of the TCP is determined by the cumulative rotations of the joints:
- \( \theta_1 \) affects the rotation about the Z-axis.
- \( \theta_2 \) affects the rotation about the Y-axis.

From the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \), we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) as follows:
1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - Use the desired orientation \( r_z \) to determine the rotation about the Z-axis.
   - \( \theta_1 = r_z \).

2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Use the desired position \( p \) and the known value of \( \theta_1 \) to solve for \( \theta_2 \).
   - Rearrange the forward kinematics equations to isolate \( \theta_2 \).

### Implementation:
The updated implementation is as follows:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation components
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z-axis
    L2 = 0.0823   # Offset along Y-axis
    
    # Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = r_z  # Use the desired orientation about the Z-axis
    
    # Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(z - L1, r)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Orientation Handling**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is explicitly incorporated into the solution by using \( r_z \) to determine \( \theta_1 \).

2. **Position Handling**:
   - The position equations are used to solve for \( \theta_2 \), ensuring that the TCP reaches the desired position.

3. **Simplified Approach**:
   - The solution leverages the provided orientation directly, simplifying the computation of \( \theta_1 \).

This revised implementation should address the issues identified in the feedback and produce the correct joint values for the given test cases.
