To solve the inverse kinematics for the given 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p \) and orientation \( r \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - The TCP position is given as \( p = [x, y, z] \).
   - The TCP orientation is given as \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \).
   - The manipulator has two revolute joints:
     - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
     - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.

2. **Forward Kinematics Recap**:
   - The TCP position in the forward kinematics is:
     \[
     \text{TCP Position} = [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]
     \]
   - The TCP orientation in the forward kinematics is:
     \[
     \text{TCP Orientation} = [0, 0, \frac{\pi}{2}]
     \]

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Use the provided sub-solutions for each joint:
     - **Existing Code 1**: Solves for \( \theta_1 \) based on the position \( p \).
     - **Existing Code 2**: Solves for \( \theta_2 \) based on the position \( p \).

4. **Combine the Solutions**:
   - Use the sub-solutions to compute \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) for the given \( p \) and \( r \).

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for theta1 using Existing Code 1
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Adjust the target position for the second joint
    # Subtract the contribution of the first joint
    adjusted_x = x
    adjusted_y = y - 0.0823  # TCP offset in y-direction
    adjusted_z = z - 0.09465  # TCP offset in z-direction
    
    # Solve for theta2 using Existing Code 2
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation:
1. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - Use the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of the target position \( p \) to compute \( \theta_1 \) using the formula:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
     \]

2. **Adjust for Theta2**:
   - Subtract the offsets introduced by the TCP position to isolate the contribution of \( \theta_2 \).
   - Use the adjusted coordinates to compute \( \theta_2 \) using the formula:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(\text{adjusted\_x}, \text{adjusted\_z})
     \]

3. **Return the Results**:
   - Return \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) as a tuple.

This solution ensures that the manipulator reaches the desired position and orientation.
