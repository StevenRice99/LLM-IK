The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still incorrect and fails to reach the desired positions and orientations. The primary issues are:

1. **Incorrect Orientation Handling**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is not being properly incorporated into the solution. The computed joint angles do not align with the desired orientation.

2. **Position Mismatch**:
   - The computed positions are rotated versions of the desired positions, indicating that the orientation is affecting the position calculations.

3. **Incorrect Joint Values**:
   - The joint values produced by the code are far from the correct values provided in the feedback.

### Key Observations:
- The correct joint values provided in the feedback show that both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) need to be solved simultaneously to account for both position and orientation.
- The current approach of using \( r_z \) directly as \( \theta_1 \) is incorrect. Instead, \( \theta_1 \) must be derived from the desired position and orientation.

### Revised Approach:
To address these issues, we need to:
1. **Revisit the Kinematic Equations**:
   - The forward kinematics equations must be re-derived to ensure that both position and orientation are correctly modeled.

2. **Incorporate Orientation**:
   - The desired orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \) must be explicitly used to solve for the joint angles.

3. **Simultaneous Solution**:
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) simultaneously using both the position and orientation equations.

### Updated Derivation:
The TCP position and orientation are given by:
\[
x = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
\]
The orientation of the TCP is determined by the cumulative rotations of the joints:
- \( \theta_1 \) affects the rotation about the Z-axis.
- \( \theta_2 \) affects the rotation about the Y-axis.

From the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \), we can solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) as follows:
1. **Solve for \( \theta_1 \)**:
   - Use the desired position \( p \) to determine the rotation about the Z-axis.
   - \( \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x) \).

2. **Solve for \( \theta_2 \)**:
   - Use the desired position \( p \) and the known value of \( \theta_1 \) to solve for \( \theta_2 \).
   - Rearrange the forward kinematics equations to isolate \( \theta_2 \).

### Implementation:
The updated implementation is as follows:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation components
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Offset along Z-axis
    L2 = 0.0823   # Offset along Y-axis
    
    # Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)  # Radial distance in the XY-plane
    theta2 = math.atan2(z - L1, r)
    
    # Adjust theta1 and theta2 based on the desired orientation
    theta1 += r_z
    theta2 += r_y
    
    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Orientation Handling**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is explicitly incorporated into the solution by adjusting \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) based on \( r_z \) and \( r_y \), respectively.

2. **Position Handling**:
   - The position equations are used to solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), ensuring that the TCP reaches the desired position.

3. **Simultaneous Solution**:
   - Both position and orientation are solved simultaneously by combining the equations.

This revised implementation should address the issues identified in the feedback and produce the correct joint values for the given test cases.
