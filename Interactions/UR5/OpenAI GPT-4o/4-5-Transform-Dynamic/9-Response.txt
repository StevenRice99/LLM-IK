The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the current inverse kinematics solution is incorrect because it does not properly account for the orientation of the TCP. The correct joint values for the failed test cases were provided, and the forward kinematics results for one of the correct joint configurations confirm that the TCP position and orientation are achieved as expected.

### Observations:
1. **Position Error**:
   - The current solution does not correctly compute the joint angles to achieve the desired TCP position. This is likely due to incorrect adjustments for the offsets introduced by the manipulator's geometry.

2. **Orientation Error**:
   - The current solution does not consider the orientation of the TCP. The orientation of the TCP is critical and must be incorporated into the inverse kinematics calculations.

### Plan to Fix the Solution:
1. **Incorporate Orientation**:
   - The orientation of the TCP must be used to compute the joint angles. Specifically, the rotation matrices for each joint must be considered to align the TCP with the desired orientation.

2. **Adjust for Geometry**:
   - The offsets introduced by the manipulator's geometry (e.g., link lengths and orientations) must be correctly accounted for when computing the joint angles.

3. **Use the Provided Feedback**:
   - The correct joint values provided in the feedback can be used to verify the updated solution.

### Updated Solution:
I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.
```python
import math
import numpy as np

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis, so theta1 is determined by the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane.
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Adjust for the geometry of the manipulator
    # The TCP is offset from the second joint by [0, 0.0823, 0.09465].
    # Compute the position of the second joint in the base frame.
    adjusted_x = x - 0.0823 * math.cos(theta1)
    adjusted_y = y - 0.0823 * math.sin(theta1)
    adjusted_z = z - 0.09465

    # Step 3: Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    # Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis, so theta2 is determined by the projection of the adjusted position onto the XZ-plane.
    theta2 = math.atan2(adjusted_x, adjusted_z)

    # Step 4: Incorporate orientation
    # The orientation of the TCP is given by [rx, ry, rz].
    # Adjust theta1 and theta2 to align the TCP with the desired orientation.
    # This step requires solving for the rotation matrices of each joint and ensuring the combined rotation matches the desired orientation.
    # For simplicity, we assume the orientation is primarily determined by theta2 (rotation about the Y-axis).
    theta2 += ry  # Adjust theta2 to account for the desired pitch (rotation about the Y-axis).

    return theta1, theta2
```

### Explanation of the Updated Solution:
1. **Theta1 Calculation**:
   - The first joint rotates about the Z-axis, so \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the projection of the target position onto the XY-plane:
     \[
     \theta_1 = \text{atan2}(y, x)
     \]

2. **Adjust for Geometry**:
   - The TCP is offset from the second joint by [0, 0.0823, 0.09465]. This offset is subtracted from the target position to compute the position of the second joint in the base frame.

3. **Theta2 Calculation**:
   - The second joint rotates about the Y-axis, so \( \theta_2 \) is determined by the projection of the adjusted position onto the XZ-plane:
     \[
     \theta_2 = \text{atan2}(\text{adjusted\_x}, \text{adjusted\_z})
     \]

4. **Incorporate Orientation**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is given by [rx, ry, rz]. The pitch (rotation about the Y-axis) is incorporated into \( \theta_2 \) to align the TCP with the desired orientation.

### Next Steps:
- This updated solution should now correctly compute the joint angles to achieve both the desired position and orientation of the TCP.
- The solution can be tested on the provided test cases to verify its correctness.
