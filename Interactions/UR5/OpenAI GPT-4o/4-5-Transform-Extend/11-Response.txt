The feedback indicates that the current implementation is still failing to compute the correct joint angles for both position and orientation. The primary issues are:

1. **Position Mismatch**: The TCP position is not being correctly aligned with the target position in all cases.
2. **Orientation Mismatch**: The TCP orientation is not being correctly aligned with the target orientation. The orientation is influenced by both joint angles, and the current implementation does not fully account for this.
3. **Incorrect Corrections**: The corrections applied to the joint angles are not producing the desired results.

### Observations:
- The correct joint values provided in the feedback show that both \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) need to be adjusted to achieve the correct position and orientation.
- The orientation mismatch suggests that the rotational transformations of both joints are not being properly considered.
- The position mismatch suggests that the forward kinematics equations are not being correctly inverted.

### Plan to Fix the Issues:
1. **Revisit the Forward Kinematics**:
   - The forward kinematics equations need to be inverted to solve for the joint angles.
   - The position and orientation of the TCP are determined by the combined transformations of both joints.

2. **Update the Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Use the target position and orientation to compute the joint angles.
   - Ensure that both the position and orientation constraints are satisfied.

3. **Incorporate Orientation into the Solution**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the rotations of both joints.
   - Use the target orientation to compute the required joint angles.

4. **Test and Refine**:
   - Test the updated solution on the provided test cases.
   - Refine the solution based on the results.

I will now update the inverse kinematics function to incorporate these changes.

    ])
    
    # Compute the error between the current and target orientations
    R_error = np.dot(R_target, R_current.T)
    
    # Extract the correction angles from the error matrix
    theta_1_correction = math.atan2(R_error[1, 0], R_error[0, 0])
    theta_2_correction = math.atan2(R_error[2, 1], R_error[2, 2])

```

This updated function uses the target orientation to refine the joint angles. It computes the error between the current and target orientations and applies corrections to the joint angles. This should resolve the issues with both position and orientation mismatches.
