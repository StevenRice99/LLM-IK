To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (for Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (for Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Understand the Forward Kinematics**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by the two revolute joints.
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis, and Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.

2. **Decompose the Problem**:
   - First, solve for \( \theta_1 \) using the projection of the TCP position onto the X-Y plane.
   - Then, solve for \( \theta_2 \) using the Z-axis position and the orientation constraint.

3. **Use Geometry and Trigonometry**:
   - Use the given TCP position and orientation to derive equations for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \).

4. **Implement the Solution**:
   - Use the provided Python function to compute the joint angles.

Now, I will proceed to implement the solution.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    _, _, r_z = r  # Only the Z-axis orientation is relevant for this manipulator

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 (Revolute 1)
    # Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis, so we use the projection of the TCP onto the X-Y plane
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 (Revolute 2)
    # Adjust the target position to account for the offset introduced by Revolute 2
    # The TCP position relative to Revolute 2's frame is:
    # [0, 0.0823, 0] (TCP position in local frame)
    # [0, 0, 0.09465] (Revolute 2 position in local frame)
    # The effective length of the arm in the Y-Z plane is:
    l_tcp = 0.0823  # TCP offset in Y
    l_r2 = 0.09465  # Revolute 2 offset in Z

    # Compute the effective position of the TCP in the Y-Z plane
    y_eff = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2) - l_tcp  # Effective Y position
    z_eff = z - l_r2  # Effective Z position

    # Use trigonometry to solve for theta2
    theta2 = math.atan2(z_eff, y_eff)

    # Return the joint angles
    return theta1, theta2
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired position \( p \) and orientation \( r \). It uses trigonometric relationships to solve for the angles based on the manipulator's geometry.
