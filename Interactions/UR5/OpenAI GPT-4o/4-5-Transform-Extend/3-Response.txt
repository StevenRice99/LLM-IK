To solve the inverse kinematics for the 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that position the TCP (Tool Center Point) at the desired position \( p \) and orientation \( r \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### Step 1: Analyze the Forward Kinematics
From the forward kinematics, the TCP position is given as:
\[ \text{TCP Position} = [0, 0.0823, 0.09465] \]
This is the result of the combined transformations of the two revolute joints.

### Step 2: Decompose the Problem
The manipulator has two revolute joints:
1. **Revolute 1** rotates about the Z-axis.
2. **Revolute 2** rotates about the Y-axis.

The TCP position is influenced by both joint angles. The orientation of the TCP is fixed at \( [0, 0, \frac{\pi}{2}] \), which simplifies the problem since we only need to solve for the position.

### Step 3: Use Geometry to Solve for Joint Angles
The TCP position can be expressed in terms of the joint angles:
1. The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) determines the rotation in the XY-plane.
2. The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) determines the elevation of the TCP along the Z-axis.

The position of the TCP in the manipulator's workspace can be written as:
\[
x = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
\]
\[
y = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
\]
\[
z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
\]
Where:
- \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) (length of the first link),
- \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) (length of the second link).

### Step 4: Solve for \( \theta_1 \)
The first joint angle \( \theta_1 \) can be determined using the projection of the TCP onto the XY-plane:
\[
\theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( \theta_2 \)
The second joint angle \( \theta_2 \) can be determined using the Z-coordinate of the TCP:
\[
z = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
\]
Rearranging for \( \theta_2 \):
\[
\cos(\theta_2) = \frac{z - L_1}{L_2}
\]
\[
\theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{z - L_1}{L_2}\right)
\]

### Step 6: Implement the Solution
Now, I will implement the solution in the provided Python function.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Length of the first link
    L2 = 0.0823   # Length of the second link
    
    # Solve for theta_1
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Solve for theta_2
    cos_theta_2 = (z - L1) / L2
    theta_2 = math.acos(cos_theta_2)
    
    return theta_1, theta_2
```

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) required to position the TCP at the desired location \( p \). The orientation \( r \) is fixed and does not influence the solution.
