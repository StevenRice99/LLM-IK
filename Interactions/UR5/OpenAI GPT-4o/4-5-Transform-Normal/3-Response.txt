To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Forward Kinematics Recap**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset from the second joint by a fixed distance along the Y-axis and Z-axis.

2. **Position Analysis**:
   - The TCP position in the global frame is determined by the rotations of the two joints and the fixed link lengths.
   - Using trigonometry, we can express the TCP position as:
     \[
     x_{TCP} = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \cos(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     y_{TCP} = L_2 \sin(\theta_2) \sin(\theta_1)
     \]
     \[
     z_{TCP} = L_1 + L_2 \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     where:
     - \( L_1 = 0.09465 \) (distance along Z-axis from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2),
     - \( L_2 = 0.0823 \) (distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Y-axis).

3. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the rotation matrices of the two joints. However, since the TCP's orientation is fixed relative to the second joint, we only need to ensure that the given orientation \( r \) matches the expected orientation.

4. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   - Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using the given \( p = [x, y, z] \):
     - From \( x \) and \( y \), calculate \( \theta_1 \) using:
       \[
       \theta_1 = \arctan2(y, x)
       \]
     - From \( z \), calculate \( \theta_2 \) using:
       \[
       \theta_2 = \arccos\left(\frac{z - L_1}{L_2}\right)
       \]

Now, I will implement this logic in the provided Python function.
