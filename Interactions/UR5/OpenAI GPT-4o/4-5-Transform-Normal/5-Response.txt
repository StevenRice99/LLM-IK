To solve the inverse kinematics for this 2-DOF manipulator, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) (Revolute 1) and \( \theta_2 \) (Revolute 2) that position the TCP at the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [rx, ry, rz] \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Forward Kinematics Recap**:
   - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z-axis.
   - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The TCP is offset by a fixed distance along the Y-axis and Z-axis relative to Revolute 2.

2. **TCP Position**:
   The TCP position in the global frame is determined by the joint angles and the link lengths. From the forward kinematics:
   \[
   x_{TCP} = 0
   \]
   \[
   y_{TCP} = 0.0823 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)
   \]
   \[
   z_{TCP} = 0.09465 + 0.0823 \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
   \]

3. **Inverse Kinematics**:
   Given the target position \( p = [x, y, z] \), we solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \):
   - From the geometry, \( \theta_1 \) is determined by the rotation about the Z-axis. Since \( x_{TCP} = 0 \), \( \theta_1 = 0 \).
   - For \( \theta_2 \), we use the equations for \( y_{TCP} \) and \( z_{TCP} \):
     \[
     y = 0.0823 \cdot \cos(\theta_2)
     \]
     \[
     z = 0.09465 + 0.0823 \cdot \sin(\theta_2)
     \]

   Rearrange these equations to solve for \( \theta_2 \):
   \[
   \cos(\theta_2) = \frac{y}{0.0823}
   \]
   \[
   \sin(\theta_2) = \frac{z - 0.09465}{0.0823}
   \]

   Use the arctangent function to compute \( \theta_2 \):
   \[
   \theta_2 = \arctan2\left(\frac{z - 0.09465}{0.0823}, \frac{y}{0.0823}\right)
   \]

4. **Orientation**:
   The orientation of the TCP is fixed at \( [0, 0, \frac{\pi}{2}] \), so no additional computation is needed for orientation.

### Python Implementation:
Here is the completed Python function:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Solve for theta1 (rotation about Z-axis)
    theta1 = 0  # Since x = 0, no rotation about Z-axis is needed

    # Solve for theta2 (rotation about Y-axis)
    cos_theta2 = y / 0.0823
    sin_theta2 = (z - 0.09465) / 0.0823
    theta2 = math.atan2(sin_theta2, cos_theta2)

    return theta1, theta2
```

This function computes the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to position the TCP at the desired location.
