The feedback and forward kinematics results indicate that the current implementation of the inverse kinematics function is not correctly solving for the joint angles. The primary issue lies in the incorrect handling of the orientation and the TCP position. The forward kinematics results for the correct joint values confirm that the TCP position and orientation can be achieved, so the inverse kinematics must be adjusted to account for the orientation and the correct transformation of the TCP.

### Observations:
1. **Orientation Handling**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is not being considered in the current implementation. The orientation of the TCP is influenced by both joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \), and this must be incorporated into the solution.

2. **Position Handling**:
   - The TCP position is being calculated incorrectly due to the lack of proper transformation matrices. The forward kinematics results show that the TCP position is influenced by both joint angles, and this must be accounted for in the inverse kinematics.

### Plan:
To fix the inverse kinematics function:
1. Use the forward kinematics equations to derive the relationship between the joint angles and the TCP position and orientation.
2. Solve for \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) using the given TCP position and orientation.

I will now revise the inverse kinematics function to address these issues.

### Revised Implementation:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A list of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract the target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r
    
    # Link lengths
    L1 = 0.09465  # Distance along Z-axis from Revolute 1 to Revolute 2
    L2 = 0.0823   # Distance from Revolute 2 to TCP along Y-axis
    
    # Calculate theta_1 (Revolute 1 angle)
    theta_1 = math.atan2(y, x)
    
    # Calculate theta_2 (Revolute 2 angle)
    # Adjust for the z-offset (L1) and the projection of the TCP position onto the YZ-plane
    cos_theta_2 = (z - L1) / L2
    theta_2 = math.acos(cos_theta_2)
    
    # Adjust theta_1 and theta_2 based on the orientation
    theta_1 += rz
    theta_2 += rx
    
    # Return the joint angles
    return theta_1, theta_2
``` 

This revised implementation incorporates the orientation into the calculation of the joint angles. It adjusts the joint angles based on the given orientation of the TCP. This should resolve the issues identified in the feedback.
