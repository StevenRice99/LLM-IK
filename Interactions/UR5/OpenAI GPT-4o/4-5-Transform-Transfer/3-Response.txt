To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) that satisfy both the target position \( p \) and orientation \( r \). Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Position Analysis**:
   - The TCP position is influenced by both revolute joints.
   - The existing solution for position-only inverse kinematics provides a starting point for \( \theta_1 \) based on the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of the target position.

2. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is determined by the cumulative rotations of the two revolute joints.
   - The TCP's final orientation is given as \( [0, 0, 1.570796325] \) (90 degrees about the Z-axis in radians). This must be matched by the sum of the joint rotations.

3. **Combining Position and Orientation**:
   - Use the position-only solution to calculate \( \theta_1 \).
   - Use the orientation constraint to calculate \( \theta_2 \) such that the total orientation matches the target.

I will now complete the Python function to solve for both position and orientation.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the joints to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    _, _, target_orientation_z = r  # Only Z-axis orientation is relevant

    # Step 1: Solve for theta1 using position
    theta1 = math.atan2(-x, y)

    # Step 2: Solve for theta2 using orientation
    # The total orientation of the TCP is the sum of the joint rotations
    # Orientation of TCP = theta1 + theta2
    theta2 = target_orientation_z - theta1

    return (theta1, theta2)
``` 

This function calculates the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) to achieve both the target position and orientation. It uses the provided position-only solution for \( \theta_1 \) and adjusts \( \theta_2 \) to match the desired orientation.
