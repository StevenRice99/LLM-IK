To solve the inverse kinematics for both position and orientation, we need to determine the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) such that the end-effector (TCP) reaches the desired position \( p = [x, y, z] \) and orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \).

### Step-by-Step Plan:
1. **Position Analysis**:
   - Use the provided position-only solution to calculate \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) for the given position \( p \).
   - This involves transforming the target position into the robot's coordinate system and solving for the joint angles.

2. **Orientation Analysis**:
   - The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the second joint (Revolute 2), which rotates about the Y-axis.
   - The desired orientation \( r = [r_x, r_y, r_z] \) specifies the roll, pitch, and yaw angles. For this robot, only the yaw angle \( r_z \) is relevant since the TCP's orientation is primarily affected by the second joint.

3. **Combine Position and Orientation**:
   - Adjust \( \theta_2 \) to account for the desired orientation \( r_z \), ensuring the TCP aligns with the target orientation.

Let me now complete the function.
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: A tuple of the values to set the links to for reaching position "p" and orientation "r".
    """
    # Extract position and orientation components
    x, y, z = p
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # Step 1: Solve for position (theta1 and theta2 for position only)
    x_prime = y  # Transform target position into the robot's coordinate system
    y_prime = -x
    z_prime = z

    # Calculate theta1 using atan2
    theta1 = math.atan2(y_prime, x_prime)

    # Step 2: Solve for orientation (adjust theta2 for desired orientation)
    # The orientation of the TCP is influenced by the second joint (Revolute 2)
    # The desired orientation is given by r_z (yaw angle)
    # Since the TCP's orientation is [0, 0, 1.570796325] in the forward kinematics,
    # we need to adjust theta2 to account for the difference between the desired r_z and this value.
    theta2 = r_z - 1.570796325  # Subtract the fixed orientation offset

    return (theta1, theta2)
``` 

### Explanation:
1. **Position Calculation**:
   - The position-only solution is reused to calculate \( \theta_1 \) based on the target position \( p \).
   - \( \theta_1 \) is determined using the `atan2` function, which computes the angle of the vector in the XY-plane.

2. **Orientation Adjustment**:
   - The TCP's default orientation in the forward kinematics is \( [0, 0, 1.570796325] \) (90 degrees about the Z-axis).
   - To align the TCP with the desired orientation \( r_z \), we adjust \( \theta_2 \) by subtracting the fixed offset \( 1.570796325 \).

3. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns the joint angles \( \theta_1 \) and \( \theta_2 \) in radians, which achieve both the desired position and orientation.
