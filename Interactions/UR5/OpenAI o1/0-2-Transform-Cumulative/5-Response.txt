    """
    Closed-form inverse kinematics for a 3-DOF arm with joints:
       Joint 1: Revolute about Z
       Joint 2: Revolute about Y
       Joint 3: Revolute about Y
    Link offsets from the URDF ("DETAILS" section):
       • Joint 1 at [0, 0, 0]
       • Joint 2 at [0, 0.13585, 0]
       • Joint 3 at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
       • TCP    at [0, 0, 0.39225]
    All r = [rx, ry, rz] are roll-pitch-yaw in the order (X, Y, Z) but the arm can only realize
    yaw = q1 and pitch = q2 + q3 (it has no independent roll). This solution forces:
       q1 = rz
       q2 + q3 = ry
    Then solves for position p = [x, y, z].
    """

    # Unpack target position and orientation
    x, y, z = p
    rx, ry, rz = r  # roll, pitch, yaw

    # 1) For orientation, the manipulator can only perform a yaw of q1 and a net pitch (q2 + q3).
    #    We match yaw = q1 = rz, and pitch = q2 + q3 = ry.
    q1 = rz
    alpha = ry  # q2 + q3

    # 2) Bring the target position into the "post–joint1" frame by undoing that yaw about Z,
    #    and also subtract the offset from the base to joint2, which is [0, 0.13585, 0].
    c1 = math.cos(q1)
    s1 = math.sin(q1)

    # Rotate [x, y, z] by Rz(-q1)
    x_local =  x*c1 + y*s1
    y_local = -x*s1 + y*c1
    z_local =  z

    # Subtract the link-2 offset in that local frame
    # Joint 2 is at [0, 0.13585, 0] from the base AFTER joint1. So remove it:
    y_local -= 0.13585

    # 3) Now we must solve for q2, q3 in a chain that rotates about Y twice and has two offsets:
    #       a) first offset from joint2 to joint3 is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    #       b) second offset from joint3 to the TCP is [0, 0, 0.39225]
    #
    #    In a local frame where the rotation axes are Y, the forward kinematics for joints 2 & 3
    #    (ignoring any roll about X) is effectively:
    #
    #    p_final = Ry(q2)*[0, -0.1197, 0.425] + Ry(q2+q3)*[0, 0, 0.39225].
    #
    #    Because rotation about Y leaves the y-component of any vector unchanged, we see that
    #    the final y is simply (-0.1197) from the first offset (the second offset is along z
    #    and doesn't affect y). This means the manipulator’s geometry only slightly shifts y
    #    (it does NOT allow big changes in y within that local frame).  In practice, the main
    #    variation of y in world-space comes from how q1 reorients the link.
    #
    #    We'll match p_local = [x_local, y_local, z_local] with that formula.
    #
    #    Let D2(θ) = Ry(θ)*[0, -0.1197, 0.425], D3(φ) = Ry(φ)*[0, 0, 0.39225].
    #    Then p_local = D2(q2) + D3(q2 + q3) = D2(q2) + D3(alpha).
    #
    #    We'll write it out explicitly:
    #
    #    D2(q2) = [0.425 sin(q2), -0.1197, 0.425 cos(q2)]
    #    D3(alpha) = [0.39225 sin(alpha), 0, 0.39225 cos(alpha)]
    #
    #    So
    #
    #        x_local = 0.425 sin(q2) + 0.39225 sin(alpha)
    #        y_local = -0.1197
    #        z_local = 0.425 cos(q2) + 0.39225 cos(alpha).
    #
    #    Notice that y_local must be -0.1197 for a consistent solution. If it differs, we won't have
    #    an exact solution. In reality, the real chain geometry plus the rotation about Z can
    #    place the end-effector at many (x,y,z) in the global frame, but in the local frame after
    #    removing q1, the manipulator is essentially a 2-link layout that does not vary local y
    #    except for that constant -0.1197 shift. We'll proceed with that direct approach:
    #

    # Check if the local Y is close to the needed -0.1197:
    # If it is not, the manip may never precisely match. We'll just proceed and rely on small errors.
    # Solve for q2 from the planar equations in xz. Then q3 = alpha - q2.
    # x_local = 0.425 sin(q2) + 0.39225 sin(alpha)
    # z_local = 0.425 cos(q2) + 0.39225 cos(alpha)
    #
    # Rearrange to isolate q2. We can do it by standard 2-link approach or a simpler numeric search.
    # Since the instructions forbid "optimizers," we'll do a small direct approach:
    #
    #   Let X' = x_local - 0.39225 sin(alpha)
    #       Z' = z_local - 0.39225 cos(alpha)
    #   => X' = 0.425 sin(q2)
    #      Z' = 0.425 cos(q2)
    #
    #   => q2 = atan2(X', Z').
    #

    # alpha = q2 + q3, so once we have q2, q3 = alpha - q2.

    # Step A: define the "residual" we must explain by the link2 portion
    X_prime = x_local - 0.39225 * math.sin(alpha)
    Z_prime = z_local - 0.39225 * math.cos(alpha)

    # Step B: solve for q2
    q2 = math.atan2(X_prime, Z_prime)
    # Step C: q3 from alpha
    q3 = alpha - q2

    # Optional: If y_local is far from -0.1197, it's an indication that no perfect solution
    # exists under this simplified geometry. We'll keep going anyway.

    return (q1, q2, q3)
