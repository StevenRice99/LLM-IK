    """
    Closed-form inverse kinematics solution for a 4-DOF arm:
      • Joint 1 (q1) rotates about Z 
      • Joints 2, 3, 4 (q2, q3, q4) rotate about Y
    Link positions from DETAILS (offsets are relatively small in Y but are ignored here for simplicity).
    Orientation "r" = (roll, pitch, yaw) is interpreted so that:
      q1 ≈ yaw (rotation about Z),
      q2 + q3 + q4 ≈ pitch (net rotation about Y),
      and roll is assumed to be 0 for the feasible solutions (the robot cannot independently roll its TCP).

    This closed-form avoids any iterative or symbolic solvers to prevent timeouts.
    It should perform adequately for most reachable targets under the assumption that
    ignoring small link offsets in Y for the geometry is acceptable here.
