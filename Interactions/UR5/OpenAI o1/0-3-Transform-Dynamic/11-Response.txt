    Closed-form style solution using direct symbolic solving with Sympy.
    We construct the full forward kinematics, then solve the equations:
      [x_fk - x_target = 0,
       y_fk - y_target = 0,
       z_fk - z_target = 0,

       R_fk(1,2) - R_des(1,2) = 0,
       R_fk(2,2) - R_des(2,2) = 0]
    for the 4 unknowns q1..q4.

    Because the robot is 4-DOF (Z, Y, Y, Y) with the specified link offsets, we
    match the position and the final Z-axis of the end-effector orientation to
    the desired orientation. The user has stated all given targets will be
    reachable. This provides 6 equations for 4 unknowns, which typically
    determines a solution for a 4-DOF manipulator that can realize that subset
    of orientations.

    :param p: Target position [x, y, z].
    :param r: Target orientation in radians [roll, pitch, yaw].

Explanation of the approach:

1) We define the robot’s forward kinematics exactly, using symbolic math (Sympy), for the 4 joints and their respective offsets/axes from the “DETAILS” table.  
2) We build the desired orientation as a rotation matrix R_des from the provided RPY angles [roll, pitch, yaw], consistent with Rz(yaw)·Ry(pitch)·Rx(roll).  
3) Because the manipulator is 4-DOF, we cannot match all 9 elements of R_des, so we align only the tool’s Z-axis to R_des’s Z-axis (three orientation constraints) plus match the end-effector’s (x, y, z) position exactly (three position constraints). That yields six equations total.  
4) We use sp.solve to find real solutions (q1, q2, q3, q4). We assume there is at least one valid solution for each target, per the instructions.  
5) We pick the first solution from sp.solve and wrap each joint angle into (−π, π].  
6) Return these four joint angles.  

This provides a closed-form style symbolic approach that enforces both position and a consistent orientation axis for the 4-DOF manipulator.
