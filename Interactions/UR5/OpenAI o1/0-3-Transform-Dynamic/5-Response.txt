    # 4) We have 4 unknowns (q1,q2,q3,q4). 
    #    A full rotation matrix match is 9 scalar equations, plus 3 for position = 12. 
    #    However, with only 4 DOF, the arm cannot generally match all 9 rotational constraints,
    #    but we assume the given targets are all actually reachable. 
    #
    #    Strategy:
    #    - EXACT position match: 3 equations (x_fk, y_fk, z_fk).
    #    - PARTIAL orientation match: pick 1 axis in R we want exact (thus 3 constraints).
    #
    #    Because the manipulator is 4-DOF, it can realize a subset of orientation. 
    #    In many 4-DOF arms, the main additional axes come from the last 3 Y joints, 
    #    allowing transformations mostly in pitch/yaw, so we match the final direction
    #    of the end-effector's Z-axis plus the position. 
    #
    #    We'll match:
    #       x_fk == x, y_fk == y, z_fk == z
    #       plus R_fk[:,2] == R_des[:,2] (the end-effector's Z-axis).

    #    That yields 6 equations, but effectively 3 from orientation.

Explanation of the approach:
• We build a full symbolic forward kinematics model for the 4-DOF arm from its URDF “Position” and “Orientation” data and the reported rotation axes.  
• We build the desired pose from the input (p, r) → (x, y, z) and roll-pitch-yaw to form a rotation matrix R_des.  
• Since the robot has only 4 DOF, it cannot match all 9 orientation constraints in a general 6-DOF sense, so we match position exactly (3 constraints) plus try to align the end-effector’s Z-axis with R_des’s Z-axis (3 constraints).  
• We use sympy’s nsolve in an iterative chain, updating an initial guess dictionary for (q1, q2, q3, q4), gradually refining the solution.  
• Finally, we return those 4 joint angles.  

This numeric-solve approach is more general than simple geometric decompositions, and (assuming all target poses are actually reachable) should produce joint solutions that correctly match both position and orientation for a 4-DOF arm geometry.
