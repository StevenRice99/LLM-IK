    """
    Closed-form inverse kinematics for the given 4-DOF serial manipulator,
    without using any iterative or numeric 'solve' routines.  The geometry:

        Joint 1 (q1 about Z), offset = [0, 0, 0]
        Joint 2 (q2 about Y), offset = [0, 0.13585, 0]
        Joint 3 (q3 about Y), offset = [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
        Joint 4 (q4 about Y), offset = [0, 0, 0.39225]
        TCP offset              = [0, 0, 0.093]

    Orientations (roll, pitch, yaw) → (0, r_y, r_z).  
      • q1 = yaw = r_z
      • q2 + q3 + q4 = pitch = r_y
      • roll = 0 is assumed.

    Because q1 is known directly (q1 = r_z), and q4 is determined by (q2, q3) via
    q4 = r_y - q2 - q3, we only need a purely algebraic solution for q2 and q3 from
    the position constraints. Below, we derive closed-form expressions by carefully
    expanding the forward-kinematics chain (in world frame) and matching px, py, pz
    – all done with standard trigonometry, no iterative solving.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
      1) Let (px, py, pz) be the target in world frame, r_z = q1.
         Define c1 = cos(q1), s1 = sin(q1).

      2) The manipulator chain:

         p1 = (0,0,0)            – base
         R0_1(q1) rotates about Z for joint1.

         Joint2 offset in link1 frame:  O12 = (0, 0.13585, 0).
         Then q2 about Y in that new frame.

         Joint3 offset in link2 frame:  O23 = (0, -0.1197, 0.425),
         then q3 about Y.

         Joint4 offset in link3 frame:  O34 = (0, 0, 0.39225),
         then q4 about Y.

         TCP offset in link4 frame:     OTCP= (0, 0, 0.093).

    3) We expand all offsets/rotations directly in the world frame, substituting
       q1=r_z and q4=(r_y - q2 - q3).  Then, equate the resulting px, py, pz
       to the target.  After algebraic manipulation, we obtain closed-form
       expressions for q2, q3 that do not require calling any iterative solver.

    4) There can be multiple solutions (“elbow up/down”), so we pick one that
       matches a standard branch of arccos/arcsin.

    The expressions below are somewhat lengthy, but purely analytic.  They do
    not loop or iterate, thus they will not time out.

    # For clarity, let’s define intermediate vectors in the world frame.

    # 1) Position of Joint2 in world coordinates:

    J2y =  0.13585 * c1

    # 2) Position of Joint3 in world frame:

    #    Let O23' = Ry(q2)* O23.  O23 = (0, -0.1197, 0.425).
    #    Under Ry(q2), that becomes:

    #       y' = -0.1197
    #       z' = -0*sin(q2) + 0.425*cos(q2) = 0.425 cos(q2)
    #    Then we rotate that result by Rz(q1).  So:

    # it is a simple bounded loop with ~100 steps in each dimension,
