<INSTRUCTIONS>
You are tasked with producing a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 5 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator solving for the position of the TCP as detailed in the "DETAILS" section by completing the Python function provided in the "CODE" section. The "Position" and "Orientation" columns represent link coordinates in local space relative to their parent link. The positions are from the "xyz" attribute and the orientations are the "rpy" attribute from each link's "origin" element parsed from the URDF. The "Axis" column in the table represents the rotational axis of the revolute links; return their values in radians and their limits are in radians. Do not write any code to run or test the method, as this will be handled for you. Assume all targets given as inputs to the method will be reachable, and as such do not write code to check if the target is reachable. You may use any methods included in Python, NumPy, and SymPy to write your solution except for any optimization methods. To help you, solutions for sub-chains have been provided in the "EXISTING" sections. Each code solved a sub-link assuming their last link was the target being solved for. You can use these solutions as a starting point to extend for the entire chain. Existing code 1 solved joint 1. Existing code 2 solved joints 1 to 2. Existing code 3 solved joints 1 to 3. Existing code 4 solved joints 1 to 4. Existing code 5 solved joint 2. Existing code 6 solved joints 2 to 3. Existing code 7 solved joints 2 to 4. Existing code 8 solved joints 2 to 5. Existing code 9 solved joint 3. Existing code 10 solved joints 3 to 4. Existing code 11 solved joints 3 to 5. Existing code 12 solved joint 4. Existing code 13 solved joints 4 to 5. Existing code 14 solved joint 5. You may respond by either completing the inverse kinematics method or calling either of the two provided functions in the "FUNCTIONS" section to help you develop your solution. If you call a function, you will be provided another response and chance to complete the inverse kinematics method. You may only call a single function per response.

    """
    Analytical closed–form inverse kinematics for a 4-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    The robot chain (with all lengths in meters) is defined by:
      • Revolute 1 (axis Y) at the base.
      • A fixed translation from base to joint2: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
      • Revolute 2 about Y.
      • A fixed translation from joint2 to joint3: [0, 0, 0.39225]
      • Revolute 3 about Y.
      • A fixed translation from joint3 to joint4: [0, 0.093, 0]  
         (affecting only y)
      • Revolute 4 about Z.
      • A fixed translation from joint4 to TCP: [0, 0, 0.09465]
      
    In the x–z plane only the translations along z matter.
    If we “project” the kinematics into the x–z plane the effective chain is:
         x = L1*sin(θ1) + L2*sin(θ1+θ2) + L3*sin(θ1+θ2+θ3)
         z = L1*cos(θ1) + L2*cos(θ1+θ2) + L3*cos(θ1+θ2+θ3)
    with:
         L1 = 0.425      (from [0, -0.1197, 0.425])
         L2 = 0.39225    (from [0, 0, 0.39225])
         L3 = 0.09465    (from TCP translation [0, 0, 0.09465])
    and the fixed y coordinate is:
         y = -0.1197 + 0.093 = -0.0267.
    
    Note: These three joints (rotating about Y) yield a redundant (3R) system in the plane.
    We resolve the redundancy by picking the end–effector “orientation” in the x–z plane,
    T = θ1 + θ2 + θ3, from one of two natural choices:
         T = psi   or   T = psi + π,
    where psi = atan2(x, z). For each choice the 2R sub–chain from joints 1 and 2
    (which must reach the “wrist center” defined by subtracting L3 in the T direction)
    is solved in closed form.
    Finally joint 4 does not affect position so we set it to 0.
    
    The algorithm below computes both candidate solutions (using the two choices for T and
    the two solutions from the 2R IK of the wrist center) and selects the one whose forward
    kinematics best matches the target p.
    
    :param p: The target TCP position as (x, y, z). (For valid targets y should equal -0.0267.)
