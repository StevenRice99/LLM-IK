    """
    A direct symbolic closed–form (where possible) / analytic inverse kinematics solution
    for the 5–DOF serial manipulator described in the DETAILS.  This solver accounts for all
    link offsets, with joints:
        Joint1: Revolute about global Z
        Joint2: Revolute about local Y
        Joint3: Revolute about local Y
        Joint4: Revolute about local Y
        Joint5: Revolute about local Z

    Since only the end–effector position is specified (no orientation is requested),
    and because rotating joint5 about Z does not change the TCP position (its link
    offset goes purely along local Z from the revolve–5 frame), this DOF is redundant
    for position.  We therefore fix Joint5 = 0 in this solver.  That leaves four unknown
    angles (θ1..θ4) to satisfy three position constraints → a 1–DOF redundancy in general.
    We direct Sympy’s solver to find a symbolic expression.  The result typically yields
    multiple branches.  We pick the real solutions (and attempt to put them in −π..π).
    For the test examples given in the FEEDBACK, one of those branches should match
    the correct solution sets.

    IMPORTANT:
      • This solution can yield multiple valid branches.  We try to pick a “reasonable”
        one by minimal absolute angles, but you may adjust selection if you prefer a
        different branch (for instance, smaller or larger elbow angles).
      • Because of the robot geometry (offsets in Y) and 1–DOF redundancy, there is
        no single unique closed–form.  The code below chooses one consistent branch.
      • No reachability checks are performed (assume the target is reachable).
      • Joint limits are not enforced.

    :param p: Desired TCP position as (x, y, z).
    :return: (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5) in radians, each in [−π, π] with θ5=0.
