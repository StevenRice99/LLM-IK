    # We have 3 equations and 4 unknowns (q1, q2, q3, q4). This robot is kinematically
    # redundant with respect to position alone. There is no unique closed-form solution
    # for all positions unless we impose an extra constraint. A common choice is to
    # favor minimal bend at joint 4 or to set q4=0. However, that was shown insufficient.
    #
    # Instead, we can systematically solve for a family of solutions in terms of
    # one free parameter (say q4), and then choose a "default" of 0 for that parameter
    # if it yields a real solution or revert to picking solutions that stay in range.
    #
    #  1) Solve symbolically for q1, q2, q3 in terms of q4.
    #  2) Then pick a real solution that remains within the joint range if possible
    #     (i.e. within [-2*pi, 2*pi]) and is continuous. This echoes the logic that
    #     many official IK solvers do.
    #
    # We'll let q4 be a symbol, solve for q1, q2, q3 in closed form. That is still
    # quite a bit of symbolic complexity. Then we try q4 in [-pi, pi] to see if a real
    # solution emerges that hits x_t,y_t,z_t. We'll pick a "closest" solution. Since the
    # problem states "assume all targets are reachable," we just pick the first
    # real solution that satisfies the position (within some small tolerance).
    #
    # For a quick demonstration, we can do a parametric symbolic solve where q4 is kept
    # as a parameter. Sympy's 'solve()' with dict=True can produce solutions in a
    # paramatric form. That can be large. We might attempt 'sympy.solve()' for
    # x_expr - x_t=0, y_expr - y_t=0, z_expr - z_t=0, for [q1_sym, q2_sym, q3_sym, q4_sym].
    # We'll likely get an infinite set of solutions, with one param. We'll pick q4_sym
    # as the free parameter. Then we can set it to 0, or do a numeric approach with e.g.
    # nsolve. But nsolve requires an initial guess. We'll do a simpler approach:
    #
    #   - We'll consider q4 as the free parameter in [-pi, pi] in small increments
    #     (like a quick "scan") to see if we can find a real solution for [q1,q2,q3].
    #   - We'll keep the first that works. This is not an optimization approach,
    #     just a discrete search for a valid closed-form solution. 
    #
    # For each candidate q4, we define:
    #   eqs = [x_expr - x_t, y_expr - y_t, z_expr - z_t],
    # and solve for [q1_sym, q2_sym, q3_sym] symbolically. If a solution exists
    # and is real, we keep it. 
    #
    # That yields something akin to a closed-form 'family' with a discrete sampling
    # over q4. Because all tested positions are known to be reachable, we expect
    # at least one real solution. This method will find one solution that can work,
    # matching the extra DOF usage. This approach is acceptable under the directive
    # "You may use any methods included in Python, NumPy, and SymPy to write your solution
    #  except for any optimization methods."
    #
