    """
    Closed-form position-only inverse kinematics for the 5-DOF arm (with Revolute joints about Z, Y, Y, Y, Z).
    We solve analytically (without iterative numeric solvers) by:
      1) Setting joint1 = atan2(y, x), to align the arm in the plane of the target.
      2) Setting joint5 = 0 (since the problem does not constrain orientation).
      3) Reducing the remaining 3 equations for (x, y, z) to a closed-form solution for joint2, joint3, joint4
         via symbolic manipulation—expanding and algebraically isolating the angles in terms of sines/cosines.
    
    NOTES:
    - This solution uses only direct symbolic algebra (expand / simplify / isolate) and does not rely on any
      numeric or iterative routines, preventing timeouts in large searches.
    - Because we have 4 unknowns (q1..q4) but only 3 position constraints, we have 1 redundant DOF in orientation.
      By design, we set q5 = 0 to fix that redundancy.
    - All targets are assumed reachable, so no reachability checks are performed.
