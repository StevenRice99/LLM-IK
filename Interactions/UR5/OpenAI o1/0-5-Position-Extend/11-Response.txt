def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    A closed–form extension of the existing 5–DOF inverse kinematics solution
    to the 6–DOF chain (Z–Y–Y–Y–Z–Y), enforcing only the TCP position p=(x,y,z)
    and consistently setting the last joint (θ6) = 0 as indicated by the
    provided “correct” solutions.  Unlike the simpler 5–DOF version, we allow
    joint #5 (about Z) to be free in order to reach more of the workspace.

    OVERVIEW:
      • We first use the same 4–joint “subchain” solver as in the 5–DOF code
        (for joints #1..#4), but temporarily treat link #5 as if θ5 = 0 and
        link #6 + TCP as a net offset of L3=0.09465.  
        This yields an intermediate set of angles for (θ1..θ4).
      • Next, we refine θ5 with a direct geometric step: we compute the
        position of link #4 in world space from (θ1..θ4), then solve for θ5
        so that rotating the offset [0,0.093,0] + [0,0,0.09465] + [0,0.0823,0]
        about link #4’s local Z–axis (i.e. the same axis we used for joint #5)
        lands exactly at p.  This step has a direct planar solution in the
        local X–Y plane normal to link #4’s Z–axis.
      • We set θ6=0 in all solutions, matching the “correct” sample solutions.

    This solution is purely algebraic/trigonometric, using the same logic
    as the 5–DOF closed–form plus one extra planar step for θ5.

    :param p: The desired (x, y, z) TCP position in world coords.
    :return: A tuple (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5, θ6) in radians.
