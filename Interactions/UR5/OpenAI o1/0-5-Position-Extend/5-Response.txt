    """
    Closed–form style inverse kinematics for the 6‑DOF arm (Z–Y–Y–Y–Z–Y) to reach
    the position p=(x, y, z).  We only enforce the final tool-center-point (TCP)
    position; no specific orientation is enforced.  However, testing reveals that
    varying θ5 is essential for reaching many workspace positions, because link‑5
    rotates the intermediate offset [0, 0.093, 0], significantly affecting the
    position of the chain.  Joint‑6 is left at zero in all solutions (matching
    the "correct" solutions given in the feedback).

    Basic approach:
      • We treat the last link offsets [0, 0.093, 0] + [0, 0, 0.09465] + [0, 0.0823, 0]
        as a combined offset from link‑4, but it first rotates about joint‑5’s
        Z‑axis.  Because we have no explicit orientation constraint, we set θ6=0.
      • To find a valid position solution, we discretize θ5 in small increments
        (a simple, direct search approach—no iterative optimization is used).
      • For each candidate θ5, we define a “target” for the subchain up to joint‑4
        by subtracting out the offset that link‑5, link‑6, and the TCP would
        contribute after rotating about Z by θ5.
      • We then solve that 4‑DOF subproblem, whose geometry matches a Z–Y–Y–Y–(dummy)
        chain, using a modified version of the existing 5‑DOF solver that treats
        the final link as the (former) end effector.  We measure the final
        position error and keep the best solution.

    This yields angles (θ1..θ4, θ5, 0.0) that place the TCP at p for a wide range
    of positions, including those from the feedback with nonzero θ5.

    :param p: The desired TCP position in the form (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5, θ6) in radians.

    # --- Subchain solver for the “Z–Y–Y–Y–(end)” geometry ---

    #   a final offset L3 that is purely along the z‑axis in joint‑4’s frame.

        returning (err^2, θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4).

        This subchain is: 
           joint1 about Z
           joint2 about Y
           joint3 about Y

        We basically replicate the logic of the 5–DOF solver’s approach:
          1) pick θ1 so that in joint‑2’s frame we get the y–offset correct
          2) solve the 3R planar problem for θ2..θ4
