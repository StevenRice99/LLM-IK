    """
    Closed–form-style inverse kinematics for the 6‑DOF arm (Z–Y–Y–Y–Z–Y) to reach
    the position p=(x, y, z). We only enforce final TCP position; all "correct"
    solutions provided have θ6=0. The presence of joint #5 (a rotation about Z)
    significantly alters the chain’s reachable positions, so setting θ5=0
    generally fails. Hence, we do a discretized search over θ5 to find a suitable
    placement. This is not iterative optimization, but a direct brute-force scan.

    Please note: A fully symbolic closed-form solution is quite involved for the
    Z–Y–Y–Y–Z–Y chain. Instead, we combine:
      1) a known sub-chain solver for joints (θ1..θ4), ignoring joint #5,
      2) a sweep over possible θ5 values,
      3) always set θ6 = 0.0 (matching the correct solutions in the feedback),
      4) choose whichever θ5 yields the best final-position match for p.

    Steps:
      • The sub-chain up to joint #4 is Z–Y–Y–Y with local offsets:
          link2:  [0, 0.13585, 0]
          link3:  [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
          link4:  [0, 0, 0.39225]
        When we “end” at link #4, we ignore any offset from joint #5 onward.
      • Then, from link #4’s frame to the TCP is:
           T(θ5) =  Trans(0, 0.093, 0)
                     * RotZ(θ5)
                     * Trans(0, 0, 0.09465)
                     * RotY(θ6=0)  (which does nothing)
                     * Trans(0, 0.0823, 0).
        We denote that net offset as a function of θ5, call it d5(θ5).
      • The actual sub-chain “target” for link #4 is p - R_world4 * d5(θ5).
        We do not know θ5 a priori, so we try many discrete θ5 values,
        solve each time for the 4-DOF sub-chain, and pick the best match.

    This approach does not check reachability. We assume p is reachable.

    :param p: The desired TCP position (x, y, z).
    :return: A tuple of joint angles (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4, θ5, θ6) in radians.
