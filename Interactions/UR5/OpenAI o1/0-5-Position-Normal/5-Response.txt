    This solution uses SymPy to construct a symbolic forward-kinematics model of the
    robot (including its fixed end-effector orientation) and then solves the resulting
    system of equations for the six joint angles in closed form. All targets [x, y, z]
    are assumed to be reachable. The orientation of the TCP is always fixed at
    RPY = [0, 0, π/2].
