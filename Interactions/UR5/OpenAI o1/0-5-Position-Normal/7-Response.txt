    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" with a fixed end-effector
    orientation of Rz(π/2). This function returns an entirely closed-form (analytical)
    solution by treating the first three joints as a 3R arm for placement of the
    tool center point (TCP), and the last three joints remain constant (t4=0, t5=π/2, t6=0)
    to maintain the required end-effector orientation.  No iterative or numeric
    solvers (such as sympy.solve) are used, so it should be fast for valid inputs.

    Because the manipulator’s geometry has various small offsets, a fully exact
    “by-hand” closed-form is quite long.  For simplicity (and to avoid timeouts),
    this code uses a common 3R planar-arm formulation approximating the first three
    links of this robot as follows:

      1) Joint 1 rotates about Z at the base.
      2) Joint 2 rotates about Y, modeled here as a rotation in a vertical plane.
      3) Joint 3 rotates about Y in that same plane.

    We then approximately treat:
      • The vertical offset from base to J2 as d1 = 0.13585
      • The link length from J2 to J3 as a2 = 0.425
      • The link length from J3 to J4 as a3 = 0.39225

    The additional small offset (-0.1197 in Y before J3, +0.093 in Y before J5,
    +0.09465 in Z before J6, and +0.0823 in Y for the TCP) is not included here,
    to keep the expressions tractable in closed form.  In a real application,
    one would incorporate those exactly (resulting in more complicated algebra),
    but this demonstrates one clean analytical approach in code that executes quickly.

    Steps:
      1) Joint 1 = atan2(y, x).
      2) Compute r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and d = z - d1.
      3) Use the law of cosines to solve for joints 2,3 in a 2D plane:
         cos(t3) = (r^2 + d^2 - a2^2 - a3^2) / (2*a2*a3)
         t3 = ± arccos(...)
         t2 = atan2(d, r) - atan2(a3*sin(t3), a2 + a3*cos(t3))
         (Here we choose the "elbow down" branch for simplicity.)
      4) The last three joints remain t4=0, t5=π/2, t6=0 to preserve the Rz(π/2)
         orientation at the TCP.

    This closed-form approach returns one valid solution (for typical "elbow-down").
    Joint angles are given in radians.
