    A revised closed-form symbolic IK solution for the 5-DOF serial manipulator specified in the DETAILS table.

    NOTE: The previous attempt used “Existing code #2” for a different geometry than specified,
    leading to incorrect solutions for certain targets. Here, we derive a direct solution that
    matches the actual link geometry:

      - Joint 1: Revolute about Y, at the base frame.
      - Joint 2: Revolute about Y, offset [0, -0.1197, 0.425] from Joint 1.
      - Joint 3: Revolute about Y, offset [0, 0, 0.39225] from Joint 2.
      - Joint 4: Revolute about Z, offset [0, 0.093, 0] from Joint 3.
      - Joint 5: Revolute about Y, offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from Joint 4.
      - TCP:      offset [0, 0.0823, 0] + a fixed rotation about Z by +1.570796325 (i.e. +90°).

    We use Sympy to derive a symbolic closed-form solution by equating:
       ForwardKinematics(q1..q5) = Desired(p, r)
    (where r is [roll, pitch, yaw] in URDF convention: Rz(yaw)*Ry(pitch)*Rx(roll))

    This code attempts to solve for (q1..q5). If multiple solutions exist, we pick one set
    (the principal values) for demonstration. In many 5-DOF arms, there may be multiple
    valid solutions. This approach does not do limit checking or search over “branches,”
    but should at least compute a self-consistent solution.

    WARNING: Symbolic solving for 5 unknowns can be somewhat slow or yield complicated
    expressions. In a real system, you might prefer a more carefully derived closed-form
    or a fast numeric method. For the sake of this exercise, we illustrate how it can be
    done in pure Python + Sympy.
