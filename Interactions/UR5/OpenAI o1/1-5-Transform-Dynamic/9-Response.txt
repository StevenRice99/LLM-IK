    """
    A purely analytical inverse kinematics solution for the specified 5-DOF manipulator,
    leveraging the same sub-chain approach as in "EXISTING 1" and "EXISTING 2," but
    carefully matching the geometry from the table:

        Joint 1: Revolute about Y, base at [0,0,0].
        Joint 2: Revolute about Y, at offset [0, -0.1197, 0.425] from Joint 1.
        Joint 3: Revolute about Y, at offset [0, 0, 0.39225] from Joint 2.
        Joint 4: Revolute about Z, at offset [0, 0.093, 0] from Joint 3.
        Joint 5: Revolute about Y, at offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from Joint 4.
        TCP:     offset [0, 0.0823, 0] and +90° about Z (1.570796325).

    Strategy:
      1) Solve Joint 1 (q1) from the top view: q1 = atan2(x, z).
      2) Transform the target (p, r) into the coordinate frame of Joint 2.
         That transform is T_base->joint1(q1) * Trans(0, -0.1197, 0.425).
         We invert that and apply it to (p, r).
      3) Solve the resulting 4-DOF sub-problem (joints q2..q5) about (Y, Y, Z, Y)
         using closed-form geometry. This follows the style of “EXISTING 2,”
         but with correct link lengths:
            - After Joint 2 (Y), an offset 0.39225 along Z (to Joint 3).
            - After Joint 3 (Y), an offset 0.093 along Y (to Joint 4).
            - After Joint 4 (Z), an offset 0.09465 along Z (to Joint 5).
            - After Joint 5 (Y), an offset 0.0823 along ? plus the final +90° about Z.
         We match orientation by searching over the ±arccos possibilities for the
         relevant angles and picking the candidate that best matches the target orientation.
      4) Return (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5) in radians.

    :param p: The desired TCP position [x, y, z].
    :param r: The desired TCP orientation [roll, pitch, yaw] in radians (URDF rpy).
    :return: A tuple (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5) that places the TCP at (p, r).
