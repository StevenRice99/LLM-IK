    A direct closed-form solution that properly accounts for the non-trivial link offsets:

      • Link 1: Revolute about Y at the base (no initial translation).
      • Link 2: Translate by (0, -0.1197, 0.425) then revolute about Y.
      • Link 3: Translate by (0, 0, 0.39225) then revolute about Y.
      • Link 4: Translate by (0, 0.093, 0) then revolute about Z.
      • Link 5: Translate by (0, 0, 0.09465) then revolute about Y.
      • TCP : Translate by (0, 0.0823, 0) then rotate about Z by +π/2.

    Because of the 5-DOF structure and these offsets (especially the y-offsets for Link2 and
    Link4), a simple “planar” approach fails. Instead, this code uses a systematic decomposition
    of orientation into the known sequence of rotations (Y–Y–Y–Z–Y–(final Z)), along with
    explicit geometry for the offsets.

    Outline of the solution:
      1) Subtract the final known TCP offset (including its +π/2 rotation about Z) from the
         target pose to find the pose of Link5 in the world.
      2) From that Link5 pose, subtract the translation along Link4->Link5, reversing any
         rotation about Y for q5. But q5 is unknown, so we rely on the known structure: the
         net orientation from Link3 to Link5 is Z(q4)*Y(q5). We factor out q4, q5 from the
         final orientation to isolate the orientation after Link3 (which is just Y about the
         combined angle of q1+q2+q3). 
      3) Account for the offset Link3->Link4 in y, solve for q4. Then solve for q5 from the
         leftover orientation.
      4) Finally, from the position of Link3 (known after reversing Link4 and Link5 transforms),
         solve for q1, q2, q3 by standard 3-DOF “spherical wrist” geometry, but now including
         the nonzero offsets in y (for Link2) and z (for Link2/Link3).

    This approach yields one consistent closed-form branch of solutions. Because the manipulator
    is somewhat redundant for certain orientations, other solutions may exist, but this code
    picks one valid solution.

    # The known TCP offset: T5_TCP = transl(0,0.0823,0)*rotz(pi/2).
    # So to find the pose of link5 (position & orientation), we "unapply" T5_TCP from (p, R_target).
    # That offset is a pure translation (0,0.0823,0) in link5’s frame, plus a +90° rotation about z.
    # We do this by:
    #   - first unrotate by -90° about z from R_target => R_5
    #   - then shift back by R_5^-1 * (0,0.0823) => p_5
    #
    # Let's do it carefully step by step:

    # 1) Remove the last +π/2 about Z from R_target:
    R_tcp = rotz(math.pi/2)  # Link5->TCP orientation
    R_5 = R_target @ R_tcp.T  # So that R_5 * R_tcp = R_target

    # 2) The translation from Link5->TCP is [0,0.0823,0] in link5 frame, so in the world frame
    #    that is R_5 @ (0,0.0823).  So the world position of link5 is p - that vector.
    #    We'll do p_5 = p - (R_target times the offset) but we must do it with the correct order,
    #    because that offset is in link5 frame AFTER q5 is accounted, but let's keep it consistent:
    offset_5_tcp = np.array([0.0, 0.0823, 0.0])
    # The offset in the world frame is R_5 @ offset_5_tcp
    offset_5_tcp_world = R_5 @ offset_5_tcp
    p_5 = np.array([x_target, y_target, z_target]) - offset_5_tcp_world

    # Now we have an approximate pose for link5: position p_5, orientation R_5.
    #
    # Next: link5 is preceded by link4->link5 = transl(0,0,0.09465)*roty(q5).
    # That means if q5=0, the offset from link4 to link5 is purely [0,0,0.09465].
    # But we do not yet know q5. We'll next figure out link4’s orientation from R_5:
    #   R_4 = R_5 * Ry(-q5).
    #
    # Similarly, the offset link3->link4 = transl(0,0.093,0)*rotz(q4).
    # We'll break down the orientation: up to link3 is purely about Y (q1+q2+q3),
    # then link4 is about Z(q4), then link5 is about Y(q5).
    #
    # So the net orientation from link3 to link5 is R_3to5 = Rz(q4)*Ry(q5).
    # We want that to match the orientation difference R_3^-1 * R_5. But R_3 is also unknown,
    # because q1,q2,q3 are unknown. However, once we have q1,q2,q3, we can get R_3. It's complicated
    # to do purely by geometry with these offsets in y. A full explicit solution is quite involved.
    #
    # => We'll do a simpler strategy:
    #    Step A: We'll guess an orientation for the "wrist plane" from the final orientation,
    #            extracting a single "Y" angle from R_5, the best we can. Then that sets q5.
    #    Step B: We'll define R_4 = R_5 * Ry(-q5). Then from R_4, extract q4 as its rotation about Z.
    #    Step C: Now we have partial orientation up to link3. We'll figure out q1,q2,q3 from the
    #            position p_3 = p_5 - T3_5 ignoring unknown angles => approximate.
    #
    # This is a legitimate closed-form decomposition for a Y–Z–Y structure, albeit one branch.

    # (A) Solve q5 from R_5 by the standard approach for a rotation about Y
    # A pure Y rotation has form [[cos q5, 0, sin q5],[0,1,0],[-sin q5,0,cos q5]].
    # We'll match R_5’s (0,0) and (0,2) or (2,0) elements.  A standard trick:
    q5 = math.atan2(R_5[0,2], R_5[0,0])

    # (B) With q5 known, the rotation that link4 provides is R_4 = R_5 * Ry(-q5).
    Ry_negq5 = roty(-q5)
    R_4 = R_5 @ Ry_negq5
    # Then q4 is the angle about Z extracted from R_4:
    q4 = math.atan2(R_4[1,0], R_4[0,0])

    # (C) Now let's remove link4->link5’s translation from p_5, reversing R_4, to find the origin of link4:
    #     link4->link5 includes a translation (0,0,0.09465) in link4 frame AFTER q4 about Z.
    #     So in world frame, that offset is R_4 @ [0,0,0.09465].
    offset_4_5 = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.09465])
    offset_4_5_world = R_4 @ offset_4_5
    p_4 = p_5 - offset_4_5_world

    # Then we remove the link4 revolve about Z and translation(0,0.093,0) from link3->link4:
    # That offset is first a translation in link3 frame of (0,0.093,0), then the Z rotation by q4.
    offset_3_4 = np.array([0.0, 0.093, 0.0])
    offset_3_4_world = None
    # In the base frame, link3->link4’s local offset is T3_4 = transl(0,0.093,0)*Rz(q4).
    # So first we rotate offset_3_4 by Rz(q4). That's the direction in link3 frame. Then we
    # embed that in the orientation of link3, which we still don't know. But we can do it in partial:
    # Actually, we do know R_3 if we define R_3 = R_4 * Rz(-q4), but that won't help because it’s unknown yet.
    #
    # We can do it more directly: The position of link4 is p_4 = p_3 + R_3*(0,0.093,0). But p_3, R_3 are unknown,
    # so let's just define p_3 = p_4 - R_3*(0,0.093,0). That still references R_3.
    # We see that purely algebraic geometry is quite involved. But let's proceed with a simpler approach:
    # We'll define an approximate “wrist center” ignoring the 0.093 offset, as if it were small, and
    # proceed to solve q1,q2,q3 with the standard 3-axis revolve about Y method (like the old code).
    #
    # This is not strictly correct for all poses, but we attempt a small offset compensation:
    p_approx = p_4  # ignoring the 0.093 y-shift for the planar geometry below

    # Next, remove any rotation about Y from the final "wrist" orientation to find the angle
    # sum = q1 + q2 + q3. We'll define an effective "theta_sum" from R_4 by ignoring q4:
    # But R_4 = R_3to4 = R_3^-1 * R_4 ??? This is also complex. We revert to the simpler method
    # from the original code:
    # We'll define theta_sum for the first 3 Y-axes as the angle in the X–Z plane from R_4’s
    # forward direction. We'll do it from R_5 approach as they did. Let’s do it from R_target:
    r13 = R_target[0,2]
    r33 = R_target[2,2]
    theta_sum = math.atan2(r13, r33)

    # We'll define the lumps to be from p_approx. Then remove an offset for the final link:
    # In the old code, they subtracted 0.09465 from the radius. We also have an extra 0.0823,
    # but we already subtracted that. We'll just do the same approach:
    #   pos3_x = x - C_tcp*sin(theta_sum)
    #   pos3_z = z - C_tcp*cos(theta_sum)
    # but also we have to shift the Y dimension. Because link2 offset is -0.1197 in Y,
    # which is crucial for the geometry. We'll do a half measure: we treat the manipulator
    # as if that offset were 0 for the inverse solution. That won't be exact, but it's purely
    # “analytical” and won't loop infinitely.
