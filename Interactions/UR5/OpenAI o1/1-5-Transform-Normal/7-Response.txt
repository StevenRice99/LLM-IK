    """
    Closed-form symbolic IK for a 5-DOF serial robot (all revolute) described in the DETAILS:
       • Joint1: Revolute about Y
       • Joint2: Revolute about Y
       • Joint3: Revolute about Y
       • Joint4: Revolute about Z
       • Joint5: Revolute about Y
       • TCP: additional fixed translation + rotation about Z by +π/2

    Because the robot has only 5 DOFs, we cannot generally impose all 6 constraints of (px,py,pz, roll, pitch, yaw).
    Nevertheless, the problem statement says that every given (position, orientation) is in the reachable subset,
    and the table of "correct joint values" demonstrates there is indeed a solution for each test pose.

    A standard way to handle a 5-DOF arm is to:
      1) Impose the 3 constraints for the TCP position.
      2) Impose 2 independent orientation constraints (e.g. align the TCP's Z- and Y-axes with the desired orientation).
         That lets us solve 5 equations in 5 unknowns. We effectively "skip" matching the remaining axis exactly.
         (In a 6-DOF robot, you could match all 3 orientation axes.)
    
    Here, we do a purely SYMPY-based symbolic approach for an exact solution, but without numeric iteration:
      • We construct the forward-kinematics T0_TCP(q1...q5) symbolically.
      • We construct the target transform T_des from (p, r) in roll-pitch-yaw = Rx(roll)*Ry(pitch)*Rz(yaw).
      • We only match:
         px_expr == px,
         py_expr == py,
         pz_expr == pz,
         (Z-axis from T0_TCP_expr) == (Z-axis of T_des),
         (Y-axis from T0_TCP_expr) == (Y-axis of T_des).
      • Solve for (q1,q2,q3,q4,q5). Pick the first real solution. Wrap/clamp angles into ±2π.

    This avoids iterative numeric solvers (e.g. nsolve) and uses purely symbolic solve. If there are multiple
    valid branches, we select any one. The problem states all targets are reachable, so we do not check feasibility.

    The solution is designed to be a single pass and should be significantly faster (and not time out)
    than attempting to solve a full 6-constraint IK on a 5-DOF arm.

    Returns (q1,q2,q3,q4,q5), each in [-6.2831853, +6.2831853].

Explanation of key points in this final solution:

1) We build the full forward-kinematics T0_TCP(q1..q5) symbolically.  
2) We build T_des from (p, r) via a standard roll-pitch-yaw composition = Txyz(px,py,pz)*RotX(rx)*RotY(ry)*RotZ(rz).  
3) Since the robot has 5 DOFs but a 6-dimensional pose (3 for position, 3 for orientation), we cannot impose all 6 orientation constraints. A common 5-DOF strategy is to match the position plus two of the three orientation axes. Here, we match the entire y- and z-axes from T0_TCP to T_des.  
4) We form the symbolic equations and call sympy.solve (purely symbolic, no numeric iteration). This yields a direct closed-form solution set.  
5) We pick the first solution returned, wrap angles into the range ±π (then clamp to ±2π), ensuring the final result is within ±6.2831853 as required.  
6) This solution should closely reproduce the “correct” joint values for each test, provided the target pose is in the valid 5-DOF workspace, as the problem states.
