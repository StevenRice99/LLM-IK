Below is one acceptable complete solution. In our chain the TCP frame is reached by first “rotating” by joint 1 about Z and then “rotating” by joint 2 about Y after a fixed translation. In fact the TCP position (in base coordinates) may be written as

  p = Rz(θ₁) · ([0, 0.13585, 0] + (Ry(θ₂) · [0, –0.1197, 0.425]))  
    = Rz(θ₁) · ([0.425·sin(θ₂), (0.13585 – 0.1197), 0.425·cos(θ₂)]).

Noting that (0.13585 – 0.1197) = 0.01615, we see that if we call

  A = 0.425·sin(θ₂)  and  B = 0.01615

then the intermediate (or “wrist”) point (the TCP as expressed in the frame of joint 1) is

  w = [A, B, 0.425·cos(θ₂)].

Because the final TCP is p = Rz(θ₁)·w the Z‐component is unaffected so that

  p_z = 0.425·cos(θ₂)  =>  θ₂ = arccos(p_z/0.425).

(To choose the correct “branch” for θ₂ we look at the desired TCP orientation r; since the product Rz(θ₁)·Ry(θ₂) produces a TCP rpy of [0, θ₂, θ₁] the desired pitch r[1] determines the sign of θ₂.)

Moreover, the (x,y) components satisfy

  [p_x, p_y] = Rz(θ₁) · [A, B].

Since rotation by θ₁ adds an angle to the “intrinsic” direction δ = atan2(B, A) of the vector [A, B], the (x,y) target p has polar angle φ = atan2(p_y, p_x) which must equal

  φ = θ₁ + δ  =>  θ₁ = φ – δ.

Thus, one acceptable closed‐form solution is as follows. (Do note that because the two inputs (position and orientation) are assumed consistent the computed joint‐angle values must satisfy r = [0, θ₂, θ₁].)

Explanation:

1. We first compute θ₂ by inverting the z–component: pz = 0.425*cos(θ₂) gives θ₂ = arccos(pz/0.425). Because arccos returns a value in [0, π] but the desired pitch (r[1]) may be negative, we choose θ₂ with the appropriate sign.

2. Next, we note that in the joint‑1 frame the (x,y) “wrist” vector is [0.425*sin(θ₂), 0.01615]. A rotation by θ₁ produces (px,py) so that the polar angle of (px,py), call it φ, satisfies φ = θ₁ + δ (with δ = atan2(0.01615, 0.425*sin(θ₂))). Hence, θ₁ = φ – δ.

3. Since the overall TCP orientation (rpy) is [0, θ₂, θ₁] these computed joint angles are consistent with the target orientation r.

This closed‐form analytical solution meets the requirements for the two‐DOF chain.
