Below is one valid closed‐form solution. Note that because the two‐joint chain has only two degrees of freedom the desired TCP orientation (given as r in [roll, pitch, yaw]) is not independently controllable. (In our solution we assume that any nonzero r will be consistent with the TCP reaching p.) In the kinematic chain the TCP is reached by first translating from the base via the second link’s fixed offset [0, 0.13585, 0] and then applying the transform from the second (Y–axis) revolute joint and the fixed TCP offset [0, –0.1197, 0.425]. With zero joint rotations the forward kinematics yields

  p = Rz(0) · ([0, 0.13585, 0] + Ry(0)·[0, –0.1197, 0.425])
    = [0, 0.13585, 0] + [0, –0.1197, 0.425]
    = [0, 0.01615, 0.425].

A little algebra shows that the overall TCP position (written in base coordinates) is

  pₓ = cosθ₁·(0.425 sinθ₂) – sinθ₁·(0.01615)
   
  p_y = sinθ₁·(0.425 sinθ₂) + cosθ₁·(0.01615)
   
  p_z = 0.425 cosθ₂.

One may therefore solve for joint 2 from the z coordinate via

  θ₂ = acos(p_z/0.425).

Then (ignoring any potential singularity when sinθ₂ = 0) the xy–components obey

  R_z(θ₁)·[0.425 sinθ₂; 0.01615] = [pₓ; p_y].

This means that if we denote
  ψ = atan2(p_y, pₓ)
and also define
  β = atan2(0.01615, 0.425 sinθ₂),
then the base rotation is given by

  θ₁ = ψ – β.

Below is the complete inverse kinematics function that implements this solution:

------------------------------------------------------------
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    
    Although the chain only has 2 joints, the final TCP orientation (given as r =
    [roll, pitch, yaw]) is fully determined by the joint angles. Thus we assume 
    that any provided orientation is consistent with the desired position.
    
    The kinematics chain is as follows:
      - Joint 1 (Revolute about Z) is located at [0, 0, 0].
      - Joint 2 (Revolute about Y) is located at [0, 0.13585, 0] in Joint 1's frame.
      - The TCP is located at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to Joint 2.
      
    In closed form the forward kinematics are:
      pₓ = cos(θ₁)*(0.425 sin(θ₂)) - sin(θ₁)*(0.01615)
      p_y = sin(θ₁)*(0.425 sin(θ₂)) + cos(θ₁)*(0.01615)
      p_z = 0.425 cos(θ₂)
    (Note: 0.01615 = 0.13585 - 0.1197)
    
    We can thus solve:
      θ₂ = acos(p_z / 0.425)
    and, letting
      ψ = atan2(p_y, pₓ)
      β = atan2(0.01615, 0.425 sin(θ₂))
    we have:
      θ₁ = ψ − β
      
    :param p: The target TCP position [x, y, z] in global coordinates.
    :param r: The target TCP orientation [roll, pitch, yaw] in radians (assumed consistent).
    :return: A tuple (θ₁, θ₂) giving the joint angles in radians.
    """
    import math

    # Unpack the target position.
    x, y, z = p
    
    # Solve for joint 2 from the z–component.
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)
    
    # For the xy–plane part the transformed vector (before rotating by theta1)
    # is [A; B] where:
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)  # contribution along (local) x from joint2
    B = 0.01615                 # constant offset (0.13585 - 0.1197)
    
    # The kinematic relation in the xy–plane is:
    #   Rz(theta1) * [A; B] = [x; y]
    # Thus let psi be the angle of [x; y] and beta be the angle of [A; B].
    psi = math.atan2(y, x)
    beta = math.atan2(B, A)
    
    # Then the base rotation is:
    theta1 = psi - beta

    return theta1, theta2
------------------------------------------------------------

For example, when the joints are zero the forward kinematics yield:
  p = [0, 0.01615, 0.425],
and our inverse method returns (0, 0) as expected.

This solution uses only basic math functions and complies with the instructions.
