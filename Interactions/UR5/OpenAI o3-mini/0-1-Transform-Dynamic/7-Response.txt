    """
    Computes the inverse kinematics for a 2 degrees-of-freedom serial manipulator.
    
    Kinematic Chain Details:
      - Revolute 1 rotates about the Z axis and is located at [0, 0, 0].
      - Revolute 2 rotates about the Y axis and is located at [0, 0.13585, 0] (in Revolute 1's frame).
      - The TCP is located at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] relative to Revolute 2.
    
    The forward kinematics of the chain (with zero joint angles) give:
        p = [0, 0.13585, 0] + Ry(θ₂)*[0, -0.1197, 0.425]
        
    In closed-form, the overall TCP position (expressed in base coordinates) is:
        p_x = cos(θ₁) * (0.425 * sin(θ₂)) - sin(θ₁) * (0.01615)
        p_y = sin(θ₁) * (0.425 * sin(θ₂)) + cos(θ₁) * (0.01615)
        p_z = 0.425 * cos(θ₂)
        
    Here, the constant 0.01615 is computed from the link offsets: 0.13585 (position of Revolute 2)
    minus 0.1197 (offset in TCP position) equals 0.01615.

    We solve the inverse kinematics as follows:
      1. Compute θ₂:
           θ₂ = acos(p_z / 0.425)
      2. For the xy–components, let:
           A = 0.425 * sin(θ₂)          (contribution from the length of the TCP offset)
           B = 0.01615                  (constant offset in the xy-plane)
         Then we have:
           [p_x; p_y] = Rz(θ₁) * [A; B]
         To extract θ₁, let:
           ψ = atan2(p_y, p_x)
           β = atan2(B, A)
         so that:
           θ₁ = ψ - β
           
    Note:
      Although the function accepts a target orientation "r", the manipulator only has 2 DOF.
      Thus, "r" is assumed to be consistent with "p" and does not directly affect the joint values.
    
    :param p: The target TCP position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :param r: The target TCP orientation as a tuple (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians.
    :return: A tuple (θ₁, θ₂) representing the joint angles in radians.
