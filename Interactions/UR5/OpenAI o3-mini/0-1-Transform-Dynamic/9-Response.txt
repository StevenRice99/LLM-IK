    """
    Inverse kinematics for a 2-DoF manipulator with:
      - Joint 1: revolute about Z at [0, 0, 0]
      - Joint 2: revolute about Y at [0, 0.13585, 0]
      - TCP offset (in Joint 2 frame): [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
    
    The forward kinematics (position only) work out to:
      p_x = cos(theta1) * (0.425*sin(theta2)) - sin(theta1) * (0.13585 - 0.1197)
      p_y = sin(theta1) * (0.425*sin(theta2)) + cos(theta1) * (0.13585 - 0.1197)
      p_z = 0.425 * cos(theta2)
      
    Since the chain has only 2 DOF the desired TCP orientation is not fully free.
    We make use of the extra information provided in r (its yaw component) to resolve
    the branch ambiguity. In our convention the TCP’s yaw is the orientation about Z
    of the composite rotation Rz(theta1)*Ry(theta2). (Note that when cos(theta2) < 0,
    the yaw effectively shifts by pi.)
    
    The method is as follows:
      1. From p_z = 0.425*cos(theta2) we get cos(theta2)=p_z/0.425.
         Two possible solutions exist: theta2 = +acos(p_z/0.425) or theta2 = -acos(p_z/0.425).
      2. In the xy‐plane the position satisfies:
             [p_x, p_y] = Rz(theta1) * [0.425*sin(theta2); (0.13585 - 0.1197)]
         so that
             theta1 = atan2(p_y, p_x) – atan2(0.01615, 0.425*sin(theta2))
         where 0.01615 = 0.13585 – 0.1197.
      3. We then obtain two candidate solutions:
             Candidate 1: (theta1₁, theta2₁) with theta2₁ = acos(p_z/0.425)
             Candidate 2: (theta1₂, theta2₂) with theta2₂ = -acos(p_z/0.425)
      4. Although both solutions yield the same TCP position, they lead to different
         TCP orientations. In our manipulator the TCP’s yaw (extracted from R = Rz(theta1)*Ry(theta2))
         will equal theta1 when cos(theta2) >= 0 but (theta1 + pi) when cos(theta2) < 0.
      5. We compute the candidate yaw for each solution and then pick the candidate 
         whose yaw is nearest (modulo 2pi) to the target yaw from r (i.e. r[2]).
    
    :param p: Target TCP position as (x, y, z).
    :param r: Target TCP orientation (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians. Although the orientation
              is not independently controllable, we use its yaw component r[2] to resolve branch ambiguity.
    :return: A tuple (theta1, theta2) with the joint angles in radians.

Explanation:
1. We first obtain two possible solutions for joint 2 from p_z = 0.425*cos(theta2).  
2. For each theta2 candidate, we compute theta1 from the xy–equations.  
3. We then “extract” the TCP yaw from the rotation Rz(theta1)*Ry(theta2) (noting the π–shift when cos(theta2) < 0) and compare it with the given target yaw r[2].  
4. The candidate pair whose computed yaw is closest (modulo 2π) to r[2] is returned.

This closed–form solution (using Python’s math module) meets the requirements and—when tested on the provided targets—produces joint values matching the feedback.
