Below is one valid closed‐form solution. In our chain the TCP position p is given by

  pₓ = cos(q₁)·(L·sin(q₂)) – sin(q₁)·δ  
  pᵧ = sin(q₁)·(L·sin(q₂)) + cos(q₁)·δ  
  p_z = L·cos(q₂)

where L = 0.425 (the “length” from joint 2 to TCP) and δ = 0.01615 (the effective offset arising from the chain, note 0.13585 – 0.1197 = 0.01615). In words, the offset from the second link’s frame is [L*sin(q₂), δ] in the XY–plane and L·cos(q₂) in Z. One may solve these equations in closed form by first inverting the Z equation

  q₂ = acos(p_z/L)

(which is valid since all targets are assumed reachable) and then noticing that the first two equations can be written as

  [pₓ; pᵧ] = Rz(q₁) · [L·sin(q₂); δ].

That is, the vector [L·sin(q₂); δ] is rotated by q₁ to yield [pₓ; pᵧ]. Hence its original direction (call it φ) is

  φ = atan2(δ, L·sin(q₂))        (1)

and the target’s polar angle is

  ψ = atan2(pᵧ, pₓ).         (2)

Thus, the solution for joint 1 is

  q₁ = ψ − φ.

Below is the complete Python function implementing this solution. (Note that although the function signature includes an orientation r, the 2–DOF manipulator only has enough freedom to control TCP position; the desired orientation is assumed compatible with the chain.)

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. We compute q₂ from the TCP’s z–coordinate.
2. The x–y position of the TCP equals the fixed vector [L*sin(q₂); offset] rotated by q₁. Thus, we take the difference between the target vector’s angle and the fixed vector’s angle to find q₁.
3. The orientation input r is not used here because our 2–DOF chain only controls the TCP’s position.

This closed–form solution satisfies the given forward kinematics, as verified by the sample forward kinematics output when q₁ = 0 and q₂ = 0 (yielding TCP position [0, 0.01615, 0.425]).
