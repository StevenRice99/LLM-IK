    """
    Calculates the joint angles (theta1, theta2) for a 2-DOF serial manipulator to achieve the
    provided TCP position and orientation. This solution is based on the forward kinematics defined as:
    
        TCP_position = Rz(theta1) * ([0.425*sin(theta2), (0.13585 - 0.1197), 0.425*cos(theta2)])
        
    where:
        - The z-component gives: p_z = 0.425*cos(theta2)   =>   theta2 = acos(p_z / 0.425)
        - The effective xy-components are given by:
              A = 0.425*sin(theta2)
              B = 0.13585 - 0.1197  (≈ 0.01615)
          and since the rotated link vector [A, B] is transformed by rotation theta1:
              [p_x, p_y] = Rz(theta1) * [A, B]
          we have:
              theta1 = atan2(p_y, p_x) - atan2(B, A)
              
    Additionally, the chain imparts an orientation such that the TCP's roll, pitch, yaw are:
          [0, theta2, theta1]
    and the provided "r" input is assumed to be consistent with this.
    
    :param p: The target TCP position as a tuple (x, y, z).
    :param r: The target TCP orientation as a tuple (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians.
    :return: A tuple (theta1, theta2) representing the required joint angles.

    # Unpack the target position.
    x, y, z = p

    # Calculate theta2 from the z-component based on p_z = 0.425*cos(theta2)
    theta2 = math.acos(z / 0.425)

    # Compute the effective components in the xy plane.
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)   # contribution along the x-direction in the local second-link frame
