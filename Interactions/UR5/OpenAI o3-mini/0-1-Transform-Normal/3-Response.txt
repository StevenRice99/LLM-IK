Below is one acceptable closed‐form solution. In our solution we “decouple” the problem by noting that (with the given fixed link offsets) the TCP position is computed as

  p = Rz(θ₁) · ([0.425·sin(θ₂), 0.13585–0.1197, 0.425·cos(θ₂)]ᵀ)

so that the z‐coordinate gives

  0.425·cos(θ₂) = p_z ⟹ θ₂ = ±acos(p_z/0.425).

To select the proper branch we use the desired TCP “pitch” (the y–component from the rpy input, r[1]) to choose the sign (i.e. if r[1] is negative we take the negative solution, otherwise positive). Then the projection onto the xy–plane is

  [p_x, p_y]ᵀ = Rz(θ₁) · [0.425·sin(θ₂), 0.13585–0.1197]ᵀ.

In other words, if we denote
  A = 0.425·sin(θ₂) and B = 0.13585–0.1197 (which equals 0.01615),
then one may solve for θ₁ as

  θ₁ = atan2(p_y, p_x) – atan2(B, A).

A complete solution is as follows:

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    p = [x, y, z] is the desired TCP position.
    r = [roll, pitch, yaw] (in radians) is the desired orientation.
    The robot has two revolute joints:
      - Joint 1 rotates about Z.
      - Joint 2 rotates about Y.
    The forward kinematics are:
      1) The first joint is at [0,0,0] with rotation Rz(θ₁).
      2) The second joint is translated by [0, 0.13585, 0] (in the base frame)
         and rotates about Y by θ₂.
      3) The TCP (tool) is offset by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] from Joint2.
    This gives the closed form position:
        p = Rz(θ₁) * ( [0.425·sin(θ₂),
                        (0.13585-0.1197),
                        0.425·cos(θ₂)] )
    and the TCP’s rpy (when extracted in ZYX order) becomes [0, θ₂, θ₁].
    
    Given a target (p, r) we first compute θ₂ from the z–component of p.
    (Because cos(θ₂) = p_z / 0.425 there are two solutions; we select the one
     whose sign is consistent with the desired pitch r[1].)
    Then we compute θ₁ by comparing the angle of the provided [p_x, p_y]
    with the angle of the vector [0.425·sin(θ₂), 0.13585–0.1197].

Explanation:

1. We first “solve” the z–equation p_z = 0.425*cos(θ₂). Since cosine is even there are two solutions. We pick the one whose sign (positive or negative) is consistent with the provided pitch (r[1]).

2. Then, noting that the effective displacement in the xy–plane is given by [0.425·sin(θ₂), 0.01615] (with 0.01615 coming from 0.13585–0.1197) and that applying a rotation by θ₁ yields the desired [p_x, p_y], we solve for θ₁ by subtracting the “offset angle” of the vector [0.425·sin(θ₂), 0.01615] from the angle of the desired position in the xy–plane.

This solution returns the joint angles (in radians) that achieve the target TCP position p and orientation r (which, when expressed as roll–pitch–yaw, are [0, θ₂, θ₁]).
