Below is one acceptable closed‐form solution. In our setup the forward kinematics gives

  TCP position = [0.425·sin(θ₂)·cos(θ₁) – 0.01615·sin(θ₁),
             0.425·sin(θ₂)·sin(θ₁) + 0.01615·cos(θ₁),
             0.425·cos(θ₂)]

and TCP orientation (expressed in “roll–pitch–yaw”) as [0, θ₂, θ₁]. In other words the end‐effector can only have zero roll while the pitch and yaw are exactly the second and first joint angles, respectively.

Thus when a target pose is given as
  p = [x, y, z] and r = [0, pitch, yaw],
the inverse solution is obtained by “choosing” the branch consistent with the orientation. That is, one sets

  θ₂ = r[1]           (provided that 0.425·cos(θ₂) = z)
  θ₁ = [computed from the x–y equations, which can be written as]
    x = 0.425·sin(θ₂)·cos(θ₁) – 0.01615·sin(θ₁)
    y = 0.425·sin(θ₂)·sin(θ₁) + 0.01615·cos(θ₁)

One may show that (using a complex–number trick)
  pₓ + i pᵧ = (A + iB)·exp(i·θ₁)
with A = 0.425·sin(r[1]) and B = 0.01615, so that
  θ₁ = atan2(pᵧ, pₓ) – atan2(B, A).

Since the forward kinematics tells us that the TCP’s yaw equals joint 1 (θ₁) and its pitch equals joint 2 (θ₂), target orientation “r” selects the correct IK branch. (Any small discrepancy – for example, due to roundoff – may be attributed to numerical error. We assume that targets are reachable so that p and r are consistent.)

One acceptable implementation is therefore:

------------------------------------------------
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], 
                       r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach the desired TCP pose.
    The manipulator consists of two revolute joints. The TCP pose
    is obtained by first rotating about Z (joint1) and then about Y (joint2),
    and then applying a fixed translation. In particular the forward kinematics are:
    
      TCP position = [ 0.425*sin(theta2)*cos(theta1) - 0.01615*sin(theta1),
                       0.425*sin(theta2)*sin(theta1) + 0.01615*cos(theta1),
                       0.425*cos(theta2) ]
                       
      TCP orientation (rpy) = [ 0, theta2, theta1 ]
    
    Since the incoming target orientation r = [roll, pitch, yaw] 
    must satisfy roll = 0, we have theta2 = pitch and theta1 = yaw.
    To be consistent with the TCP position, the equations
      z = 0.425*cos(theta2)
      pₓ + i pᵧ = (0.425*sin(theta2) + i*0.01615) exp(i theta1)
    must hold.
    
    This method uses the pitch from r (theta2 = r[1]) to choose the correct
    solution branch and then computes theta1 from the x–y equations.
    
    :param p: The target position [x, y, z].
    :param r: The target orientation in rpy [roll, pitch, yaw]. (roll must be 0)
    :return: A tuple (theta1, theta2) in radians to be set for the two joints.
    """
    import math
    # Unpack target position.
    x, y, z = p
    # Use desired pitch from target orientation as joint 2.
    theta2 = r[1]
    # (Optionally, one could verify that z == 0.425*cos(theta2) within tolerance.)
    
    # Compute the coefficients in the x-y plane.
    A = 0.425 * math.sin(theta2)
    B = 0.01615   # This is the effective offset from the second joint in the x-y plane.
    
    # The x and y equations can be combined into:
    #   p_x + i*p_y = (A + i*B)*exp(i*theta1)
    # So we extract theta1 as:
    theta1 = math.atan2(y, x) - math.atan2(B, A)
    
    return (theta1, theta2)
------------------------------------------------

In the above solution the desired orientation r = [0, θ₂, θ₁] directly selects the branch of solutions (note that with two joints the TCP cannot have an arbitrary roll). For example, if one calls

  inverse_kinematics([0.13627, 0.26833, 0.30052], [0, 0.7853981633974483, 1.0471975511965976])

the returned joint values will be approximately (1.0472, 0.7854) radians, which are consistent with the earlier forward kinematics test.
