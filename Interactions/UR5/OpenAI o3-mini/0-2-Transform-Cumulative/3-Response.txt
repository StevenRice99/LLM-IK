Below is one acceptable complete solution. In this solution the idea is to first “undo” the rotation about Z (joint 1) so that the remaining two joints work in a planar (x–z) sub‐chain. (Note that the joint2 “shoulder” is offset in y by 0.13585 in the base so we subtract that after the rotation.) Then we use the desired TCP orientation (given as rpy) to compute the “sum angle” (θ₂ + θ₃) that the remaining two joints must achieve. Finally, using the standard two‐link law-of-cosines formulation with link lengths a = 0.425 (from joint2 to joint3) and b = 0.39225 (from joint3 to TCP) we solve for the two joint angles. One acceptable implementation is as follows:

--------------------------------------------------

Explanation of key steps:
1. The first joint is solved by “canceling” the horizontal (x–y plane) error via theta1 = atan2(–x, y).
2. The target position is rotated (by –θ₁) and the fixed translation to joint2 ([0, 0.13585, 0]) is removed.
3. The remaining error lies in the x–z plane and the law‐of‐cosines is used with link lengths (a = 0.425, b = 0.39225) under the constraint that (θ₂ + θ₃) must equal theta_sum (extracted from the desired rpy orientation).
4. Finally, the method returns the three joint angles.

This solution meets the instructions; note that alternate valid formulations exist.
