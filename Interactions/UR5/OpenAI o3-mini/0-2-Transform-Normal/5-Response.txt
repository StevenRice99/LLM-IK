Below is one acceptable closed‚Äêform solution. In our derivation we first note that with the given convention the forward kinematics can be written as

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉT = Rz(q‚ÇÅ) ¬∑ [T(0,0.13585,0) ¬∑ Ry(q‚ÇÇ)] ¬∑ [T(0,‚Äì0.1197,0.425) ¬∑ Ry(q‚ÇÉ)] ¬∑ T(0,0,0.39225).

A short derivation shows that the TCP‚Äôs orientation becomes

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉR_tcp = Rz(q‚ÇÅ) ¬∑ Ry(q‚ÇÇ + q‚ÇÉ),

so that when the TCP ‚Äúrpy‚Äù is given as (roll, pitch, yaw) the only way to match is to set

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉq‚ÇÅ = yaw‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉand‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉq‚ÇÇ + q‚ÇÉ = pitch.

A second observation is that the fixed translations (note that a rotation about Y does not change the ‚Äúy‚Äù‚Äêcomponent) yield a constant offset in the ‚Äúy‚Äù direction, namely  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉd_y = 0.13585 + (‚Äì0.1197) = 0.01615.

It turns out that after ‚Äúremoving‚Äù the base rotation Rz(q‚ÇÅ) by computing p‚Ä≤ = Rz(‚Äìq‚ÇÅ)*p the x‚Äìz part of the position is given by

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉp‚Ä≤‚Çì = 0.425¬∑sin(q‚ÇÇ) + 0.39225¬∑sin(pitch),
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉp‚Ä≤ùóì = 0.425¬∑cos(q‚ÇÇ) + 0.39225¬∑cos(pitch).

Subtracting the TCP offset contribution leaves
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ0.425¬∑sin(q‚ÇÇ) = p‚Ä≤‚Çì ‚Äì 0.39225¬∑sin(pitch),
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ0.425¬∑cos(q‚ÇÇ) = p‚Ä≤ùóì ‚Äì 0.39225¬∑cos(pitch),
so that one may solve

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉq‚ÇÇ = atan2(p‚Ä≤‚Çì ‚Äì 0.39225¬∑sin(pitch),
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉp‚Ä≤ùóì ‚Äì 0.39225¬∑cos(pitch))
and then
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉq‚ÇÉ = pitch ‚Äì q‚ÇÇ.

The complete inverse kinematics function is therefore:

--------------------------------------------------
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    Here p = (x, y, z) and r = (roll, pitch, yaw). Given the robot structure, the TCP‚Äôs
    orientation is R_tcp = Rz(q1) * Ry(q2+q3), so we set:
         q1 = yaw     and     q2+q3 = pitch.
    The position kinematics (after ‚Äúremoving‚Äù Rz(q1)) reduce to:
         0.425*sin(q2) = p'_x - 0.39225*sin(pitch)
         0.425*cos(q2) = p'_z - 0.39225*cos(pitch)
    where p' = Rz(-q1) * p.
    :param p: The position to reach in the form (x, y, z).
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form (roll, pitch, yaw).
    :return: A tuple (q1, q2, q3) of the joint angles in radians.
    """
    import math

    # Set joint 1 from the desired yaw.
    q1 = r[2]
    pitch = r[1]   # q2 + q3

    # Remove the base rotation: p' = Rz(-q1) * p.
    c1 = math.cos(q1)
    s1 = math.sin(q1)
    p_prime_x = c1 * p[0] + s1 * p[1]
    # p_prime_y should equal the constant offset 0.13585 - 0.1197 = 0.01615.
    p_prime_y = -s1 * p[0] + c1 * p[1]
    p_prime_z = p[2]

    # Given the TCP offset along the z direction in the final joint‚Äôs frame.
    tcp_offset = 0.39225
    # Solve for q2 using the xz projection (the effective vector from joint 2).
    num = p_prime_x - tcp_offset * math.sin(pitch)
    den = p_prime_z - tcp_offset * math.cos(pitch)
    q2 = math.atan2(num, den)

    # And set q3 so that the sum equals the desired pitch.
    q3 = pitch - q2

    return (q1, q2, q3)
--------------------------------------------------

This implementation first ‚Äúundoes‚Äù the base rotation (using q1 = yaw) so that the effective x‚Äìz coordinates can be used to solve for q2; then q3 follows from the required sum q2 + q3 = pitch. (Note that the constant y offset does not affect q2 or q3.) 

Any target p and r (with r[0] = roll = 0) that satisfy the robot‚Äôs structure will be reached by these joint angles.
