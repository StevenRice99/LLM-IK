Below is one acceptable solution. In our solution we first “decouple” the base yaw by choosing θ₁ so that when we rotate the target position by –θ₁ the remainder falls in the “arm‐plane” (the plane in which the two “arm” links lie). In our case the first joint rotates about Z and we choose

  θ₁ = atan2(–pₓ, p_y)

so that after forming p′ = Rz(–θ₁)·p the first (x) component is (nearly) zero. (In forward kinematics with all other joints zero the TCP lies at [0,0.10915,0.81725] in the rotated frame.) Then noting that the remaining two “arm” joints effect a 2‑R planar chain in the (x,z)–plane, we set

  X_target = p′ₓ  and  Z_target = p′_z

with link lengths L₁=0.425 and L₂=0.39225. (Notice that the constant offsets in y add to 0.13585 + (–0.1197) + 0.093 = 0.10915.) Then by the law‐of‐cosines we write

  cos(θ₃) = (r² – L₁² – L₂²)/(2 L₁ L₂)  with r = sqrt(X_target²+Z_target²)

and choose, for example, the “elbow‐down” solution θ₃ = acos(…). Next, using

  θ₂ = atan2(X_target, Z_target) – atan2(L₂ sin(θ₃), L₁+L₂ cos(θ₃))

we have solved the position for joints 2–3. Finally, note that since joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate about Y the overall “arm–orientation” in the decoupled chain is given by

  θ_total = θ₂+θ₃+θ₄.

We now compute the desired end‐effector orientation from the given roll–pitch–yaw (with the convention R = Rz(yaw)*Ry(pitch)*Rx(roll)). In order for the 4DOF to be consistent the target orientation must be achievable as Rz(θ₁)*Ry(θ_total). Thus we “remove” the already–solved base rotation by forming

  R′ = Rz(–θ₁)*R_desired

and then identify

  θ_total = atan2(R′[0,2], R′[0,0]).

Then we set

  θ₄ = θ_total – (θ₂+θ₃).

The complete function is shown below.

Comments:

• The key idea is to choose θ₁ so that the target position “drops” into the plane where the remaining arm (joints 2–4) operate.
• The two “arm” links (with lengths 0.425 and 0.39225) then form a standard 2-R chain in the (x,z)–plane (after decoupling) and are solved via the law–of–cosines.
• Finally, the overall orientation R_tcp = Rz(θ₁)*Ry(θ₂+θ₃+θ₄) must match the target R_desired. After “removing” the base rotation by Rz(–θ₁), we extract the needed accumulated Y–rotation and set θ₄ accordingly.

This closed–form solution satisfies the problem statement.
