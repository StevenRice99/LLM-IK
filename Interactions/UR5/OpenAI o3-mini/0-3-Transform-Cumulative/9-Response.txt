    """
    Closed‐form inverse kinematics for a 4‐DOF manipulator with:
      - Joint 1: Revolute about Z at [0,0,0]
      - Joint 2: Revolute about Y with translation [0, 0.13585, 0]
      - Joint 3: Revolute about Y with translation [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
      - Joint 4: Revolute about Y with translation [0, 0, 0.39225]
      - TCP offset: [0, 0.093, 0]
    
    Note: Because joints 2–4 rotate about Y and their y–translations sum to
         0.13585 – 0.1197 + 0.093 = 0.10915,
         the TCP’s y–coordinate is fixed at 0.10915 regardless of the arm‐angles.
    
    The IK is decoupled by “removing” the base rotation.
    In particular, if p = (x,y,z) is the target in the world frame and we let
         constant_offset = 0.10915,
    then the base rotation theta1 must satisfy:
         -sin(theta1)*x + cos(theta1)*y = constant_offset.
    Writing this in the form
         cos(theta1 + φ) = constant_offset/√(x²+y²),
    with φ = atan2(x, y), the two algebraic solutions are:
         theta1 = –φ ± arccos(constant_offset/√(x² + y²)).
    Experience with this manipulator indicates that for a given target one branch
    will yield a solution that is consistent with the later positional and orientational
    requirements. We then solve the 2‐R planar chain (with effective link lengths L₁ and L₂)
    in the rotated frame. In that frame (defined by rotating the target by –theta1),
    the x– and z–coordinates satisfy:
         X_target = L₁·sin(theta2) + L₂·sin(theta2+theta3),
         Z_target = L₁·cos(theta2) + L₂·cos(theta2+theta3).
    Finally, since joints 2–4 (all about Y) yield a cumulative rotation
         theta_arm = theta2 + theta3 + theta4,
    we “remove” the base rotation from the desired end–effector orientation (given as roll–pitch–yaw)
    to extract the desired arm rotation. That is, forming
         R' = Rz(–theta1)·R_desired,
    where R_desired = Rz(yaw)*Ry(pitch)*Rx(roll), we set
         theta_total = atan2(R'[0,2], R'[0,0])
    and then
         theta4 = theta_total – (theta2 + theta3).
    
    Because of the dual ambiguities in the solutions for theta1 and theta3, we generate all candidates,
    compute forward kinematics for each, and return the set with minimum position error.
