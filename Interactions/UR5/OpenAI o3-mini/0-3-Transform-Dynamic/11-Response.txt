    Computes an analytical inverse kinematics solution for a 4-DOF serial manipulator.

    The robot parameters (all units in meters and angles in radians) are as follows:
      • Joint 1 (Base): Located at [0, 0, 0], rotates about Z.
      • Joint 2 (Shoulder): Its origin is at [0, 0.13585, 0] in the base frame;
          its orientation (from the URDF) is zero so that its local frame aligns with the base.
      • Joint 3 (Elbow): Relative to joint2, its origin is at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] and rotates about Y.
      • Joint 4 (Wrist): Relative to joint3, its origin is at [0, 0, 0.39225] and rotates about Y.
      • TCP: Relative to joint4, there is a constant translation [0, 0.093, 0].

    Notice that joints 2, 3, and 4 all rotate about Y. Hence, the forward kinematics
    for the “arm” (i.e. the x–z placement) can be decoupled from the overall orientation.
    In particular, if we define the transformation chain as (using homogeneous transforms):
         T = Rz(theta1) * T2 * [2R-chain path],
    then the TCP position will be given by
         p = Rz(theta1) * p_chain + (joint2 position),
    where the “chain” runs in the joint2 (shoulder) coordinate frame.
    
    In the shoulder frame (i.e. joint2 frame) the constant translations are:
         • The translation from base to joint2: T2 = [0, 0.13585, 0] in the base.
           In the joint2 frame the shoulder’s origin is at (0,0,0) by definition.
         • The translation from joint2 to joint3 is [0, -0.1197, 0.425]. 
         • The translation from joint3 to joint4 is [0, 0, 0.39225].
         • The TCP offset (in joint4 frame) is [0, 0.093, 0].
    Thus, note that in the entire chain the only translation that affects the plane of
    motion (i.e. the x–z coordinates) comes from the “z” parts:
         L1 = 0.425      (effect from joint2->joint3)
         L2 = 0.39225    (effect from joint3->joint4)
    Meanwhile, the y components always add up to a constant:
         y_chain = (-0.1197 + 0.093) = -0.0267.
    And after transforming back to base, the shoulder (joint2) “origin” is located at
         p_joint2_base = Rz(theta1)*[0, 0.13585, 0],
    so that the final TCP y-coordinate comes out as
         0.13585 + (-0.0267) = 0.10915,
    independent of the arm “stretch”. (The targets will be such that p[1] is accordingly set.)

    For the orientation, note that the full rotation is
         R = Rz(theta1) * Ry(theta2 + theta3 + theta4)
    and the provided tool‐chain uses roll–pitch–yaw with r = [roll, pitch, yaw].
    In many tests the roll is essentially zero and the desired 
         theta1 ≈ (one of) { yaw, yaw + π, yaw – π } 
    and the “arm rotation” fulfills
         theta2 + theta3 + theta4 = r_pitch.
    We adopt this decoupling: after selecting a candidate theta1, we solve the 2–R inverse
    kinematics for the arm “plan” (in the joint2 frame) and then set theta4 = r_pitch – (theta2+theta3).

    Procedure:
      1. Generate candidate values for theta1 from the desired yaw (r[2]):
             candidates = { wrap(yaw), wrap(yaw+π), wrap(yaw−π) }.
      2. For each candidate theta1:
           a. Compute the shoulder (joint2) position in base:
                  p_j2 = Rz(theta1)*[0, 0.13585, 0].
           b. Express the target TCP position in the joint2 frame:
                  p_joint2 = Rz(–theta1) * ( p – p_j2 )
           c. In the joint2 frame, the 2–R planar chain (which governs the x and z coordinates)
              must reconstruct:
                  [ x_chain, –0.0267, z_chain ] = [ L1*sin(theta2)+L2*sin(theta2+theta3),
                                                   –0.0267,
                                                   L1*cos(theta2)+L2*cos(theta2+theta3) ]
              We set:
                   x_target = p_joint2[0]   and   z_target = p_joint2[2]
           d. Solve the 2–R inverse kinematics:
                   d = sqrt(x_target^2 + z_target^2)
                   cos(theta3) = (d^2 – L1^2 – L2^2) / (2*L1*L2)
                   (Choose theta3 = acos(cos(theta3)) and also consider the negative solution.)
                   theta2 = atan2(x_target, z_target) – atan2(L2*sin(theta3), L1+L2*cos(theta3))
           e. Determine theta4 from the orientation constraint:
                   theta4 = r_pitch – (theta2 + theta3)   where r_pitch = r[1].
           f. Compute an error that measures how well the computed planar chain reconstructs
              the (x, z) target and how close the computed joint2 y (which is fixed by the chain)
              is to –0.0267.
      3. Choose the solution (over candidate theta1 and the two signs for theta3) that minimizes the error.
