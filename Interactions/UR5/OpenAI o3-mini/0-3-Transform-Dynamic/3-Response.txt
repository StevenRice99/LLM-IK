Below is one acceptable closed‐form solution. In our approach we first “undo” the base rotation (joint 1) by computing

  q₁ = atan2(–pₓ, p_y)

so that the remaining “wrist” position can be computed from the TCP position (after subtracting the fixed tool offset) and expressed in the coordinate frame of joint 2. (Recall that joint 2’s origin in the base is given by a fixed translation of [0, 0.13585, 0] rotated by q₁.) Then we “project” the wrist center into the x–z plane of joint 2 (the axis of rotation for joints 2–4 is Y) and solve the two‐link problem using the link “lengths” L₁ = 0.425 (from joint 2 to joint 3) and L₂ = 0.39225 (from joint 3 to joint 4). Finally, we choose q₄ so that the sum q₂ + q₃ + q₄ equals the desired “wrist” orientation (which here is obtained from the TCP rpy via  
  target_sum = atan2(R[0,2],R[0,0])). 

One acceptable implementation is as follows (note that there are two “elbow–up” vs “elbow–down” solutions; here we pick one branch by taking q₃ = –acos(…)):

    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach TCP position "p" and orientation "r".
    The robot has 4 DOF with:
      • Joint 1 (Revolute about Z) computed from the projection of p.
      • Joints 2–4 (revolute about Y) forming a planar chain once joint 1 is “undone.”
    The fixed transforms (from the URDF) are:
      • T₂ translation: [0, 0.13585, 0]
      • T₃ translation: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
      • T₄ translation: [0, 0, 0.39225]
      • TCP offset: [0, 0.093, 0]
    For the planar chain we use effective link lengths
      L₁ = 0.425    (from joint 2 to joint 3)
      L₂ = 0.39225  (from joint 3 to joint 4)
    One can show that the closed‐form inverse kinematics is then given by:
    
      q₁ = atan2(–pₓ, p_y)
      
      Let R_tcp be the homogeneous rotation from the desired rpy:
         (roll, pitch, yaw) = r,
         and for our convention:
              R_tcp = [[cy*cp, –sy,        cy*sp],
                       [sy*cp,  cy,         sy*sp],
                       [ –sp,    0,         cp   ]]
         with cr = cos(roll), sr = sin(roll),
              cp = cos(pitch), sp = sin(pitch),
              cy = cos(yaw), sy = sin(yaw).
              
      Compute the TCP’s wrist center (joint 4’s origin) by removing the TCP offset:
         p_wrist = p – R_tcp*[0, 0.093, 0]
      
      Next, the origin of joint 2 (in the base) is
         p₂ = T₁(q₁)*[0, 0.13585, 0]
      so the vector from joint 2 to the wrist center is:
         p_diff = p_wrist – p₂.
      
      Undo q₁ by rotating this difference about Z by –q₁:
         p_eff = Rz(–q₁)*p_diff.
      (Because joint 2’s rotations occur about Y the planar chain “lives” in the x–z plane.)
      
      Let x_target = (p_eff)_x and z_target = (p_eff)_z.
      Then the “distance” to reach is d = sqrt(x_target² + z_target²) and the shoulder angle
         φ = atan2(x_target, z_target).
      
      The cosine law on the two-link (L₁, L₂) arm gives:
         cos(q₃_candidate) = (d² – L₁² – L₂²) / (2 L₁ L₂)
      and we choose:
         q₃ = –acos(cos(q₃_candidate))   (one choice of branch)
      
      Also define:
         δ = atan2(L₂ sin(acos(…)), L₁ + L₂ cos(acos(…))).
      Then set:
         q₂ = φ – δ.
      
      Finally, the orientation requirement for the remaining joints is that:
         q₂ + q₃ + q₄ = target_sum, where target_sum = atan2(R_tcp[0,2], R_tcp[0,0]).
      So,
         q₄ = target_sum – (q₂ + q₃).

Explanation:

1. We first compute q₁ = atan2(–pₓ, p_y) (as in EXISTING 1).

2. We form the TCP rotation matrix R_tcp from the given rpy (using the same “roll–pitch–yaw” convention as in EXISTING 2) and subtract the fixed TCP offset [0, 0.093, 0] to find the wrist center p_wrist.

3. Next, we compute joint 2’s origin (by applying a rotation about Z by q₁ to [0, 0.13585, 0]) and then express the vector from joint 2 to the wrist center in joint 2’s “planar” (x–z) frame by rotating with Rz(–q₁).

4. The standard 2R law (using L₁ and L₂) is applied to solve for q₂ and q₃. (There is an alternate solution corresponding to the sign of acos; here we choose the branch with q₃ = –acos(…)).

5. Finally, we fix q₄ so that (q₂ + q₃ + q₄) equals the desired “target_sum” extracted from R_tcp.

This is one acceptable closed–form analytical inverse kinematics solution for the 4–DOF robot.
