    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r" for the 4-DOF serial manipulator.

    Kinematic chain:
      - Joint 1 rotates about Z.
      - Joint 2 is offset by [0, 0.13585, 0] (in link1 frame) and rotates about Y.
      - Joint 3 is located at [0, -0.1197, 0.425] (in link2 frame) and rotates about Y.
      - Joint 4 is located at [0, 0, 0.39225] (in link3 frame) and rotates about Y.
      - The TCP is offset by [0, 0.093, 0] (in link4 frame).
      
    For IK, we exploit the fact that (apart from the base rotation) the remaining motion
    happens in a plane (using the z–components of the translations) so that the two “planar links”
      L1 = 0.425   (from joint2-to-joint3)
      L2 = 0.39225 (from joint3-to-joint4)
    govern the x–z positioning in the joint2 frame.
    
    This function first extracts a desired rotation matrix R_desired from the input r (roll, pitch, yaw)
    using the same convention as in the EXISTING code. Then, by noting that the full end‐effector
    orientation is a product R = Rz(theta1)*Ry(ψ) (with ψ = θ2+θ3+θ4), we choose the base angle (joint1)
    so that, when we “remove” the Rz(theta1) rotation from R_desired, the remainder R_planar = Rz(–theta1)*R_desired
    is a pure rotation about Y (i.e. its (0,0) and (0,2) elements define an angle ψ). Next, the TCP position p
    is “shifted” into joint2’s coordinate system. (Because the joint2 frame is translated by T2 = Rz(theta1)*[0,0.13585,0],
    one finds that the effective planar target coordinates become:
            x_eff = p_x*cos(theta1) + p_y*sin(theta1)
            z_eff = p_z   )
    The two-link planar IK (using the cosine law) is then used to solve for joints 2 and 3; finally joint 4 is
    obtained so that the sum (θ2+θ3+θ4) matches the planar target sum.
    
    Any candidate solution is acceptable.

    :param r: The desired TCP orientation as (roll, pitch, yaw) in radians.
