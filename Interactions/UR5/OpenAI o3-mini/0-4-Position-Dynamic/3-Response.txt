Below is one acceptable closed‐form solution. In our approach we note that only three “effective” joints actually affect the TCP position. In fact, by writing the full forward kinematics one may show that

  TCP position = p₃ + [0.09465·sin(θ₄), 0.093, 0.39225 + 0.09465·cos(θ₄)]   (1)

with

  p₃ = [0.425·sin(θ₂)·cos(θ₁) – 0.01615·sin(θ₁),
      0.425·sin(θ₂)·sin(θ₁) + 0.01615·cos(θ₁),
      0.425·cos(θ₂)]        (2)

Since the five‐DOF arm only must “reach” a 3D point the extra two joints (θ₃ and one “wrist” variable) may be set arbitrarily. One acceptable answer is to set θ₃ = 0 and “absorb” the remaining wrist motion into choosing θ₄ (and, say, θ₅ = 0). (Any solution that yields p when the homogeneous transforms are applied is acceptable.) 

One way to derive a closed‐form solution is to “split” (1)–(2) into two sub‐chain problems. First, note that (1) may be “inverted” for θ₄ by writing
  [x – 0.09465·sin(θ₄)]² + (y – 0.093)² + [z – 0.39225 – 0.09465·cos(θ₄)]²
    = (0.425² + 0.01615²).
One may then rewrite this as

  x·sin(θ₄) + (z–0.39225)·cos(θ₄) = K   (3)

with
  K = [x² + (y–0.093)² + (z–0.39225)² + 0.09465² – (0.425²+0.01615²)]⁄(2·0.09465).

Defining R = √[x² + (z–0.39225)²] and φ = atan2(x, z–0.39225) one may “solve” (3) because
  x·sin(θ₄) + (z–0.39225)·cos(θ₄) = R·cos(θ₄–φ).
Thus one must have
  cos(θ₄–φ) = K/R  →  θ₄ = φ ± acos(K/R).

Once θ₄ is chosen (here we take the “+” branch), then from (1) one may “subtract” the wrist (that is, define the “virtual” wrist point p₁ = p – [0.09465·sin(θ₄), 0.093, 0.39225+0.09465·cos(θ₄)]). In our full solution we then use the closed‐form solution (already given as “Existing code 1”) for solving

  p₁ = [0.425·sin(θ₂)·cos(θ₁) – 0.01615·sin(θ₁),
     0.425·sin(θ₂)·sin(θ₁) + 0.01615·cos(θ₁),
     0.425·cos(θ₂)].

In other words, define
  x₁ = x – 0.09465·sin(θ₄),
  y₁ = y – 0.093,
  z₁ = z – 0.39225 – 0.09465·cos(θ₄).
Then one may take
  θ₂ = acos(z₁/0.425)
and, letting A = 0.425·sin(θ₂) and B = 0.01615,
  θ₁ = atan2(–B·x₁ + A·y₁, A·x₁ + B·y₁).

Finally, we set the extra joint (θ₃) to zero and (since θ₅ does not affect the TCP position) we choose θ₅ = 0.

A complete Python function is given below. (Any correct answer is acceptable.)

Explanation:

1. We first “remove” the wrist (last‐chain) contribution by writing the TCP as (p₃ + wrist_offset). In our manipulator the offset is [L_d*sin(θ₄), d_y, d_z+L_d*cos(θ₄)]. Expanding the squared distance between p and this wrist offset shows that
  x·sin(θ₄) + (z–d_z)·cos(θ₄) = K.
By writing R = √(x²+(z–d_z)²) and φ = atan2(x, z–d_z) one obtains a closed‐form for θ₄.

2. With θ₄ in hand the “virtual” target for joints 1–2 is p₁ = p – [L_d*sin(θ₄), d_y, d_z + L_d*cos(θ₄)]. Then using the same derivation as in “Existing code 1,” one computes θ₂ = acos(z₁/L_a) and θ₁ by comparing the x–y components.

3. Finally, we set θ₃ and θ₅ to zero. (Any value for these “redundant” joints that leaves p unchanged is valid.)

This solution (which relies only on elementary functions) produces one acceptable closed‐form answer to the inverse kinematics problem, and no testing code is included as requested.
