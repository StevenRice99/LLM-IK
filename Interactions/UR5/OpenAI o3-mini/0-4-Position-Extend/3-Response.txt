Below is one acceptable solution. In this version we first “back‐off” the TCP’s fixed offset (0,0,0.09465) so that the IK for the first four joints is computed for the wrist center (i.e. the origin of link 5, which already includes the translation [0, 0.093] from link 4). (Because the last joint rotates about Z the following TCP translation is independent of q5.) Once q1–q4 are computed using the same closed‐form method as before (with p replaced by p_wc = [x,y,z – 0.09465]), we set q5 to 0 (a free parameter that does not affect position). 

Below is the complete Python function:

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" (the TCP position) for the 5-DOF robot.
    The robot chain consists of 5 revolute joints with the following geometric parameters:
      • Joint 1 (axis Z) at [0, 0, 0]
      • Joint 2 (axis Y) at [0, 0.13585, 0]
      • Joint 3 (axis Y) at [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
      • Joint 4 (axis Y) at [0, 0, 0.39225]
      • Joint 5 (axis Z) at [0, 0.093, 0]
    The TCP is attached via a constant offset [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 5.
    
    The closed‐form solution is found by first computing the wrist center:
         p_wc = p – [0, 0, 0.09465]
    and then using the same law‐of‐cosines approach as given in the provided code (which assumed that p was the end of link 5).
    q5 is redundant (for position) so we set it equal to zero.
    
    :param p: The target TCP position to reach in [x, y, z].
    :return: A five-element tuple of joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5) in radians.

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of key points:
1. We subtract the fixed TCP z-offset (0.09465) to compute the wrist center position.
2. Using the wrist center, the joint angles q1, q2, and q3 are computed via closed‐form expressions (using the law of cosines and related geometric constructions).
3. q4 is set to zero and q5 is chosen arbitrarily as zero because they do not affect TCP position.

This solution satisfies the instructions for a closed-form analytical inverse kinematics method for the 5-DOF chain when only the TCP position is provided.
