Below is one acceptable complete solution. In this version we “decouple” the TCP offset (the final fixed translation of 0.09465 m along Z from the origin of link 5) from the sub‐chain inverse kinematics. (The provided “EXISTING” code was written so that if you supply as target the position of link 5’s origin then it returns four joint angles that bring that point into place.) Thus, given a desired TCP position p, we first define

  p_sub = p – [0, 0, 0.09465]

so that p_sub is the desired location of link 5’s origin. (Note that the constant 0.10915 which appears inside the EXISTING code comes from the fact that the y‑axis offset on link 2 combined with the translation on link 5 equals 0.10915.) Then we use the same closed‐form formulas as in the EXISTING code to compute q1, q2, q3 and (by convention) set q4 = 0. Finally, because the TCP translation itself is along the z‑axis—and a rotation about z (joint 5’s axis) does not change that translation—we choose q5 = 0. (Any value would “solve” the position; here we pick zero for definiteness.)

One acceptable implementation is as follows:

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach TCP position "p".
    The five-DOF robot’s geometry is given by:
      • Revolute 1: pos = [0,0,0], axis = Z.
      • Revolute 2: pos = [0, 0.13585, 0], axis = Y.
      • Revolute 3: pos = [0, -0.1197, 0.425], axis = Y.
      • Revolute 4: pos = [0, 0, 0.39225], axis = Y.
      • Revolute 5: pos = [0, 0.093, 0], axis = Z.
      • TCP: pos = [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to the frame after link 5.
      
    The provided sub-chain IK (for joints 1–4) was written so that if one supplies as target
    the desired position of the origin of link 5 then the four joint angles are returned.
    Since the TCP is displaced by [0,0,0.09465] from link 5’s origin,
    we subtract that offset from the input target and then use the same formulas.

------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if the desired TCP position is the one obtained by zero joints (i.e. [0, 0.10915, 0.9119] as given by the forward kinematics),
then
  p_sub = [0, 0.10915, 0.9119 – 0.09465] = [0, 0.10915, 0.81725],
and the sub‐chain IK returns (q1,q2,q3,q4) very nearly (0,0,0,0). (Any small differences are due to rounding in the constants.)

This solution meets the requirements.
