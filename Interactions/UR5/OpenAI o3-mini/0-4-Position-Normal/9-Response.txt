Below is one acceptable closed‐form solution. In our solution we first “remove” the base’s rotation by choosing q₁ so that when the target position p is rotated back into the “arm plane” the fixed offset in the y‑direction is recovered. (In our convention the y offset between joint 1 and joint 2 is 0.13585 while the later link translations subtract 0.1197 and add 0.093 so that the net “sideways” offset is 0.10915.) Then the remaining problem is equivalent to a 2R planar arm (with link lengths L₁ = 0.425 and L₂ = 0.4869) whose forward kinematics are

  pₓ′ = L₁·sin(q₂) + L₂·sin(q₂+q₃)   and  p_z = L₁·cos(q₂) + L₂·cos(q₂+q₃).

One acceptable solution is to choose q₄ = 0 and q₅ = 0. (Note that an infinite family of solutions exist.) One complete implementation is given below.

    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    The manipulator details are:

      • Joint 1: Revolute about Z at [0,0,0].
      • Joint 2: Revolute about Y with a translation of [0, 0.13585, 0] from joint 1.
      • Joint 3: Revolute about Y with a translation of [0, -0.1197, 0.425] from joint 2.
      • Joint 4: Revolute about Y with a translation of [0, 0, 0.39225] from joint 3.
      • Joint 5: Revolute about Z with a translation of [0, 0.093, 0] from joint 4.
      • TCP:    Translation of [0, 0, 0.09465] from joint 5.
      
    In our solution we assume q₄ = 0 and q₅ = 0.
    
    First, note that the overall forward kinematics (when q₄ and q₅ are zero) may be written as:
    
      p = Rz(q₁) * V
      where V = [ Vₓ, V_y, V_z ] with
          Vₓ = 0.425 sin(q₂) + 0.4869 sin(q₂+q₃)
          V_y = 0.13585 - 0.1197 + 0.093 = 0.10915   (constant)
          V_z = 0.425 cos(q₂) + 0.4869 cos(q₂+q₃)
    
    To “remove” the rotation Rz(q₁) we require that when p is rotated by -q₁ the y‐component of the result equals 0.10915.
    Writing Rz(–q₁)*p = [p′ₓ, p′_y, p_z] and letting H = sqrt(pₓ²+p_y²),
    one may show that p′_y = –sin(q₁)pₓ + cos(q₁)p_y.
    Thus we choose q₁ so that:
    
         – sin(q₁)pₓ + cos(q₁)p_y = 0.10915.
         
    One way to do this is to write pₓ and p_y in “polar form”. In particular, if we define δ such that
         p_y = H cos δ   and   pₓ = H sin δ,
    then the above condition is equivalent to:
    
         H cos(q₁+δ) = 0.10915    ⇒  q₁ = arccos(0.10915/H) – δ.
    
    Finally, the planar (2R) inverse kinematics for q₂ and q₃ is obtained by letting
    
         r = sqrt((p′ₓ)² + (p_z)²)
         with  p′ₓ = cos(q₁)pₓ + sin(q₁)p_y,
    and then using the cosine law:
    
         cos(q₃) = (r² – L₁² – L₂²)/(2 L₁ L₂)         [with L₁ = 0.425, L₂ = 0.4869]
         q₃ = acos( … )
         
         and
         
         q₂ = atan2(p′ₓ, p_z) – atan2(L₂ sin(q₃), L₁ + L₂ cos(q₃)).
         
    The following implementation follows this procedure.

Explanation of key steps:

1. We first determine q₁ by “aligning” the target p so that when rotated by –q₁ the resulting y‑coordinate equals 0.10915 (the net offset coming from joints 2–TCP). Writing p in polar form (with p_y = H cosδ, pₓ = H sinδ) leads to the relation
  cos(q₁+δ) = 0.10915/H  ⇒  q₁ = arccos(0.10915/H) – δ.

2. Then with p rotated (p′ = Rz(–q₁)·p), the 2R planar arm (with link lengths 0.425 and 0.4869) must satisfy:
  p′ₓ = L₁ sin(q₂) + L₂ sin(q₂+q₃)  and  p_z = L₁ cos(q₂) + L₂ cos(q₂+q₃).
Standard geometric formulas give q₃ (via the cosine law) and then q₂.

3. Finally, we set q₄ = q₅ = 0.

This solution meets the requirements stated and (when plugged into the provided forward kinematics) yields the expected TCP positions.
