Below is one complete analytical solution. In this solution we first “back‐out” the wrist center (the location of joint 4) by subtracting the known TCP offset (the combination of joint‐5 and tool translations) transformed by the desired RPY orientation. Then, we solve for the base (joint 1) by “aiming” from the wrist center toward the shoulder offset. (In our robot the shoulder – joint 2 – is fixed at [0,0.13585,0] in the base frame so that when the wrist center lies along the “+Y” direction one finds joint 1 = 0.) Next, treating the 2R part (joints 2 and 3) as a planar 2‐link arm (with effective link lengths 0.425 and 0.39225 reaching from the shoulder to the wrist center) we use the cosine–law to compute the “elbow” angle and then the shoulder angle from the “line-of-sight” to the wrist center. Finally, we “close” the arm by demanding that the overall arm rotation (joints 2+3+4) match the “arm angle” β that can be extracted from the desired end–effector rotation (when it is factored as a rotation about Z, then about Y, then about Z). The remaining joint (joint 5) is then computed by “subtracting” the obtained arm’s rotation from the target. (Note that the robot is only capable of the subset of 6DOF orientations that factor as Rz(θ₁)·Ry(β)·Rz(θ₅).)

A complete Python solution follows:

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float], 
                       r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values required to reach TCP position p with RPY orientation r.
    The robot’s chain is:
      • Joint 1: Revolute about Z, located at the origin.
      • Joint 2: Revolute about Y, with translation [0, 0.13585, 0] from joint1.
      • Joint 3: Revolute about Y, with translation [0, -0.1197, 0.425] from joint2.
      • Joint 4: Revolute about Y, with translation [0, 0, 0.39225] from joint3.
      • Joint 5: Revolute about Z, with translation [0, 0.093, 0] from joint4.
    The TCP is further translated by [0, 0, 0.09465] relative to joint 5.
    
    We assume that the target’s orientation is reachable – i.e. it is of the form
         R_target = Rz(theta1) * Ry(beta) * Rz(theta5)
    for some angles.
    
    The solution proceeds by:
      1. Computing the desired 3×3 rotation R_target from r (using Rz*Ry*Rx with r = [roll, pitch, yaw]).
      2. Subtracting the effect of the TCP offset (p_tool = [0, 0.093, 0.09465]) to obtain the wrist center (joint 4) position.
      3. Solving for joint 1 as the “aiming” angle (here defined so that when the wrist center lies along the +Y axis, theta1 = 0).
      4. Expressing the 2R (joints 2–3) problem from the shoulder (joint2 at Rz(theta1)*[0,0.13585,0]) to the wrist center.
      5. Using the cosine law on the effective 2D problem (in the X–Z plane, which is preserved when rotating about Y) to compute the elbow (joint 3) and shoulder (joint 2) angles.
      6. Setting joint 4 so that the total rotation from joints 2+3+4 matches β, where β is extracted from R_target.
      7. Finally, computing joint 5 from the residual rotation.
      
    :param p: The target TCP position [x, y, z].
    :param r: The target TCP orientation in RPY (roll, pitch, yaw), in radians.
    :return: A tuple (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4, theta5).

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of key points:
1. p_tool (=[0, 0.093, 0.09465]) represents the combined translation of joint 5’s origin and the TCP offset in that frame.
2. By computing p_wrist = p – R_target·p_tool the IK decouples into a “position” problem (solved by joints 1–3) and an “orientation” (wrist) problem (solved by joints 4–5).
3. Joint 1 is solved using a modified atan2 so that when the wrist center lies along the robot’s positive Y–axis the base angle is zero.
4. The 2R planar subproblem for joints 2–3 is solved using the cosine law (using L1 = 0.425 and L2 = 0.39225).
5. Joint 4 “closes” the arm to match β, the portion of R_target that must be achieved by the Y–rotations.
6. Finally, joint 5 is extracted by “removing” the arm’s contribution from the target rotation.

This function assumes all targets are reachable.
