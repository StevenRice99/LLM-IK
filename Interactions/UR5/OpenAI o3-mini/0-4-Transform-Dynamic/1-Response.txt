Below is one complete closed‐form solution. In our solution we first compute the base (joint 1) angle from the global TCP position (using the same “Existing code 1” idea). Then we “decouple” the remaining joints by first expressing the TCP in the shoulder (joint 2) frame – that is, subtracting the fixed offset [0, 0.13585, 0] (which appears when moving from link 1 to link 2) and “undoing” the base rotation. In that frame the chain (joints 2–4) moves in a plane (with the convention here that zero “arm angle” points along the positive z‐axis and positive rotation “sweeps” toward positive x). Next we compute the wrist center by subtracting the TCP’s final offset (0.09465) along the direction implied by the target orientation. Then a 2‐link inverse kinematics (with link lengths a = 0.425 and b = 0.39225) is used to compute (joint 2, joint 3) so that the sum with joint 4 (set so that the overall “arm angle” equals θsum—extracted from the rotated target orientation) is satisfied. Finally, the remaining (wrist or joint 5) rotation about Z is obtained via a wrist decoupling step. (Note that this solution uses standard math, NumPy, and follows the logic of the provided “EXISTING” sub‐solutions.)

------------------------------------------------

In this solution:
• q1 is computed as in Existing code 1.
• The TCP position is “moved” into joint 2’s frame (by subtracting the fixed offset and inverting the base rotation).
• Then, using the task-space orientation we extract a “planar” orientation angle (θsum) so that we can subtract the final TCP offset.
• A two‐link (planar) solution (with link lengths a and b) provides q2 and q3; q4 is set to complete the sum.
• Finally, the remaining orientation error is removed in a decoupling step that yields q5.

This solution satisfies the given design (with joint limits and axes as in the DETAILS table) and uses only built–in math, NumPy, and Sympy–allowed methods.
