Below is one valid analytical solution. In our solution we note that the overall forward‐kinematics factors into a “base” rotation about Z (q₁) that rotates a “planar” 3R chain (with links of effective lengths 0.425, 0.39225, and 0.09465) plus a final rotation about Z (q₅). In particular, one may show that the TCP position (p) can be “unrotated” by q₁ so that

  p̄ = Rz(–q₁)·p = [X, Y, Z]  with Y = 0.13585 – 0.1197 + 0.093 = 0.10915

so that q₁ is chosen to force the second (y) component to that constant. (A short algebra yields that if p = [pₓ, p_y, p_z] then
  –pₓ·sin(q₁) + p_y·cos(q₁) = 0.10915.
One may write this as
  √(pₓ²+p_y²)·cos(q₁+δ) = 0.10915  with δ = atan2(–pₓ, p_y),
so that one valid solution is  
  q₁ = acos(0.10915/√(pₓ²+p_y²)) – δ.)

Once q₁ is known, the desired tool orientation (given as roll/pitch/yaw in r) is used to “decouple” the remaining degree of freedom. One may show that the full rotation matrix factors as

  R = Rz(q₁) · [R_y(q₂+q₃+q₄) · Rz(q₅)]

so that with
  M = Rz(–q₁)·R_des   (with R_des built from r = [roll, pitch, yaw] in URDF order, i.e. R_des = Rz(yaw)·R_y(pitch)·R_x(roll))
one may extract  
  φ = q₂+q₃+q₄ = atan2(M[0,2], M[2,2])  and  q₅ = atan2(M[1,0], M[1,1]).

The position part now reduces to “removing” the last link (which contributes a fixed offset L₃ = 0.09465 along the direction φ) from p̄ giving an effective 2R arm:
  [Pₓ, P_z] = [p̄ₓ – L₃·sin(φ), p̄_z – L₃·cos(φ)]  
which must be reached by two links of lengths L₁ = 0.425 and L₂ = 0.39225. Standard geometry (law of cosines) then gives
  q₃ = arccos((r₂² – L₁² – L₂²)/(2·L₁·L₂))  with r₂ = √(Pₓ²+P_z²)
and
  q₂ = atan2(Pₓ, P_z) – atan2(L₂·sin(q₃), L₁+L₂·cos(q₃)).
Finally, the remaining joint angle is recovered from  
  q₄ = φ – (q₂+q₃).

One acceptable complete implementation is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------
def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float],
                       r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values (in radians) to reach position p and orientation r.
    p: An (x, y, z) tuple for the target TCP position.
    r: An (roll, pitch, yaw) tuple (in radians) for the target TCP orientation.
    
    The robot’s kinematics are summarized as:
      • Joint 1: rotation about Z, with no offset.
      • Joint 2: a fixed translation (0, 0.13585, 0) then rotation about Y.
      • Joint 3: a fixed translation (0, -0.1197, 0.425) then rotation about Y.
      • Joint 4: a fixed translation (0, 0, 0.39225) then rotation about Y.
      • Joint 5: a fixed translation (0, 0.093, 0) then rotation about Z.
      • TCP: a final fixed translation (0, 0, 0.09465).
    
    The derivation below uses the fact that the product transform factors as:
         p_TCP = Rz(q₁) · { p_planar(q₂,q₃,q₄) }  
         R_total = Rz(q₁) · [ R_y(q₂+q₃+q₄) · Rz(q₅) ]
    so that the y–component of the “unrotated” position p̄ = Rz(–q₁)·p must equal
         0.13585 – 0.1197 + 0.093 = 0.10915.
    
    This yields q₁, then the desired tool orientation (built as R_des = Rz(yaw) R_y(pitch) R_x(roll))
    is “unwrapped” by Rz(–q₁) so that one can extract φ = q₂+q₃+q₄ and q₅.
    
    Finally, subtracting the link 5/TCP offset (L₃ = 0.09465) yields an effective 2R arm for which
    standard geometric IK yields q₂ and q₃ (and hence q₄ = φ – (q₂+q₃)).
