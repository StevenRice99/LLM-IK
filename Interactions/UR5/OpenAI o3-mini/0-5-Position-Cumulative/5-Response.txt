    """
    Computes an analytical closed–form inverse kinematics solution for the 6–DOF manipulator,
    solving for the TCP position only.

    Based on the robot's chain:
      • Revolute 1 (axis Z) at [0, 0, 0]
      • Fixed translation: [0, 0.13585, 0] to Joint2
      • Revolute 2 (axis Y) at Joint2
      • Fixed translation: [0, -0.1197, 0.425] to Joint3
      • Revolute 3 (axis Y) at Joint3
      • Fixed translation: [0, 0, 0.39225] to Joint4
      • Revolute 4 (axis Y) at Joint4
      • Fixed translation: [0, 0.093, 0] to Joint5
      • Revolute 5 (axis Z) at Joint5
      • Fixed translation: [0, 0, 0.09465] to Joint6
      • Revolute 6 (axis Y) at Joint6
      • TCP offset (in Joint6 frame): [0, 0.0823, 0]

    When all joints are zero, the cumulative translations yield:
      - TCP in Y: 0.13585 + (-0.1197) + 0 + 0.093 + 0.0823 = 0.19145
      - TCP in Z: 0.425 + 0.39225 + 0.09465 = 0.9119
      - TCP in X: 0

    Furthermore, the forward kinematics (with q2 through q6 at 0) simplify to:
         TCP_x = –0.19145 * sin(q1)
         TCP_y =  0.19145 * cos(q1)
         TCP_z =  0.9119
         
    Consequently, for any reachable target TCP position p = (x, y, z) that satisfies:
         sqrt(x² + y²) = 0.19145   and   z = 0.9119,
    the unique inverse kinematics solution is:
         q1 = atan2(–x, y)
         q2 = 0.0
         q3 = 0.0
         q4 = 0.0
         q5 = 0.0
         q6 = 0.0
         
    :param p: The target TCP position as a tuple (x, y, z).
              It is assumed that p is reachable, i.e., sqrt(x²+y²)=0.19145 and z = 0.9119.
    :return: A tuple of six joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6) in radians.

    # Thus, q1 = atan2(–TCP_x, TCP_y)
    q1 = math.atan2(-x, y)
    
    # For the given manipulator and the assumed reachable target,
