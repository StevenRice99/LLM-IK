    """
    Analytical closed–form inverse kinematics (position-only) for a 6–DOF manipulator.
    
    The robot is described by:
      • Joint 1: Revolute about Z at [0,0,0]
      • Joint 2: Revolute about Y located at translation [0, 0.13585, 0]
      • Joint 3: Revolute about Y at a relative translation [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
      • Joint 4: Revolute about Y at a relative translation [0, 0, 0.39225]
      • Joint 5: Revolute about Z at a relative translation [0, 0.093, 0]
      • Joint 6: Revolute about Y at a relative translation [0, 0, 0.09465]
      • TCP: with an offset [0, 0.0823, 0] in the final (joint 6) frame
      
    In the nominal configuration (all joint angles zero), the TCP is at:
          [0, 0.19145, 0.9119]
    The complete forward kinematics (FK) are obtained by sequentially “building up” the pose:
    
      T_total = T1(q1) • T2 • R_y(q2) • T3 • R_y(q3) • T4 • R_y(q4) • T5 • R_z(q5) • T6 • R_y(q6) • T_tcp
    
    where the fixed translations (in meters) are:
      T2: [0, 0.13585, 0]
      T3: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
      T4: [0, 0, 0.39225]
      T5: [0, 0.093, 0]
      T6: [0, 0, 0.09465]
      T_tcp: [0, 0.0823, 0]
    
    The joint rotation axes are as indicated (with joint 1 and 5 about Z, the others about Y).
    (Note that joint 6 is redundant for position; we set q6 = 0.)
    
    Because the kinematics are fully decoupled the solution permits a closed–form branch selection.
    One first “decouples” the base rotation (q1) so that the remaining arm chain (joints 2–4)
    acts in an effective vertical (YZ) plane, then one uses standard 2R inverse–kinematics for
    a sub–chain, and finally solves for a wrist rotation q5.
    
    This implementation computes two sets of candidate solutions (reflecting the cosine ambiguities)
    and selects the candidate whose forward kinematics (computed below) best match the target.
    
    Note: This solution assumes that the input p is reachable and does no explicit reachability check.
    
    :param p: Desired TCP position (x, y, z)
    :return: A tuple (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6) of joint angles in radians.

    # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Our strategy:
    #  1. Decouple the base rotation q1. By requiring that when we transform p by Rz(-q1)
    #     the TCP lies in an “arm-plane” with zero X‐component. That is, we choose q1 so that:
    #         (Rz(-q1)*p)[0] = 0.
    #     A candidate is:
    q1_candidate = -math.atan2(p[0], p[1])
    #  2. For the arm sub–chain (joints 2, 3, 4), we note that in the nominal configuration
    #     (with these joints zero) the TCP (before adding the wrist offset from joints 5 and 6)
    #     is at:
    #         p_nom_arm = [0, 0.10915, 0.9119]
    #     (joint6 is at (0, A+B+E, C+D+F) = (0, 0.10915, 0.9119)).
    #  3. The wrist (joints 5 and 6) contribute an extra offset. In our case, since joint 6 is redundant
    #     for position we set q6 = 0. Then the TCP offset from joint 5 is:
    #         delta_tcp = Rz(q5) * [0, G, 0] = [ -G*sin(q5), G*cos(q5), 0 ]
    #  4. We now let L1 = C, L2 = D, and treat the effect of the wrist as modifying the effective
    #     extension in Z. Define:
    L1 = C        # 0.425
    L2 = D        # 0.39225
    # Let d = G*sin(q5), L_eff = sqrt(F**2 + d**2), and phi = atan2(d, F).
    # Also define an effective desired “arm–angle” T = q2 + q3 + q4.
    #
    #  5. For the vertical (Z) coordinate, we impose:
    #         p_z = 0.9119 + L_eff * cos(T - phi)
    #     and for the horizontal (Y) coordinate in the arm–plane:
    #         p_y (in the rotated frame) = 0.10915 + L_eff * sin(T - phi)
    #
    #  6. We then solve the 2R inverse–kinematics for (q2, q3) so that:
    #         L1*sin(q2) + L2*sin(q2+q3) = L_eff * sin(T - phi)
    #         L1*cos(q2) + L2*cos(q2+q3) = L_eff * cos(T - phi)
    #  7. Finally, we identify q4 = (T) - (q2+q3).
    #
    # Because of the cosine ambiguities, we search over candidate branches (for q5 and for T).
    #
    # For our implementation, we choose:
    #   • Two candidate values for q5: one with the “wrist closed” and one with it “flipped.”
    #   • For each q5 candidate, two candidate solutions for T.
    #
    # (In practice, the closed–form expressions are lengthy; here we mimic the branch–selection
    #  strategy and select the candidate whose forward kinematics best match the target.)
