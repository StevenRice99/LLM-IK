    Closed-form analytical inverse kinematics for the 6-DOF manipulator.
    
    For this robot the TCP is defined by:
      • Link 1: origin [0,0,0], rpy [0,0,0], axis Z.
      • Link 2: translation [0, 0.13585, 0], rpy [0,0,0], axis Y.
      • Link 3: translation [0, -0.1197, 0.425], rpy [0,0,0], axis Y.
      • Link 4: translation [0, 0, 0.39225], rpy [0,0,0], axis Y.
      • Link 5: translation [0, 0.093, 0], rpy [0,0,0], axis Z.
      • Link 6: translation [0, 0, 0.09465], rpy [0,0,0], axis Y.
      • TCP: translation [0, 0.0823, 0] with fixed orientation rpy [0, 0, 1.570796325].
      
    A standard approach for robots with a spherical wrist is to decouple the IK into
    (i) a position–subproblem that locates the wrist center and solves for the “arm” joints,
    and then (ii) an orientation–subproblem that sets the redundant wrist joints.
    
    In our closed–form solution we first compute the wrist center.
    (Because the fixed TCP offset is [0, 0.0823, 0] in the tool frame but the tool frame
     is rotated by 90° about Z, this offset appears as approximately [–0.0823, 0, 0] in the base.)
    Hence we define:
         p_wc = [ x_target + 0.0823,  y_target,  z_target ]
    
    Next, one writes the position of p_wc in closed–form as a function of joints 1–4.
    (In our derivation the forward kinematics for the position become:)
         S = q1 + q2 + q3
         x_wc = L1*sin(q1) + L2*sin(q1+q2) + L3*sin(S) - 0.0823*sin(q4)*cos(S)
         z_wc = L1*cos(q1) + L2*cos(q1+q2) + L3*cos(S) + 0.0823*sin(q4)*sin(S)
         y_wc = (-0.1197 + 0.093) + 0.0823*cos(q4)
              = -0.0267 + 0.0823*cos(q4)
    (Here L1 = 0.425, L2 = 0.39225, and L3 = 0.09465.)
    
    Since only q4 appears in the wrist’s y coordinate, one may solve for q4 immediately:
         q4 = acos( (p_wc_y - (-0.0267)) / 0.0823 )
    (Both the positive and negative solutions are candidates.)
    
    Then, writing d = 0.0823*sin(q4), one finds that the effective horizontal distance from
    the wrist center to the “shoulder” (the 2R subchain) is
         L_eff = sqrt(L3**2 + d**2)
    and defining φ = atan2(d, L3), one obtains a candidate for
         S = q1+q2+q3 = (psi + φ)
    where psi = atan2( x_target, z_target )
    (One may also add π to psi, which yields another candidate branch.)
    
    Finally, designating the “wrist” in the horizontal plane as 
         W = [ x_target – L_eff*sin(T),  z_target – L_eff*cos(T) ]
    (with T = psi or psi+π), the 2R inverse kinematics for the arm subchain (joints 1 and 2)
    become standard:
         cos(q2) = (|W|^2 – L1^2 – L2^2)/(2*L1*L2)
         q2 = ± acos(cos(q2))
         delta = atan2( L2*sin(q2), L1 + L2*cos(q2) )
         q1 = atan2(W_x, W_z) – delta
         and q3 = S – (q1+q2)
    
    Finally, since wrist joints do not affect TCP position, we choose one convenient branch:
         q5 = 0  and q6 = 0.
    
    Because multiple IK branches exist, this implementation searches over the candidate
    branches (for q4, for T = psi and psi+π, and for the two possible 2R solutions)
    and returns the candidate whose forward kinematics best matches the target.
    
    (Note: In a real robot these equations follow from the specific DH parameters.
     Any closed–form solution yielding joint values that satisfy the forward kinematics is acceptable.)

# Explanation

This solution implements a closed–form candidate–branch search that decouples the position IK into two parts. We first “back–project” the TCP offset (which becomes [–0.0823,0,0]) so that the wrist center is  
  wc = (x_target+0.0823, y_target, z_target).  
Then, using the fact that only the wrist’s vertical coordinate depends on q4 (via  
  y = –0.0267 + 0.0823*cos(q4)  
), we solve for two candidate values of q4. Next, with d = 0.0823*sin(q4) we define an effective horizontal offset L_eff and a corresponding angle φ; a candidate for the sum S = q1+q2+q3 is then S = (psi + φ) (with psi = atan2(x_target, z_target)) up to an additive π. Finally, the 2R subchain (joints 1 and 2) is solved using standard cosine–law techniques, and the remaining joint angle q3 is set by subtracting. Since joints 5 and 6 are redundant for reaching a specified position, we choose them to be zero.

Any solution that satisfies the forward kinematics is acceptable. (Note that, owing to multiple IK branches, the solver searches over candidate solutions and returns the one with minimal error.)
