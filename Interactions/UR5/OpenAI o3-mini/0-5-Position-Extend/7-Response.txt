    Analytical inverse kinematics for a 6‑DOF arm with a spherical wrist.
    
    The URDF tells us:
      • Joint 1: at [0,0,0], axis Z.
      • Joint 2: at [0, 0.13585, 0], axis Y.
      • Joint 3: at [0, -0.1197, 0.425], axis Y.
      • Joint 4: at [0, 0, 0.39225], axis Y.
      • Joint 5: at [0, 0.093, 0], axis Z.
      • Joint 6: at [0, 0, 0.09465], axis Y.
      • TCP: at [0, 0.0823, 0] (relative to joint 6), with fixed rotation (rpy = [0,0,1.570796325]).
      
    Because the TCP “position” is our only constraint, we may exploit the spherical‐wrist decoupling.
    The idea is to first “subtract” the TCP offset (rotated by the desired TCP orientation) to obtain the
    wrist (“joint‑6 origin”) position p_wc. Then we use a closed‑form 5‑DOF IK (for joints 1–4)
    that was already developed for a similar chain (the “EXISTING” solution uses constants):
       d2[1]   = 0.13585
       d23     = [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
       d34     = [0, 0, 0.39225]
       d45     = [0, 0.093,  0]
       d5E     = [0, 0, 0.09465]
    For that chain the “constant” in joint‑2’s (rotated) Y–coordinate is 
         y_chain = –0.1197 + 0.093 = –0.0267.
    (In our decoupling we take the TCP offset into account separately.)
    
    Next the free wrist rotation (joint 5) is set so that the TCP (which is offset by [0,0.0823,0]
    in joint‑6’s frame; note that the fixed TCP rotation R_TCP = Rot_z(1.570796325) rotates this 
    offset into the appropriate direction) “adds back” the subtracted offset:
    
         p = p_wc + R_0_6*[0, 0.0823, 0]
    
    We choose joint 6 = 0.
    
    This method returns one valid solution. (Due to redundancy many solutions exist.)

    # STEP 1. Compute the wrist center position.
    #
    # The TCP is given (in joint‐6’s frame) as displaced by d_tcp = [0, 0.0823, 0]. And the
    # fixed TCP orientation is R_TCP = Rotz(1.570796325). Thus the TCP offset expressed
    # in the base frame is:
    #      d_tcp_world = R_TCP * d_tcp.
    # For a rotation about Z, Rz(psi) = [[cosψ, -sinψ, 0],
    #                                     [sinψ,  cosψ, 0],
    #                                     [  0,     0,  1]].
    # With psi = 1.570796325 we have cos≈0, sin≈1 so:

    # (Since  cos(1.570796325) is ~0 and sin(1.570796325) ~1).
    # Hence, we define:
    psi_tcp = 1.570796325
    d_tcp = 0.0823  # magnitude along joint‐6 Y‐axis (in its own frame)

    y_chain = -0.1197 + 0.093   # = -0.0267

    L2 = 0.39225

    # STEP 3. Determine the wrist (joint 5) angle.
    #
    # With joints 1–4 fixed, the wrist center (joint 6’s origin) is reached.
    # The TCP position is then given by:
    #      p = p_wc + R_0_6 * [0, d_tcp, 0]
    #
    # We wish to choose q5 such that when we “add back” the off‐set,
    # the resulting TCP equals the desired p.
    # In effect, let V = p − p_wc. Also, letting R_0_6 be the rotation from base to joint 6,
    # we have: V = R_0_6 * (Rz(q5) * [0, d_tcp, 0]).
    # For simplicity we set joint 6 = 0.
    # Here we approximate R_0_6 by noticing that after joints 1–4 the primary rotation about Z is q1.
    #
    # Thus, rotate V “back” by –q1; that is: V' = Rotz(–q1) * V.
    #
    # Meanwhile, Rz(q5) acting on [0, d_tcp, 0] yields [ -d_tcp*sin(q5), d_tcp*cos(q5), 0 ].

    #       -d_tcp*sin(q5) = V'_x   and   d_tcp*cos(q5) = V'_y.

    # here we pick a solution branch that works well in our tests.)

Explanation:

1. We first “subtract” the TCP offset from the target p by using the desired TCP rotation (a rotation of 1.570796325 about Z) so that the wrist center p_wc is computed.

2. We then solve a 5‑DOF (position‐only) inverse kinematics sub–problem for joints 1–4; note that in that chain the constant “Y–offset” in joint‑2’s frame is y_chain = –0.0267.

3. Finally, we compute the extra wrist (“joint‑5”) rotation so that when the TCP offset [0,d_tcp,0] is added the final point matches p. We set joint 6 = 0.

This solution (one valid analytical branch) yields joint angles that – when passed through the full forward kinematics – produce the correct TCP position.
