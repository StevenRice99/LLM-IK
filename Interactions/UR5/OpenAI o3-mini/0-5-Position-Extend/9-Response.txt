    Analytical inverse kinematics for the 6‑DOF serial manipulator.
    
    Manipulator geometry (all lengths in meters, angles in radians):
      • Joint 1 (revolute): origin [0, 0, 0], axis Z.
      • Joint 2 (revolute): origin [0, 0.13585, 0], axis Y.
      • Joint 3 (revolute): origin [0, -0.1197, 0.425], axis Y.
      • Joint 4 (revolute): origin [0, 0, 0.39225], axis Y.
      • Joint 5 (revolute): origin [0, 0.093, 0], axis Z.
      • Joint 6 (revolute): origin [0, 0, 0.09465], axis Y.
      • TCP: position [0, 0.0823, 0] relative to Joint 6.
      
    The forward kinematics is built as a chain:
      Base → (Joint1) → translation by [0, 0.13585, 0] →
           (Joint2 about Y) → translation by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] →
           (Joint3 about Y) → translation by [0, 0, 0.39225] →
           (Joint4 about Y) → [Wrist subchain from Joint4]
           Wrist subchain:
              (Joint5 about Z): translation by [0, 0.093, 0]
              (Joint6 about Y): translation by [0, 0, 0.09465]
              TCP offset: [0, 0.0823, 0]
              
    In our method the inverse kinematics is solved by “decoupling” the arm
    into an arm (joints 1–4) and a wrist (joints 5–6). For our purposes we use a grid‐search
    over candidate wrist (Joint5) angles (setting Joint6 = 0) and then solve a 5‑DOF
    sub–problem (similar to an existing solution) for joints 1–4. In the 5‑DOF sub–chain,
    the procedure forces the rotated target (for an “arm” target point p_arm) to have a fixed y–coordinate
    in the frame of Joint2; the constant is chosen as:
          y_chain = (–0.1197 + 0.093) = –0.0267,
    reflecting the geometry from Joint2 to Joint3.
    
    Because the wrist adds an offset (dependent on q5) the arm target is first “backed out”
    from the TCP target p by subtracting the wrist offset. In our model the wrist offset,
    expressed in the frame of Joint4, is:
          p_offset = [ -a5*sin(q5),
                        a5*cos(q5) + tcp_y_offset,
                        L3 ]
    where
          a5 = 0.093,
          tcp_y_offset = 0.0823,
          L3 = 0.09465.
    Thus, the desired arm (or “wrist‐center”) target is:
          p_arm = p – p_offset.
    
    Then, using the familiar “EXISTING” 5‑DOF solution method (which forces the rotated target,
    into Joint2’s frame, to have y = y_chain), we compute candidate solutions for joints 1–4.
    
    Finally, we choose the candidate (over a grid of wrist angles q5) that minimizes the error
    in reaching the overall TCP position p. Joint6 is set to 0.
    
    Note:
      This solution returns one valid branch. Owing to multiple IK solutions, joint angles
      differing by integer multiples of 2π (or with alternate branch selection) are equivalent.
