def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes the joint angles needed to reach the target TCP position p
    using a closed-form analytical solution for the specified 6 DOF manipulator.
    
    The forward kinematics (with joints 2, 4, 5, and 6 set to zero) are given by:
       TCP_x = cos(q1) * (L * sin(q3)) - sin(q1) * (L_offset)
       TCP_y = sin(q1) * (L * sin(q3)) + cos(q1) * (L_offset)
       TCP_z = d + L * cos(q3)
       
    The constant parameters (derived from the provided link table) are:
       d        = 0.425         (z offset from the third link)
       L        = 0.39225 + 0.09465 = 0.4869  (effective arm length from revolute 4 and 6)
       L_offset = 0.13585 - 0.1197 + 0.093 + 0.0823 = 0.19145 
                  (effective y translation from revolute 2, 3, 5, and the TCP)
    
    The solution is computed as follows:
      1. From the z-equation: 
            cos(q3) = (p_z - d) / L
         Thus, q3 = acos((p_z - d) / L)
         (The computed value for cos(q3) is clamped between -1 and 1 to avoid numerical errors.)
      
      2. Let Ls = L * sin(q3). Define angle gamma as:
            gamma = atan2(L_offset, Ls)
      
      3. In the x-y plane, the forward kinematics imply that the angle of the vector [p_x, p_y]
         is (q1 + gamma). Therefore, we compute:
            q1 = atan2(p_y, p_x) - gamma
      
      4. For the purposes of this decoupled solution, the remaining joints are set to zero:
            q2 = q4 = q5 = q6 = 0.0
    
    Parameters:
       p : tuple[float, float, float]
           The target TCP position in the form (p_x, p_y, p_z)
       
    Returns:
       Tuple[float, float, float, float, float, float]
           The joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6) in radians.
