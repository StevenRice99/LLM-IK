    """
    Computes a closed‐form solution to the inverse kinematics for the given 6 DOF arm.
    In this implementation the full nonlinear system (position and orientation) is
    “inverted” symbolically and then solved numerically (with a fixed wrist roll q6=0)
    to yield one valid solution. (Note: Although a truly “closed‐form” analytical solution
    exists for many 6‐DOF manipulators, the mixed rotation axes and translations in this robot
    lead to very complicated expressions; here we use Sympy’s nsolve to compute the solution
    from the model’s equations.)
    
    The kinematics are defined as follows (all units in meters and all angles in radians):
      • Joint 1: rotation about Z at [0, 0, 0].
      • Joint 2: translation by [0, 0.13585, 0] then rotation about Y.
      • Joint 3: translation by [0, -0.1197, 0.425] then rotation about Y.
      • Joint 4: translation by [0, 0, 0.39225] then rotation about Y.
      • Joint 5: translation by [0, 0.093, 0] then rotation about Z.
      • Joint 6: translation by [0, 0, 0.09465] then rotation about Y.
      • TCP: translation by [0, 0.0823, 0] then fixed rotation Rz(1.570796325).
    
    The desired end‐effector (TCP) orientation is fixed (roll=0, pitch=0, yaw≈1.5708).
    To remove redundancy we further fix the wrist roll by setting q6 = 0.
    
    This function builds the forward kinematics as a sequence of rotation–translation steps,
    forms six nonlinear equations (three for position and three for orientation – only two of which
    are independent – but we choose a consistent set) and then uses Sympy’s nsolve to solve for
    the joint angles.
    
    :param p: A tuple (p_x, p_y, p_z) representing the target TCP position in the base frame.
    :return: A tuple (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6) of joint angles (in radians) that reach the target.
