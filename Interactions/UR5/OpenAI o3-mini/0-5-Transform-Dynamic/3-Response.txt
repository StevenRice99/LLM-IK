Below is one acceptable complete solution. In this answer we “decouple” the 6‐DOF problem into an “arm” (joints 1–5) and a “wrist” (joint 6). First we solve for q1…q5 much like the provided 5–DOF solution (using the translation from joint 5 to joint 6, 0.09465, to “cancel” the wrist position) so that the resulting solution drives the origin of joint 6 to the proper “wrist–center.” Then we note that the full forward kinematics may be factored as

  R_total = Rz(q1) · Ry(q2+q3+q4) · Rz(q5) · [Ry(q6) · R_tcp]

where R_tcp is the fixed rotation from joint6 to the TCP (here R_tcp = Rz(1.570796325)). Since we have already computed
  R_arm = Rz(q1) · Ry(q2+q3+q4) · Rz(q5)
and we know the desired overall orientation R_des (built from the supplied roll–pitch–yaw using Rz(yaw)·Ry(pitch)·Rx(roll)), we have

  R_arm · [Ry(q6)·R_tcp] = R_des  ⟹  Ry(q6) = (R_armᵀ·R_des)·R_tcpᵀ

so that q6 = atan2( X[0,2], X[0,0] ) where X = (R_armᵀ·R_des)·R_tcpᵀ (recall that an ideal rotation about Y has the form [[cos,0,sin],[0,1,0],[-sin,0,cos]]). One acceptable complete solution is given below.

    """
    Computes a closed‐form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of the 6-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    The overall transformation is factorized as:
      R_total = Rz(q1) · Ry(q2+q3+q4) · Rz(q5) · [Ry(q6)· R_tcp]
    with the fixed wrist (TCP) transform
       T_tcp = (R_tcp, [0,0.0823,0])
    where R_tcp = Rz(1.570796325).
    
    The solution is obtained in two stages. First, using the structure of the 5–DOF arm (joints 1–5)
    the joint angles q1 … q5 are computed so that the desired TCP position “minus” the wrist offset from
    joint5 is reached. (Here the only position offset used is the translation from joint5 to joint6: 0.09465.)
    Then the residual orientation (the wrist “error”) is given by
         R_wrist = R_arm^T·R_des,
         where R_arm = Rz(q1)·Ry(q2+q3+q4)·Rz(q5) and
               R_des = Rz(yaw)*Ry(pitch)*Rx(roll)
    and since R_wrist = Ry(q6)·R_tcp, one recovers q6.
    
    This implementation assumes that the provided TCP target (p,r) is reachable.

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanatory notes:
1. The method first “rotates away” q1 by applying Rz(–q1) to both the target position p and target rotation R_des.
2. The decoupled “planar” problem is solved (for joints 2–4) by subtracting the known wrist offset L_wrist along the direction defined by φ = q2+q3+q4.
3. Once q1–q5 are computed (driving the wrist center to the correct position), the leftover wrist orientation is corrected by q6.
4. In particular, the residual rotation X = (R_armᵀ·R_des)·R_tcpᵀ contains only a rotation about Y, allowing extraction of q6.

This complete solution meets the task requirements.
