    Computes a closed‐form inverse kinematics solution for a 6 DOF serial manipulator.
    
    The manipulator has the following structure:
      - Joint 1 rotates about Z at the base.
      - Joints 2 and 3 (both about Y) form a planar 2-link “arm”.
          • Link 2 is offset from the base by [0, 0.13585, 0].
          • The “shoulder” for the planar solution is effectively at
            [0, (0.13585 - 0.1197), 0] = [0, 0.01615, 0] in the base frame.
          • The two links (in the shoulder’s x–z plane) have lengths:
                A = 0.425 (from shoulder to elbow)
                B = 0.39225 (from elbow to wrist center)
      - Joints 4, 5, and 6 form a spherical wrist.
        The TCP offset relative to joint 6 is defined by:
          • Translation: [0, 0.0823, 0]
          • Fixed rotation (rpy): [0, 0, 1.570796325]
        Based on forward kinematics analysis, the effective TCP offset in joint6’s frame 
        is taken as d_tcp = [0, 0, 0.0823].
    
    The procedure is:
      1. Compute the wrist center (p_wc) by subtracting the TCP offset (expressed in the target frame)
         from the target TCP position.
      2. Determine q1 (rotation about Z) by requiring that, when p_wc is rotated into the frame of joint2,
         its offset along the Y–axis equals the known shoulder offset (d_shoulder = 0.13585 – 0.1197 = 0.01615).
      3. Transform p_wc into the shoulder frame and solve the 2‐link planar problem (in the x–z plane)
         to determine q2 and q3. In this formulation the “shoulder” is at [0, d_shoulder, 0] in joint2’s frame.
         Note: There are two possible solutions (elbow “up” and “down”). Here we choose a branch based on 
         the sign of the x–coordinate in the shoulder frame:
           • If x >= 0: use q3 = π – temp and q2 = φ – β.
           • If x < 0:  use q3 = temp – π and q2 = φ + β.
         where 
             D = sqrt(x²+z²) is the planar distance from the shoulder to the wrist center,
             temp = acos( clamp((D² - A² - B²) / (2*A*B) ) ),
             φ = atan2(x, z),
             and β = atan2( B*sin(temp), A - B*cos(temp) ).
      4. Compute R_0_3 = Rz(q1) · Ry(q2+q3).
      5. Find the wrist rotation matrix R_w from:
             R_w = (R_0_3)ᵀ · R_target · (R_tcp_fixed)ᵀ,
         where R_target is built from the target Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw) using 
         the convention R_target = Rz(yaw) · Ry(pitch) · Rx(roll) and 
         R_tcp_fixed = Rz(1.570796325).
      6. Finally, extract the wrist angles q4, q5, and q6 from R_w using:
             q5 = atan2( sqrt(R_w[0,1]² + R_w[2,1]²), R_w[1,1] )
             q6 = atan2( R_w[1,2], R_w[1,0] )
             q4 = atan2( R_w[2,1], -R_w[0,1] )
    
    Returns:
      A tuple (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6) of the joint angles (in radians).
