We can ‚Äúdecouple‚Äù the problem by first computing the base (joint‚ÄØ1) angle so that the TCP is ‚Äúbrought‚Äù into a 2D plane. In our case the base joint rotates about Y so that if

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉq‚ÇÅ = atan2(x, z)

then, defining the rotated (local) coordinates by

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉp‚Ä≤ = [cos(q‚ÇÅ)*x ‚Äì sin(q‚ÇÅ)*z, y, sin(q‚ÇÅ)*x + cos(q‚ÇÅ)*z]

we note that p‚Ä≤ will have p‚Ä≤‚Çì = 0 and p‚Ä≤ùìè = ‚àö(x¬≤ + z¬≤). Next, in the manipulator the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù fixed offset (from the base to joint‚ÄØ2) is given by A = [0, ‚Äì0.1197, 0.425] (taken from Revolute‚ÄØ2‚Äôs ‚ÄúPosition‚Äù) so that if we define

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉp_eff = p‚Ä≤ ‚Äì A = [0, y + 0.1197, ‚àö(x¬≤ + z¬≤) ‚Äì 0.425],

then (for a reachable target) the y‚Äìcomponent must equal 0.093 (since the subsequent fixed translation from joint‚ÄØ3 to joint‚ÄØ4 is [0, 0.093, 0]). (In other words, the construction of the robot ‚Äúbuilds in‚Äù this TCP height.)

In the remaining 2D (y‚Äìz) ‚Äúarm‚Äù chain the moving links are:
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ a ‚Äúforearm‚Äù of length L‚ÇÅ = 0.39225 (from Revolute‚ÄØ2 to Revolute‚ÄØ3) and 
‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ a ‚Äúwrist‚Äù (TCP offset) of length L‚ÇÇ = 0.09465 (from joint 4 to the TCP),
while the effect of joint 4 is ‚Äúlost‚Äù in position. (We can set joint 4 to zero.)  

Working in the plane we note that after joint‚Äâ2 the result of the following two transformations is  
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉF = [L‚ÇÇ¬∑sin(q‚ÇÉ), 0.093, L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ¬∑cos(q‚ÇÉ)]
and then a rotation by q‚ÇÇ about Y maps F to
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉR_y(q‚ÇÇ)F = [cos(q‚ÇÇ)¬∑(L‚ÇÇ¬∑sin(q‚ÇÉ)) + sin(q‚ÇÇ)¬∑(L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ¬∑cos(q‚ÇÉ)), 0.093,
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Äì sin(q‚ÇÇ)¬∑(L‚ÇÇ¬∑sin(q‚ÇÉ)) + cos(q‚ÇÇ)¬∑(L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ¬∑cos(q‚ÇÉ))].
For the TCP to lie in the ‚Äúarm‚Äìplane‚Äù we must have the x‚Äìcomponent of R_y(q‚ÇÇ)F equal to zero; that condition forces
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉtan(q‚ÇÇ) = ‚Äì (L‚ÇÇ sin(q‚ÇÉ))/(L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ cos(q‚ÇÉ)).
On the other hand, equating the z‚Äìcomponent of R_y(q‚ÇÇ)F with the effective z‚Äìdistance p‚Ä≤ùìè ‚Äì 0.425 (i.e. p_effùìè) leads (after some algebra) to the cosine law relation
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚àö(L‚ÇÅ¬≤ + 2 L‚ÇÅ L‚ÇÇ cos(q‚ÇÉ) + L‚ÇÇ¬≤) = p_effùìè.
That is, 
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉcos(q‚ÇÉ) = (p_effùìè¬≤ ‚Äì L‚ÇÅ¬≤ ‚Äì L‚ÇÇ¬≤)/(2 L‚ÇÅ L‚ÇÇ).

A simple closed‚Äìform solution is then to:
‚ÄÉ1. Compute q‚ÇÅ = atan2(x, z).
‚ÄÉ2. Compute r = ‚àö(x¬≤ + z¬≤) so that p‚Ä≤ = [0, y, r] and then set
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉp_eff = [0, y + 0.1197, r ‚Äì 0.425].
‚ÄÉ3. (For a reachable target the y‚Äìcomponent must satisfy y + 0.1197 = 0.093.)
‚ÄÉ4. Set L‚ÇÅ = 0.39225 and L‚ÇÇ = 0.09465 and solve
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉcos(q‚ÇÉ) = ( (r ‚Äì 0.425)¬≤ ‚Äì L‚ÇÅ¬≤ ‚Äì L‚ÇÇ¬≤ )/(2 L‚ÇÅ L‚ÇÇ)
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉq‚ÇÉ = acos( cos(q‚ÇÉ) ).
‚ÄÉ5. Then, with 
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉtan(q‚ÇÇ) = ‚Äì (L‚ÇÇ sin(q‚ÇÉ))/(L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ cos(q‚ÇÉ)),
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉq‚ÇÇ = atan2( ‚Äì L‚ÇÇ sin(q‚ÇÉ), L‚ÇÅ + L‚ÇÇ cos(q‚ÇÉ) ).
‚ÄÉ6. And choose q‚ÇÑ = 0.

Below is one complete implementation of the analytical inverse‚Äìkinematics method. (Note: we assume that the input ‚Äúp‚Äù is reachable, so no extra checks are made.)

Explanation:

1. We first compute q1 so that a rotation by ‚Äìq1 (about Y) aligns the TCP onto the plane where x‚Ä≤ = 0 and z‚Ä≤ = ‚àö(x¬≤+z¬≤).
2. The fixed offset A = [0, ‚Äì0.1197, 0.425] (from revolute 1 to revolute 2) is subtracted so that p_eff = [0, y+0.1197, ‚àö(x¬≤+z¬≤)-0.425]. (In the forward chain the y‚Äìcomponent becomes ‚Äì0.0267; note that ‚Äì0.0267 + 0.1197 = 0.093, which is ‚Äúbuilt into‚Äù the mechanism.)
3. With L1 and L2 representing the remaining ‚Äúreach‚Äù in the z‚Äìdirection, applying the cosine law gives q3 and then the condition that the x‚Äìcomponent vanish yields q2.
4. Lastly, we set q4 = 0.

This closed‚Äìform solution uses basic trigonometry and the cosine law to compute the joint angles required to place the TCP (assuming the target is reachable).
