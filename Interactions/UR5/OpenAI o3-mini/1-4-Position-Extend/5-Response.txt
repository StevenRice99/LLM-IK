def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Computes a closed-form analytical solution for the inverse kinematics of a 4-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    The chain is defined as follows:
      • Revolute 1 (axis Y) is at the base, at [0, 0, 0].
      • A fixed translation [0, -0.1197, 0.425] is applied.
      • Revolute 2 (axis Y) rotates.
      • A fixed translation [0, 0, 0.39225] is applied.
      • Revolute 3 (axis Y) rotates.
      • A fixed translation [0, 0.093, 0] is applied.
      • Revolute 4 (axis Z) rotates.
      • A fixed translation [0, 0, 0.09465] positions the TCP.
    
    Notably, the only translations that affect the TCP position in the x-z plane are:
      - 0.425 (from the [0, -0.1197, 0.425] translation) and 
      - 0.39225 + 0.09465 = 0.4869 (the sum of the translations along z after the second and fourth links).
    
    Additionally, note that the y-coordinate is fixed as:
         y = -0.1197 + 0.093 = -0.0267.
    
    Thus, if the target TCP position p = [x, y, z] is valid, then y should equal -0.0267 and the 
    effective planar problem reduces to a 2R arm in the x-z plane with link lengths:
         a = 0.425,
         b = 0.4869.
    
    The solution involves:
      1. Computing r = sqrt(x^2 + z^2), the distance in the horizontal plane.
      2. Using the cosine law:
             cos(theta2) = (r^2 - a^2 - b^2) / (2ab)
         to obtain an effective inner joint angle theta2_eff.
      3. Adjusting the sign of theta2_eff with a cross-product test:
             cross = x*(a + b*cos(theta2_eff)) - z*(b*sin(theta2_eff))
         If cross < 0, set theta2_eff to its negative.
      4. Computing an offset angle phi = atan2(b*sin(theta2_eff), a + b*cos(theta2_eff)).
      5. Determining theta1 as the difference between the direction to the target (psi = atan2(x, z))
         and phi:    theta1 = psi - phi.
      6. Joints 3 and 4 do not affect the TCP position, so we set theta3 and theta4 to 0.
    
    :param p: A tuple [x, y, z] representing the target TCP position.
              For a valid solution, p[1] should be -0.0267.
    :return: A tuple (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4) representing the joint angles in radians.
