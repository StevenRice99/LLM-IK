    """
    Analytical closed–form inverse kinematics for a 5-DOF serial manipulator.
    
    Robot chain (all lengths in meters) and fixed translations come from:
      • Joint1 (revolute about Y) at origin.
      • Translation to Joint2: [0, -0.1197, 0.425]
      • Joint2: revolute about Y.
      • Translation to Joint3: [0, 0, 0.39225]
      • Joint3: revolute about Y.
      • Translation to Joint4: [0, 0.093, 0]
      • Joint4: revolute about Z.
      • Translation to Joint5: [0, 0, 0.09465]
      • Joint5: revolute about Y.
      • Translation to TCP: [0, 0.0823, 0]
    
    In this formulation, only joints 1-3 and joint4 affect the TCP position.
    In particular, when one derives the forward kinematics the TCP coordinates (x, y, z)
    come out as follows:
      S = q1 + q2 + q3   (sum of the three Y–axis rotations)
      x = L1 * sin(q1) + L2 * sin(q1+q2) + L3 * sin(S) - 0.0823 * sin(q4) * cos(S)
      z = L1 * cos(q1) + L2 * cos(q1+q2) + L3 * cos(S) + 0.0823 * sin(q4) * sin(S)
      y = -0.1197 + 0 + 0.093 + 0.0823*cos(q4)
        = -0.0267 + 0.0823*cos(q4)
    where
      L1 = 0.425      (translation along z in joint2)
      L2 = 0.39225    (translation along z in joint3)
      L3 = 0.09465    (translation along z from joint5 to TCP)
      
    The key observation is that the vertical (y) coordinate depends only on q4:
         y = -0.0267 + 0.0823*cos(q4)
    so we can solve for q4 immediately from the target y.
    Then, substituting d = 0.0823*sin(q4), one can show that the x and z equations become:
         x = P + L_eff * sin(T)
         z = Q + L_eff * cos(T)
    where
         P = L1*sin(q1) + L2*sin(q1+q2)
         Q = L1*cos(q1) + L2*cos(q1+q2)
         L_eff = sqrt(L3**2 + d**2)
         φ = atan2(d, L3)
         T = S - φ   with S = q1+q2+q3.
    A natural candidate for T is obtained from the target horizontal direction.
    Let ψ = atan2(x, z). Then one may set a candidate T = ψ (or ψ + π),
    and hence S = T + φ.
    Finally, the remaining 2R-subchain (joints 1 and 2) must produce a wrist center W,
    defined by:
         W = [ x - L_eff*sin(T),  z - L_eff*cos(T) ]
    The 2R IK yields q1 and q2 (with two solutions) and then q3 = S – (q1+q2).
    Joint5 is redundant for position, so we set it to zero.
    
    This function searches over the candidate branches for q4 (the two solutions
    from the y–equation) and for T (using ψ and ψ+π) and for the two possible
    2R IK solutions, then returns the candidate whose forward kinematics best
    matches the target.
    
    :param p: The target TCP position as (x, y, z).
              Note: p must be reachable. (y is not forced to a single value.)
    :return: A tuple (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5) in radians.
