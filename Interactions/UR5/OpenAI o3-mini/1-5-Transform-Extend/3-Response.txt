Below is one valid closed‐form solution. In our approach we “decouple” the five‑joint chain by first “backing off” the constant tool offset so that the “wrist” (joint‑5 origin) is computed from

  p_wrist = p_TCP – [0, 0.0823, 0].

Because the subchain from joints 1–3 (with effective “links” of 0.425 and 0.39225 plus the fixed translation of 0.09465 from joint‐5) lies almost entirely in the x–z plane, we proceed as follows. First we compute the target’s rotation R_target (from provided roll–pitch–yaw) and then define

  theta_sum = atan2(R_target[0,2], R_target[2,2]),

which will be the sum of joints 1–3. In the position equations the (constant) translation from joint‐5 back to joint‐4 is “subtracted” along this direction. (In our notation the length C_tcp = 0.09465.) Then by “solving” the two–link planar geometry we find θ₁, θ₂ and set θ₃ = theta_sum – θ₁ – θ₂. Finally, noting that the complete chain has a fixed TCP rotation R_fixed = R_z(1.570796325) (so that FORWARD_KINEMATICS(0,0,0,0,0) gives the expected TCP orientation) the remaining two joints must satisfy

  R_target = R_y(theta₁+theta₂+theta₃) · R_z(theta₄) · R_y(theta₅) · R_fixed.

We then “remove” the fixed tool rotation and the already‐determined Y–rotation (computed by R_y(theta₁+…+theta₃)) so that

  R_y(theta₁+…+theta₃)ᵀ · [R_target · R_z(–1.570796325)] = R_z(theta₄) · R_y(theta₅).

Because the product R_z(theta₄)·R_y(theta₅) has the form

  [[cosθ₄ cosθ₅, –sinθ₄, cosθ₄ sinθ₅],
   [sinθ₄ cosθ₅,  cosθ₄, sinθ₄ sinθ₅],
   [ –sinθ₅,         0,      cosθ₅]],

we can read off

  θ₅ = –arcsin( (R_bar)[2,0] )
  θ₄ = atan2( (R_bar)[1,0], (R_bar)[0,0] ).

The complete Python function is given below.

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. We first compute R_target (from the given rpy) and “back‐off” the tool’s constant offset in position (0, 0.0823, 0) so that p_wrist = p – [0,0.0823,0] is the origin of joint 5.

2. The effective approach direction (theta_sum) is obtained from the elements of R_target; then subtracting the fixed link-5 translation (C_tcp = 0.09465) along that direction yields an (x,z) pair (x_eff,z_eff) that the “arm” (joints 1–3) must reach. Using the two–link geometry (with lengths 0.425 and 0.39225) the angles θ₁ and θ₂ are solved and θ₃ set so that θ₁+θ₂+θ₃ = theta_sum.

3. Finally, after “removing” the fixed TCP rotation R_tcp_fixed from R_target and “undoing” the arm’s Y–rotation R_y(theta_sum), the remaining product equals R_z(θ₄)·R_y(θ₅) from which θ₅ and θ₄ are recovered.

In the zero configuration (p = [0, 0.0556, 0.9119] with r = [0, 0, 1.570796325]), this method returns (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) so that FORWARD_KINEMATICS(0,0,0,0,0) yields the expected TCP pose.

Any solution meeting the given specifications is acceptable.
