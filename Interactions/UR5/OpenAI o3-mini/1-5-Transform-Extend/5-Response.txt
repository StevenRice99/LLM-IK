The forward kinematics output shows that when all joint angles are set to 0 the resulting TCP pose is

  Position: [0, 0.0556, 0.9119]
  Orientation: [0, 0, 1.570796325]

which matches the expected configuration. 

In our closed‐form inverse kinematics solution, when given this target TCP pose and orientation, the computed joint values are (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) – ensuring that FORWARD_KINEMATICS(0,0,0,0,0) produces the table of poses exactly as demonstrated.
