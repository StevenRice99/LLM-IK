The solution is consistent with the FK output. For example, when the TCP target is p = [0, 0.0556, 0.9119] with r = [0, 0, 1.570796325], our closed‐form inverse kinematics (with all computed joint angles equal to 0) yields

  (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, θ₄, θ₅) = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

which indeed gives a TCP pose with Position = [0, 0.0556, 0.9119] and Orientation = [0, 0, 1.570796325] when evaluated with the forward kinematics.
