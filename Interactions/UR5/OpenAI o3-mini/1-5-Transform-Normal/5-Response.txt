We can derive a (closed‐form) solution by “decoupling” the arm position (joints 1–3) from the wrist orientation (joints 4–5). One acceptable answer is as follows. In our derivation we note that (with all angles in radians):

• The TCP’s fixed origin (TCP link) is given by a translation of d₂ = 0.0823 along y (in the wrist frame) plus a fixed rotation Rz(1.570796325). Hence the TCP y–component (in the base) obeys

  p_y = –0.0267 + d₂·cos(θ₄).

Thus we immediately get

  θ₄ = arccos((p_y + 0.0267)/d₂).

• Next, note that if we “remove” the wrist’s offset from the desired TCP position then the wrist‐center (i.e. the origin of joint 5) is

  p_wc = [ pₓ + d₂·sin(θ₄)·cos(ψ),
        p_y – d₂·cos(θ₄),
        p_z – d₂·sin(θ₄)·sin(ψ) ],

where ψ = (θ₁+θ₂+θ₃) is the net rotation from joints 1–3. (Because joints 1, 2 and 3 all rotate about y the “arm plane” is determined by ψ; note that when all joint angles vanish the FK shows ψ = 0.) A natural “decoupling” (and one acceptable choice) is to set

  ψ = arctan2(pₓ, p_z).

Now, the first three joints produce the wrist–center via the chain

  p_wc = Q + d₃·[sin ψ, 0, cos ψ],

with d₃ = 0.09465 and where Q is the effective “2‐R result” from links 1 and 2. In particular, writing

  Q = [0.425·sin(θ₁) + 0.39225·sin(θ₁+θ₂),
      …           –0.0267,        
     0.425·cos(θ₁) + 0.39225·cos(θ₁+θ₂) ],

we equate the x– and z–components with

  Q = [ pₓ + d₂·sin(θ₄)·cos(ψ) – d₃·sin(ψ),
      p_z – d₂·sin(θ₄)·sin(ψ) – d₃·cos(ψ) ].

Then (letting Qₓ and Q_z denote the right–hand side components and letting r = √(Qₓ²+Q_z²)) the standard planar “2R–IK” gives

  θ₂′ = arccos( (r² – 0.425² – 0.39225²)/(2·0.425·0.39225) ),
   φ = arctan2(Qₓ, Q_z),
   δ = arctan2(0.39225·sin(θ₂′), 0.425 + 0.39225·cos(θ₂′) ),
   θ₁ = φ – δ,
   θ₂ = θ₂′                   (choose “elbow–down”)
   θ₃ = ψ – (θ₁+θ₂).

• Finally, the overall TCP rotation is given by

  R_TCP = Ry(ψ) · Rz(θ₄) · Ry(θ₅) · Rz(1.570796325).

Thus, after we compute a desired rotation matrix R_des (from the given rpy r – here we use the convention R = Rz(yaw)·Ry(pitch)·Rx(roll)) we “remove” the contribution from joints 1–3 and joint 4 by setting

  A = Ry(ψ) · Rz(θ₄)
  B = Aᵀ · R_des · Rz(–1.570796325).

Since B = Ry(θ₅) its (0,0) and (0,2) entries satisfy B[0,0] = cos(θ₅) and B[0,2] = sin(θ₅); hence

  θ₅ = arctan2(B[0,2], B[0,0]).

One acceptable answer is therefore to complete the inverse_kinematics method as shown below. (Any solution that returns joint values solving

  joint1 = θ₁, joint2 = θ₂, joint3 = θ₃, joint4 = θ₄, joint5 = θ₅

and that satisfies the above equations is acceptable.)

Below is one complete Python solution (using numpy) implementing the above steps:

Note the following:
1. In the solution above the “net” rotation ψ of joints 1–3 is chosen as the arctan of the TCP’s x and z coordinates. (Other choices are possible; any set of values that yields the same TCP position and that, after solving for joint 5 from the orientation constraint, gives a valid solution is acceptable.)
2. The 2R–IK is standard: with Q = [Qx, Qz] one has
  θ₂ = arccos((r²–L1²–L2²)/(2·L1·L2))
  θ₁ = arctan2(Qx, Qz) – arctan2(L2·sinθ₂, L1 + L2·cosθ₂)
and then θ₃ = ψ – (θ₁+θ₂).
3. In the orientation part we use the fixed TCP rotation Rz(1.570796325) as given in the URDF.

Any solution that returns joint angles (θ₁, …, θ₅) satisfying the same equations is acceptable. (No “testing‐code” is provided here.)
