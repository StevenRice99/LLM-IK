    """
    Computes a closed‐form analytical inverse kinematics solution for a 5‐DOF manipulator.
    
    The manipulator’s kinematics (all units in meters and angles in radians) are defined by:
      • Revolute 1: origin [0, 0, 0], axis Y.
      • Revolute 2: origin [0, -0.1197, 0.425], axis Y.
      • Revolute 3: origin [0, 0, 0.39225], axis Y.
      • Revolute 4: origin [0, 0.093, 0], axis Z.
      • Revolute 5: origin [0, 0, 0.09465], axis Y.
      • TCP: origin [0, 0.0823, 0] with a fixed rotation Rz(1.570796325).
      
    In this solution the IK is “decoupled” into an arm (joints 1–3) and a wrist (joints 4–5).
    (Note: for a 5‐DOF arm only two independent translational dimensions can be controlled;
     the extra joint is “redundant” and here we assign it to resolve the wrist orientation.)
     
    The solution proceeds as follows:
      1. First the desired TCP rotation R_des is computed from the given rpy (using the
         convention R = Rz(yaw)·Ry(pitch)·Rx(roll)).
      2. A “virtual” arm rotation about Y (which in our chain is the cumulative rotation from joints 1–3)
         is extracted from R_des. Since a pure rotation about Y has the form:
               Ry(ψ) = [[ cosψ, 0, sinψ],
                        [    0, 1,    0],
                        [-sinψ, 0, cosψ]],
         we choose:
               ψ = arctan2( R_des[0,2], R_des[2,2] ).
      3. The wrist “offset” from the TCP is removed. (It is standard in IK to “subtract off” the fixed
         tool transform; here we assume the TCP’s translation is defined in its own (tool) frame.)
         Thus, the wrist center is set to:
               p_wc = p – (R_des · [0, 0.0823, 0])
      4. The y–coordinate of the wrist center is constrained by the fact that joints 2 and 4 contribute a
         fixed vertical offset. In our chain the net offset is:
               y_wrist = (–0.1197 [from link 2] + 0.093 [from link 4]) = –0.0267.
         Then the wrist offset along Y (of magnitude 0.0823) is “resolved” by joint 4 via:
               p_y = (–0.0267) + 0.0823·cos(q4)
         so that
               q4 = arccos((p[1] – (–0.0267)) / 0.0823).
      5. For the arm (joints 1–3) we assume that (by design) only x and z are “assigned” by these joints.
         In our model the forward kinematics of the “arm” (ignoring the wrist’s rotations) yield:
           TCP_x = 0.425·sin(q1) + 0.39225·sin(q1+q2)   and
           TCP_z = 0.425·cos(q1) + 0.39225·cos(q1+q2) + 0.09465.
         We set these equal to the corresponding components of our wrist‐center p_wc.
         (This “planar 2R” IK is computed as follows.)
      6. Define:
             X = p_wc[0]   and   Z = p_wc[2] – 0.09465.
         Then, with
             r = sqrt(X² + Z²),
         the law of cosines gives
             cos(q2) = (r² – 0.425² – 0.39225²) / (2 · 0.425 · 0.39225).
         To be consistent with the “elbow‐down” solution, we choose
             q2 = – arccos( cos(q2) ).
         Also, with
             φ = arctan2(X, Z)
         and
             δ = arctan2( 0.39225·sin(|q2|), 0.425 + 0.39225·cos(|q2|) ),
         we set
             q1 = φ – δ.
      7. The free parameter q3 is then “used up” to achieve the overall arm rotation:
             q3 = ψ – (q1 + q2).
      8. Finally, the wrist orientation is imposed. Noting that the total TCP rotation is given by:
             R_TCP = R_y(ψ) · Rz(q4) · R_y(q5) · Rz(1.570796325)
         we isolate q5 by letting
             A = R_y(ψ) · Rz(q4)
             B = Aᵀ · R_des · Rz(–1.570796325)
         so that B = R_y(q5) and hence
             q5 = arctan2(B[0,2], B[0,0]).
    
    Any solution yielding joint angles (q1, q2, q3, q4, q5) that satisfy these equations is acceptable.
    This implementation (using NumPy) is one acceptable closed‐form solution.

Explanation:

1. The code first computes R_des from the desired rpy orientation.
2. It “extracts” ψ—the net rotation about Y that the first three joints must provide—by reading the (0,2) and (2,2) elements of R_des.
3. Joint 4 is set from the y–coordinate equation (using the fixed offset from joints 2 and 4).
4. The wrist center (the effective TCP position without the fixed tool offset) is found by subtracting R_des applied to [0, tcp_offset, 0].
5. A standard “planar 2R” solution (with link lengths L1 and L2) is then used to solve for q1 and q2 from the x and z components of the wrist center (after discounting the d3 offset).
6. Joint 3 “absorbs” any remaining rotation needed so that the arm’s cumulative rotation equals ψ.
7. Finally, the wrist joint q5 is recovered by “removing” the known rotations from the desired TCP orientation.

Any solution that meets the above decoupling (and returns joint values q1 … q5 satisfying the TCP’s position and orientation) is acceptable.

Note:
Because of the manipulator’s limited DOF and the chosen decoupling, there exists redundancy; different valid choices are possible. This solution (which uses ψ = arctan2(R_des[0,2], R_des[2,2])) is one acceptable closed–form inverse kinematics method.
