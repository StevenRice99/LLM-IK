Below is one acceptable complete solution. In our approach the y‐coordinate of the TCP (which is invariant under rotations about Y) immediately gives a closed–form relation for joint 3. (Because the TCP is offset by 0.0823 in y from the last revolute joint whose axis is Y, the only y–motion comes from joint 3’s cosine.) Then, by writing the combined “planar” (x,z) portion of the chain as a rotated 2R–chain we can use law–of–cosines style algebra to solve for joint 2 (up to a two–fold choice) and then “back out” joint 1 from the remaining (x,z) equation. (Joint 4 is “redundant” for pure position and we choose it to be zero.) 

To explain briefly, note that the forward chain (using the URDF “origins”) is  
  TCP = R_y(q1) · { T_z(0.39225) · R_y(q2) · [ T_y(0.093) · R_z(q3) · (T_z(0.09465) · R_y(q4) · T_y(0.0823)) ] }  
and because both T_y translations are invariant to rotations about Y, the TCP y–coordinate obeys

  p_y = 0.0823·cos(q3) + 0.093             (1)

so that  
  q3 = arccos((p_y – 0.093)/0.0823).

Next the (x,z) part of the chain (after “removing” the known 0.39225 offset along z) can be written in closed–form in terms of
  A = –0.0823·cos(q2)·sin(q3) + 0.09465·sin(q2)
  B = 0.0823·sin(q2)·sin(q3) + 0.09465·cos(q2) + 0.39225.
In fact, one obtains
  p_x = cos(q1)·A + sin(q1)·B     (2)
  p_z = –sin(q1)·A + cos(q1)·B    (3)
so that the “planar length” D = √(p_x²+p_z²) must satisfy  
  A²+B² = D².

A short algebraic manipulation shows that A²+B² = a₁²+a₂² + 2d·(a₁·cos(q2)+a₂·sin(q2)) + d²  
(with a₁ = 0.09465, a₂ = 0.0823·sin(q3), d = 0.39225). Hence one may solve for q2 via  
  a₁·cos(q2) + a₂·sin(q2) = K   with K = (D² – (a₁²+a₂²+d²))/(2d).
Writing the left–side as R·cos(q2–α) (with R = √(a₁²+a₂²) and α = atan2(a₂,a₁)) then yields  
  q2 = α ± arccos(K/R).  
In our solution we choose the “+” branch (which for our test case recovers the forward kinematics within rounding), and finally q1 is recovered uniquely from (2) and (3) by noticing that a little algebra shows

  q1 = atan2(p_x·B – A·p_z, B·p_z + A·p_x).

Since joint 4 does not effect the position (because its TCP offset T_y(0.0823) is invariant under rotation about Y), we set q4 = 0.

Below is the complete Python function implementing these steps. (Any complete closed–form solution that produces joint values satisfying f(q1,q2,q3,q4) = p is acceptable.)

--------------------------------------------------

This solution uses the steps described:
1. Solve for q3 from the TCP y-coordinate.
2. Write the (x,z) portion of the problem as a 2–R subchain and solve for q2 using an algebraic “cosine law.”
3. Recover q1 from the rotated (x,z) equations.
4. Set q4 = 0.

Any correct closed–form solution is acceptable.
