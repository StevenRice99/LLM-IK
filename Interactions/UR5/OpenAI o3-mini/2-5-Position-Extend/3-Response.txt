Below is one acceptable closed‐form solution. In our solution the key observation is that the only “active” translations affecting the TCP’s x–z position come from the two links whose lengths (0.39225 and 0.09465) lie along the z‐axis of the rotated frames (with the two y‐offsets, 0.093 and 0.0823, fixed so that the TCP always lies at y = 0.1753). In other words, when you write the forward kinematics the x–z coordinates of the TCP are given by

  x = 0.39225 · sin(θ₁) + 0.09465 · sin(θ₁ + θ₂)  
  z = 0.39225 · cos(θ₁) + 0.09465 · cos(θ₁ + θ₂)

so that a standard two‐link (planar) inverse solution (using the law‐of‐cosines) may be applied to recover θ₁ and θ₂. (Note that the provided "EXISTING" method solved a similar sub–chain assuming the TCP was located at the end of the second “arm” and set the angle of the intervening revolute joint about the sub–chain’s out–of–plane axis to zero.) Since neither the translation from joint₃ (0,0.093,0) nor the TCP’s offset (0, 0.0823, 0) affect the x–z coordinates the remaining two joints (revolute 3 and revolute 4) are “free” from a positional standpoint. In our solution we choose θ₃ = 0 and, since joint₄ rotates about Y (and the TCP’s offset is along Y so isn’t changed by a Y–rotation), we simply choose θ₄ = 0.

One acceptable implementation is as follows:

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" (i.e. the TCP position).
    
    The robot has four revolute joints. The first two joints (with axes Y) determine the
    x–z placement of the TCP according to
       x = 0.39225*sin(theta1) + 0.09465*sin(theta1+theta2)
       z = 0.39225*cos(theta1) + 0.09465*cos(theta1+theta2)
    while the remaining joints (joint 3 about Z and joint 4 about Y) only affect the TCP’s orientation.
    Since the fixed y offsets (0.093 from joint 3 and 0.0823 from the TCP) guarantee that y = 0.1753 for
    any valid solution, we use the standard 2R inverse kinematics to compute theta1 and theta2
    and then set theta3 and theta4 to zero.

-------------------------------------------------

In the example provided above, if one applies the forward kinematics with
  joint1 = 1.0, joint2 = 0.5, joint3 = 0.0, joint4 = 0.0,
then the TCP is computed as
  [0.42448, 0.1753, 0.21863],
so that calling inverse_kinematics([0.42448, 0.1753, 0.21863])
will recover the joint values (approximately 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.0).

This solution meets the problem requirements, providing a closed-form analytical inverse kinematics method using only standard Python math functions.
