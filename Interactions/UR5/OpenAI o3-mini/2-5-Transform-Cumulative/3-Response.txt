We can solve the full 4‐DOF inverse kinematics by “decoupling” the position and orientation. In our solution the first three joints (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃) are “back‐solved” from the x–z position and (part of) the desired end‐effector orientation, while the final joint (θ₄) is computed from the “wrist” (the joints 1–3 rotation) and the fixed TCP rotation (which in our case is a constant rotation about Z by 1.570796325). One acceptable closed‐form solution is as follows. (In our notation the constant link offsets are defined as extracted from the URDF: note that the translation [0,0,0.09465] on joint 4 is “subtracted” from the target x–z position before solving for θ₁ and θ₂ and the TCP fixed rotation R_tcpₒᶠᶠ is given by R_z(1.570796325).)

Below is one correct implementation. (It uses the same order for the TCP “roll–pitch–yaw” as the provided EXISTING codes.)

    """
    Gets the joint values (θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, θ₄) needed to reach a TCP with position p and orientation r.
    
    The robot’s chain is assumed as follows:
      • Joint 1 (revolute about Y) at the base.
      • Joint 2 (revolute about Y) following a translation along Z of 0.39225.
      • Joint 3 (revolute about Z) following a translation [0, 0.093, 0].
      • Joint 4 (revolute about Y) following a translation along Z of 0.09465.
      • Finally the TCP is attached (translated by [0,0.0823,0] and rotated by Rz(1.570796325)).
      
    In our solution the x–z target (p[0] and p[2]) is “corrected” by subtracting the link4 translation (L4 = 0.09465)
    (which effectively is the offset coming from the fact that joint4’s translation is along the (rotated) z‐axis),
    so that the summed (θ₁+θ₂) “direction” (which is recovered from the target’s z–axis components of R_target)
    gives the desired solution for joints 1 and 2. Joint 3 is extracted from the target’s (1,0) and (1,1) elements.
    Finally the remaining rotation required at the wrist is computed by forming
      M = (R₀₁₂₃)ᵀ · R_target · (R_tcpₒᶠᶠ)ᵀ
    and noting that M should equal a rotation about Y by θ₄.

    #
    # In our previous sub-chain (see EXISTING 3) a solution is given by:
    theta3 = math.atan2(R_target[1, 0], R_target[1, 1])

    # ------------------------------
    # (4) Solve for joint 4 from the remaining rotation.
    #
    # Up to joint 3 the rotation is:
    #    R_0123 = R_y(θ₁) · R_y(θ₂) · R_z(θ₃)
    # Since rotations about Y add, we can write R_y(θ₁)*R_y(θ₂) = R_y(θ₁+θ₂).
    R_y12 = rot_y(theta1 + theta2)
    R_z3  = rot_z(theta3)
    R_0123 = R_y12 @ R_z3

    # The TCP end–effector has a fixed rotational offset: R_tcp_off = R_z(1.570796325).
    R_tcp_off = rot_z(1.570796325)

    # After joint 4 the rotation is R_total = R_0123 * R_y(θ₄) * R_tcp_off,
    # and we want R_total to equal R_target.
    # Rearranging, we get:
    #       R_y(θ₄) = (R_0123)ᵀ · R_target · (R_tcp_off)ᵀ.
    M = R_0123.T @ R_target @ R_tcp_off.T
    #
    # But since joint 4 rotates about Y its rotation matrix has the form:
    #       [ cosθ₄    0    sinθ₄ ]
    #       [   0      1      0    ]
    #       [ -sinθ₄   0    cosθ₄ ]
    # so we can extract θ₄ as:
    theta4 = math.atan2(M[0, 2], M[0, 0])

    return (theta1, theta2, theta3, theta4)

------------------------------------------------------------

How does this work? 
1. The target rotation R_target is built from the provided roll, pitch and yaw.
2. We “remove” the effect of the translation due to link 4 (of length 0.09465) from the x and z target coordinates, while the sum (θ₁+θ₂) is recovered from R_target.
3. Joint 3 is solved directly from the (1,0) and (1,1) elements of R_target.
4. Finally, after “removing” the rotation already provided by joints 1–3, the additional rotation needed about Y (which is provided in joint 4) is computed using a simple matching of the standard rotation–about–Y form.

This solution assumes all targets are reachable and (like the EXISTING codes) does not perform any reachability checks.
