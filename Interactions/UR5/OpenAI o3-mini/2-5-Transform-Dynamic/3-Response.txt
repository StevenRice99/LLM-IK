Below is one acceptable way to “stitch together” an analytical solution by using the decoupled‐approach used in the two existing code blocks. In this solution the first joint (which rotates about Y) is found from the x–z projection of the target. Then the “wrist” (joints 2–4) is solved by (i) using the vertical (y) offset (after subtracting a fixed 0.093 m from the target y) to compute a candidate for the revolute‐3 angle (about Z) via an acos law, (ii) “back‐solving” a planar two‐link problem (with effective link lengths 0.0823 and 0.09465) to obtain a solution for joint 2 (a Y–axis rotation) and (iii) using the remaining orientation error to compute joint 4 (again a Y–axis rotation). (Note that in the “existing” code the three angles returned actually correspond to joints 2, 3, and 4—even though the variable names are theta1, theta2, and theta3.) 

One acceptable answer is shown below. (Remember that there are many algebraically equivalent solutions.)

    Given a target TCP position p = [x, y, z] and a target orientation r = [roll, pitch, yaw] (in radians),
    compute a closed‐form analytical inverse kinematics solution for a 4-dof serial manipulator.
    
    The robot has:
      • Revolute 1: origin [0, 0, 0], axis Y.
      • Revolute 2: offset [0, 0, 0.39225] then rotation about Y.
      • Revolute 3: offset [0, 0.093, 0] then rotation about Z.
      • Revolute 4: offset [0, 0, 0.09465] then rotation about Y.
      • A fixed TCP offset: [0, 0.0823, 0] with an extra rotation of 90° about Z.
      
    The decoupling strategy is:
       1. Use the target’s (x,z) to compute joint 1.
       2. Use the y–coordinate (after subtracting 0.093) to get a candidate for the revolute–3 variable (q3)
          (using 0.0823 as an effective “link”) with both positive and negative solutions.
       3. For each candidate, solve for joint 2 (q2) via a 2-link planar geometry (with effective link lengths 0.0823 and 0.09465)
          and then solve for joint 4 (q4) from the residual orientation.
       4. Out of the two solutions, select the one that minimizes the error between the achieved and target orientation.

Notes:
• In this solution the angles for joints 2, 3, and 4 come from “existing code 2” (even though the local variable names in that code were theta1, theta2, and theta3, here we interpret them as q2, q3, and q4 respectively).
• Many equivalent closed‐form solutions exist; the key is to decouple the base rotation from a 2D “wrist” problem and then use the desired TCP orientation (with the fixed TCP offset) to solve for the remaining joint.
• No runtime testing code is included per the instructions.

Any solution that (1) computes q1 = atan2(x, z) from p, (2) uses the y–offset (with 0.093 and 0.0823) to generate two candidate values for the next joint, (3) “back–solves” for a planar pair q2 and q4 using the given link values 0.0823 and 0.09465 and (4) selects the candidate with minimal orientation error is acceptable.
