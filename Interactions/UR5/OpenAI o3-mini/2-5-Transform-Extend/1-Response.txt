Below is one acceptable closed‐form solution. In our approach we “decouple” position from orientation by first using the same idea as in the provided 3‑DOF sub‑chain to solve for θ₁, θ₂, and (what was previously called) θ₃ while “backing off” by the fixed translation along z from the revolute‑4 link (B = 0.09465, according to the table). Then we note that the complete forward kinematics yields

  R_total = R_y(θ₁) · R_y(θ₂) · R_z(θ₃) · R_y(θ₄) · R_z(1.570796325)

and so if the desired end‑effector rotation is R_target (computed from the given roll–pitch–yaw r), then one may “solve” for the fourth joint from

  R_y(θ₄) = (R_y(θ₁)·R_y(θ₂)·R_z(θ₃))⁻¹ · R_target · R_z(–1.570796325).

Because a rotation about y has the form

  R_y(θ) = [ [cosθ 0 sinθ],
       [  0   1    0 ],
       [–sinθ 0 cosθ] ],

one may extract θ₄ via

  θ₄ = atan2(R_temp[0,2], R_temp[2,2]),

with R_temp defined as above. (Note that the translation “offset” from joint 4 to TCP is applied as T_tcp = Trans([0, 0.0823, 0])·R_z(1.570796325) but its translation is along the y‑axis—so since the 3‑DOF sub–chain (which uses only x and z) was already solved from p = [x, y, z] (with y effectively determined by the fixed 0.093 from link 3) we assume here that the given target position already “incorporates” the TCP translation in the x–z plane.) 

One acceptable complete solution is shown below:

    Gets the joint values (in radians) for reaching TCP position p and orientation r.
    
    In our serial manipulator the joints are:
      • Revolute 1 about Y (origin at [0,0,0])
      • Revolute 2 about Y (with a fixed translation of 0.39225 along z)
      • Revolute 3 about Z (with a fixed translation of 0.093 along y)
      • Revolute 4 about Y (with a fixed translation of 0.09465 along z), and then
         a TCP fixed offset given by translation [0, 0.0823, 0] and a rotation about Z by 1.570796325.
    
    The provided 3 DOF solution (for joints 1–3) is used to “back off” the fixed offset B = 0.09465.
    We then compute the additional joint angle θ₄ so that the full forward kinematics

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:

1. We first build R_target from the given roll, pitch, and yaw.
2. For the “arm” (joints 1–3) we use the same method as in the existing code – note the use of B = 0.09465 (the fixed translation along z coming from link 4) when “backing off” the target in x and z.
3. Then, because the complete chain’s rotation is the product R_y(θ₁)·R_y(θ₂)·R_z(θ₃)·R_y(θ₄)·R_z(1.570796325), we “remove” (invert) the known contributions and the fixed TCP rotation R_z(1.570796325) to isolate R_y(θ₄). Finally, we extract θ₄ via atan2 from the (0,2) and (2,2) elements.

This solution is one acceptable analytical inverse kinematics for the given 4‑DOF manipulator.
