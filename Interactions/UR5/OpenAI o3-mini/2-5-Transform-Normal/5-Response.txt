Below is one acceptable complete solution. In our solution we first observe that—in our chosen frames—the TCP position (from T₁·T₂·T₃·T₄·T_tcp) may be written in closed‐form as

  pₓ = d₂·sin(θ₁) + d₄·sin(θ₁+θ₂) – d_tcp·sin(θ₃)·cos(θ₁+θ₂)
  p_y = d₃ + d_tcp·cos(θ₃)
  p_z = d₂·cos(θ₁) + d₄·cos(θ₁+θ₂) + d_tcp·sin(θ₃)·sin(θ₁+θ₂)

where the numeric constants come directly from the table:
  d₂ = 0.39225, d₃ = 0.093, d₄ = 0.09465, d_tcp = 0.0823.
Notice that the y–component depends only on θ₃. Thus we can solve for θ₃ by
  cos(θ₃) = (p_y – d₃)/d_tcp.
Next, observe that since the first two joints are rotations about Y the rotations commute so that R_y(θ₁)·R_y(θ₂) = R_y(θ₁+θ₂); moreover, the translations in link 2 and in link 3 simplify when expressed in the xz–plane. In fact, one may show that the xz–components can be recast as
  [ pₓ; p_z ] = d₂ [sin(θ₁); cos(θ₁)] + R [sin((θ₁+θ₂) – φ); cos((θ₁+θ₂) – φ)]
with
  R = √(d₄² + (d_tcp·sinθ₃)²)  and  φ = arctan2(d_tcp·sinθ₃, d₄).
Writing the target projection [pₓ;p_z] in “planar‐polar” form (with “radius” r_target = √(pₓ²+p_z²) and “angle” δ = arctan2(pₓ, p_z)) and “subtracting” the base “link” of length d₂ leads (by the cosine law) to the equation
  r_target·cos(θ₁ – δ) = (r_target² + d₂² – R²)/(2·d₂).
Thus one may solve for θ₁ as 
  θ₁ = δ ± arccos(((r_target²+d₂²–R²)/(2·d₂))/r_target).
(One then computes the “wrist” angle via (θ₁+θ₂) = (angle of [pₓ – d₂·sinθ₁, p_z – d₂·cosθ₁]) + φ.)
Finally, note that while position determines θ₁, θ₂, and θ₃, the remainder of the desired TCP orientation (which in the forward chain is given by 
  R = R_y(θ₁+θ₂)·R_z(θ₃)·R_y(θ₄)·R_z(1.570796325))
may be used to “back out” θ₄. In particular, once one computes R_target from the given rpy angles then one has 
  R_y(θ₄) = (R_y(θ₁+θ₂)·R_z(θ₃))ᵀ · R_target · R_z(–1.570796325)
and the (0,0) and (0,2) entries of this matrix yield θ₄ via
  θ₄ = arctan2([0,2], [0,0]).

------------------------------------------------------------

How the solution works:

1. We first compute θ₃ from the y–component of the TCP position.
2. Next we “project” the x–z position onto a planar 2–link problem (with one link of fixed length d₂ and an “effective” second link whose length is R = √(d₄² + (d_tcp·sinθ₃)²) and offset φ) to solve for θ₁ and then θ₂.
3. Finally the remaining orientation error is corrected by computing θ₄ from the desired TCP rotation (converted from rpy) after “removing” the effect of joints 1–3.

Note that due to the ± choices inherent in arccos and arctan2, two solution “branches” exist; here we choose one branch (e.g. the principal branch) for deterministic results. Also note that all angles are in radians.

This function is one acceptable analytical closed–form inverse kinematics solution for the specified 4–DOF manipulator.
