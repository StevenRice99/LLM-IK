I’m still working on a revised inverse–kinematics routine that reproduces the exact
roll / pitch / yaw triplet reported by the reference solver.  
Before producing the final code I need to experiment with the candidate–selection
logic by calling the supplied forward‑kinematics oracle, so in this turn I’ll make a
single oracle call for the pose that triggered the first failure.
