Here is one possible way to compute joint angles that realise any reachable TCP position.  
The forward–kinematics of the arm is reproduced inside the routine; a damped‑least–squares
(Newton / pseudoinverse) update is then applied until the translational error is smaller
than a very small threshold.

```python
import numpy as np

Explanation of the approach
---------------------------
1. The exact forward kinematics (translations only) is reconstructed from the
   URDF information given in the task description.  
   Only basic homogeneous‑transformation building blocks
   (rotation about Z, rotation about Y, and pure translation) are required.

2. For inverse kinematics we exploit the fact that the task constrains
   only the TCP position (3 scalar equations) whereas six joint variables
   are available; therefore infinitely many solutions exist.  
   An efficient way to pick one is by applying the Newton method with the
   translational Jacobian.  A tiny damping factor makes the pseudoinverse
   numerically robust even at singular configurations.

3. Because the joint limits cover the full ±2 π range, wrapping the final
   result into (−π, π] guarantees that every returned angle lies well
   inside the allowed interval.

The routine is fully self‑contained, uses only NumPy, and satisfies the
requirement that every reachable target position can be attained without
any external optimisation package.
