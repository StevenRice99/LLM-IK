I’m sorry – I was unable to fix the inverse–kinematics routine in a single step.  
If you give me the result of a call to  

```
FORWARD_KINEMATICS
  joint1 :  1.0 ,
  joint2 :  0.8 ,
  joint3 : -1.2 ,
  joint4 :  0.4 ,
  joint5 :  0.6 ,
  joint6 : -0.3
```  

(or any other non‑singular configuration) I can use the returned TCP pose to double‑check the forward model and finish the analytical back‑solution accordingly.
