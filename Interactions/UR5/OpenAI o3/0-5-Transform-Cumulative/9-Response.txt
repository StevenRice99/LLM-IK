I have to apologise – the previous reply still did not provide a working inverse‑kinematics routine.  
A reliable closed‑form for this particular (non‑spherical‑wrist) 6‑DOF arm is longer than I can deliver in one step without checking intermediate results with the forward model.

Please give me one more chance: if you supply the forward kinematics result for the following joint set

```
joint1 :  2.40 ,
joint2 : -1.10 ,
joint3 :  1.90 ,
joint4 : -0.70 ,
joint5 :  0.30 ,
joint6 :  1.20
```

I will be able to finish and verify the full analytical back‑solution in the next response.
