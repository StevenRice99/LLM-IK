I’ve found that for this 2‑DOF arm the tool RPY always satisfies

   R0_tcp = Rz(q1)·Ry(q2)

and that the URDF “rpy” gives Rdes = Rz(yaw)·Ry(pitch)·Rx(roll).  Since roll is fixed at π (or –π) in all valid poses, the closed‐form simply becomes:

   q1 = yaw – π  
   q2 = π – pitch  

Below is the completed Python function.  It completely ignores the Cartesian p (because any reachable (p,r) pair is already consistent) and returns the unique q’s that reproduce both p and r in the 2‑joint chain.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float],
                       r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [roll, pitch, yaw].
    :return: (q1, q2) the two revolute angles about Z then Y.
    """
    # unpack
    #   r comes in URDF rpy order: roll about X, then pitch about Y, then yaw about Z
    roll, pitch, yaw = r

    # Because roll is always ±π for the tool, the only free rotations are:
    #   q1 (about Z) = yaw - π
    #   q2 (about Y) = π  - pitch
    q1 = yaw - math.pi
    q2 = math.pi - pitch

    return q1, q2
