Here is a purely analytical, closed‐form inverse–kinematics implementation.  It uses only Python’s built‑ins (math), assumes the user’s requested orientation r is consistent (i.e. r[1] is the desired joint‑2 pitch, r[2] the desired joint‑1 yaw), and returns the principal solution for θ₁, θ₂.

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float],
                       r: tuple[float, float, float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p" and orientation "r".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :param r: The orientation to reach in radians in the form [x, y, z].
               Here we assume r = [roll, pitch, yaw] = [0, θ2, θ1].
    :return: (θ1, θ2) in radians.

    # Robot constants from URDF:
    #   Revolute‑1 at origin, axis Z
    #   Revolute‑2 offset 0.13585 in +Y, axis Y
    #   TCP offset from joint‑2 frame: [0, –0.1197, 0.425]
    a2 = 0.13585
    a3y = -0.1197
    d3  =  0.425

    # 1) Solve θ2 from the z–coordinate:

    cos_th2 = z / d3
    # clamp for numerical safety

    # two algebraic solutions: ±arccos

    if abs(th2_pos - pitch_desired) <= abs(th2_neg - pitch_desired):
        theta2 = th2_pos
    else:
        theta2 = th2_neg

    # 2) Solve θ1 from the projection into the XY plane.

    # The base rotation θ1 must align v to the planar projection of p:
    #    RotZ(θ1)·[vx, vy] = [px, py]
    # ⇒ ϕ_v = atan2(vy, vx), ϕ_p = atan2(py, px)
    # ⇒ θ1 = ϕ_p - ϕ_v
    phi_v = math.atan2(vy, vx)
    phi_p = math.atan2(y,   x)
    theta1 = phi_p - phi_v

    # 3) (Optional) normalize into [−π, π]
    theta1 = math.atan2(math.sin(theta1), math.cos(theta1))
    theta2 = math.atan2(math.sin(theta2), math.cos(theta2))

    return theta1, theta2

Explanation of the steps:

1.  **θ₂ from z**  
    The only joint that moves the TCP in z is the revolute‑2 pitch about Y.  
    p_z = 0.425·cos θ₂ ⇒ θ₂ = ±arccos(p_z/0.425).  
    We pick the +/– branch closest to the desired pitch r[1].

2.  **θ₁ from x,y**  
    After setting θ₂, the remaining planar link vector  
       v = [0, 0.13585, 0] + R_y(θ₂)·[0, –0.1197, 0.425]  
      simplifies to  
       v = [0.425·sin θ₂, 0.01615].  
    Rotating that by θ₁ about Z must land at the desired (x,y).  
    Hence θ₁ = atan2(y,x) – atan2(v_y, v_x).

3.  **Return** the two joint angles (θ₁, θ₂).
