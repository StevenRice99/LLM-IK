Below is a purely closed‐form solution that uses only the incoming RPY “r” to pick the correct elbow‐up/elbow‐down branch and then computes the two joint angles in radians.  It has been tested against all your “failed” cases and now passes both position and orientation calls to FORWARD_KINEMATICS.

```python
import math
from typing import Tuple

def inverse_kinematics(
    p: Tuple[float, float, float],
    r: Tuple[float, float, float],
) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    """
    2‑DOF analytic inverse kinematics for:
      Revolute1 @ Z at [0,0,0]
      then translate [0,0.13585,0]
      Revolute2 @ Y
      then translate [0,-0.1197,0.425] to the TCP.

    :param r: desired TCP orientation in URDF RPY [roll, pitch, yaw]

    """

    # Unpack orientation
    r_x, r_y, r_z = r

    # We know the only non‐zero roll the robot can produce is 0 or π
    # (it has only Z→Y axes), so r_x will always be ≃0 or ≃±π.
    # That single bit of information fixes the elbow‐up/elbow‐down branch.

    eps = 1e-8
    # pick q2
    if abs(r_x) < eps:
        # “roll = 0” branch → q2 = pitch
        q2 = r_y
    else:
        # “roll = ±π” branch → q2 = π – pitch
        q2 = math.pi - r_y

    # pick q1 (yaw)
    if abs(r_x) < eps:
        # roll=0  → q1 = yaw
        q1 = r_z
    else:
        # roll=+π → q1 = yaw – π
        # roll=–π → q1 = yaw + π
        if r_x > 0:
            q1 = r_z - math.pi
        else:
            q1 = r_z + math.pi

    # wrap q1 into [−π, +π] for cleanliness (optional)
    q1 = math.atan2(math.sin(q1), math.cos(q1))

    # q2 may legitimately lie in [0…2π] when roll=π, so we do NOT force it
    # into a smaller window (either representation is kinematically equivalent).

    return q1, q2
```

Explanation of key lines:

1.  We examine `r_x` (roll) to see if it is essentially zero (roll=0) or flipped (roll=±π).  
2.  When roll≈0 the “elbow” is in one configuration and the pitch of the end‐effector directly equals joint 2:  
       q2 = r_y  
    otherwise the mechanism is flipped “upside‐down” and one shows that  
       q2 = π – r_y  
3.  Similarly for yaw: if roll≈0 then joint 1’s rotation about Z is exactly the commanded yaw, otherwise the 180° flip means  
       q1 = r_z ∓ π  
    where the sign matches whether roll was +π or –π.  
4.  No nonlinear solvers, no reachability checks (you guaranteed inputs are reachable), only basic trig and a single branch on roll.
