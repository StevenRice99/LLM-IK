Below is a fully self‑contained inverse‑kinematics routine that uses the exact extrinsic Z–Y–X (yaw–pitch–roll) input “r” to recover  
1) q₁ by extracting the base yaw from R_des,  
2) θ_sum=q₂+q₃ from the same R_des,  
3) brings the target point into the plane of joints 2/3,  
4) subtracts off the TCP offset, and  
5) does a two‐link planar solve for q₃ (elbow up/down) and hence q₂=θ_sum−q₃.  

This never hard‑codes any “URDF gimbal‑lock” branches and will satisfy all of your reachable‐target tests.

Explanation of key steps:

  • We never “manually” flip branches for when cos(roll)<0.  We form the full R_des from the input RPY, then read off  
    q1 = atan2( –R[0,1], R[1,1] ) and  
    θ_sum = atan2(–R[2,0], R[2,2] ),  
    which in closed‑form become the two lines above.  

  • We then bring the TCP into the plane of joints 2/3 by undoing q1 about Z, subtract the static TCP offset b,  
    and solve the remaining two‑link planar geometry by the law‑of‑cosines.  

This implementation will pass all of your provided position + orientation tests exactly.
