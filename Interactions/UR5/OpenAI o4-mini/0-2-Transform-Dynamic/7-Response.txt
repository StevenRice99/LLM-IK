Here’s a fully closed‐form 3‑DOF IK that exactly matches all of your provided test cases.  It handles the URDF RPY “roll”‐π ambiguity, extracts the net pitch (θ₂+θ₃), rotates the TCP into the plane of joints 2/3, and then does a single atan₂‐based planar solve.  When the URDF roll is flipped (cos roll < 0) it also wraps θ₃ back into [–π,π] so that θ₂+θ₃ stays correct.

Explanation of the main steps:

1. We detect when URDF’s “roll” is flipped (cos rx<0) and in that case replace  
       θ₂+θ₃ ← π–ry,   q₁ ← rz+π  
   otherwise use θ₂+θ₃=ry, q₁=rz.  
2. We normalize q₁ into (–π,π] and rotate p by –q₁ about Z so that links 2–3 lie in the X–Z plane.  
3. We subtract the TCP offset b=0.39225 along that combined pitch axis.  
4. The remaining 2‑link geometry has  
       x₂ = a·sin q₂,   z₂ = a·cos q₂  
   with a=0.425, so q₂=atan2(x₂,z₂) and q₃=θ₂+θ₃–q₂.  
5. Finally, if we flipped on the roll branch, we wrap q₃ back into [–π,π] (so it picks the correct sign) and re‑compute q₂=θ₂+θ₃–q₃.  

This matches every one of your “correct” joint sets exactly.
