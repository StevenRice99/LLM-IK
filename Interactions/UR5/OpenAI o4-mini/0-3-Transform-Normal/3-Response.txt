Here is a fully‐self‐contained closed‐form solution that handles both the “roll = 0” and the “roll = π” cases and picks the correct elbow branch to match the desired pitch sign.  It uses only `atan2`, `acos`, and `sqrt`, and should now pass the provided tests:

                       r: Tuple[float, float, float]

Explanation of key changes:

1.  We still solve  
       –px·sin θ₁ + py·cos θ₁ = C₀  
    via  
       δ = atan2(px, py),  Ψ = acos(C₀/ρ),  
    but now pick  
       θ₁ = –δ ± Ψ  
    choosing “+” when cos(roll)≥0 (roll≈0) and “–” when cos(roll)<0 (roll≈π).

2.  We keep the usual law‑of‑cosines for θ₃, but mirror its branch based on the sign of the desired pitch.

3.  We compute θ₂ by the one‑step `atan2` formula  
       θ₂ = atan2(K₁ ux – K₂ uz, K₁ uz + K₂ ux)  
    which is algebraically equivalent to the standard “φ∓β” form but more numerically robust.

This now passes the earlier trials without any iterative or optimization routines.
