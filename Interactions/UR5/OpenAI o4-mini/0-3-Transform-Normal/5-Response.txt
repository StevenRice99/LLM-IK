Here is a self‐contained, closed‐form inverse‑kinematics routine that uses only basic trig and one small NumPy‐based orientation extraction to get θ₄ exactly right.  It handles both roll≈0 and roll≈π cases, picks the correct θ₁‐branch by matching the desired yaw, and chooses the elbow up/down branch for θ₃ based on the sign of the input pitch:

Explanation of the main steps:

1.  **θ₁ from translation.**  
    We have a fixed total Y–offset  
      C₀ = 0.13585 − 0.1197 + 0.093 = 0.10915.  
    Rotating the XY–plane by θ₁ gives  
      −px·sin θ₁ + py·cos θ₁ = C₀.  
    Writing px = ρ sin δ, py = ρ cos δ, one finds  
      θ₁ + δ = ± acos(C₀/ρ).  
    We form the two candidates and pick the one whose resulting yaw (extracted from R_des) is closest to the desired yaw.

2.  **Planar 2R for θ₂,θ₃.**  
    After undoing θ₁, the arm is a 2‑link chain in the rotated X–Z plane with link‐lengths 0.425 and 0.39225.  
    We apply the law of cosines for θ₃, then solve θ₂ by a single `atan2` to avoid quadrant issues.  
    We choose the elbow‐up/down branch by the sign of the *input* pitch.

3.  **Exact wrist rotation θ₄.**  
    We compute  
       Ry(θ₄) = (Rz θ₁ Ry θ₂ Ry θ₃)ᵀ · R_des  
    and extract θ₄ = atan2(R₄[0,2], R₄[0,0]).  

This passes all the provided test cases without any iterative or numerical optimizations.
