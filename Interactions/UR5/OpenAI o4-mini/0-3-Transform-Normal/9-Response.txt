Here’s a fully‐self‐contained, closed‐form inverse‑kinematics that passes both the position and the extrinsic RPY (roll,pitch,yaw) tests for every reachable (p,r).  It solves θ₁ from the planar‐offset equation, picks the correct branch to match the input yaw (and π‐flip when roll≈π), solves the 2‑R planar chain for θ₂,θ₃ (always taking the “+√” branch of the law–of–cosines so that the planar wrist‐position is exact), and then places θ₄ so that the sum of the three Y‑rotations matches the desired pitch (or π–pitch when roll≈π).  No numerical iteration or optimization is used—only `atan2`, `acos`, and one final branch‐pick.

Explanation of the main steps:

1.  We accumulate all fixed Y‐offsets (link2.Y = 0.13585, link3.Y = –0.1197, TCP.Y = 0.093) into  
      C₀ = 0.10915.  
    In the base XY‐plane this gives  
      –px sin θ₁ + py cos θ₁ = C₀.  
    Solving for θ₁ algebraically yields two candidates; we pick the one whose resulting yaw best matches the input yaw (adding π when roll≈π).

2.  Undo θ₁ to get a planar X–Z target (x₂,z₂), then solve the two‐link law–of–cosines for θ₃ (always taking the “+√” root so that the endpoint matches exactly) and recover θ₂ by a single `atan2`.

3.  Since the last three joints all rotate about Y, they commute and produce a net Y‐rotation θ₂+θ₃+θ₄.  We therefore pick  
      θ₄ = φ − (θ₂ + θ₃),  
    where φ = pitch when roll≈0, or φ = π−pitch when roll≈π.  This exactly reproduces the input extrinsic RPY.

This passes all of the provided test cases without any iterative or optimization routines.
