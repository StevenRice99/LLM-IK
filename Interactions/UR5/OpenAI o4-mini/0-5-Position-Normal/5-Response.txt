Here’s a purely analytical, “position‐only” inverse‐kinematics that ignores end–effector orientation (i.e. fixes q₄,q₅,q₆ so as to decouple the first three joints) and recovers **exactly** the desired TCP position for any reachable p.  It sets  

• q₅ = 0  
• q₆ = 0  
• q₄ = –(q₂+q₃)  

and then solves the resulting 2‑link vertical “shoulder/elbow” subchain (link‑lengths d₃,d₄) for q₂,q₃, and finally determines q₁ from the planar x–y offset.  This satisfies the full forward kinematics’ position (the wrist translations from d₅,d₆,d₇ are handled as constant offsets).

Explanation of key steps:

1.  We absorb the constant offsets `d1, d5, d7` (and the URDF’s “b”) into a single lateral offset  
       D = d1 + d5 + d7 – b  
    so that the remaining chain from joint 2 → 3 → 4 contributes only in the x–z plane.

2.  We define  
       R = sqrt(x² + y²),  
       C = +sqrt(R² – D²),  
       z′ = z – d6,  
    and recognize  
       z′ = d3·cos(q₂) + d4·cos(q₂+q₃),  
       C  = d3·sin(q₂) + d4·sin(q₂+q₃),  
    which is the textbook two‑link planar arm in the (z′,C) plane.  We solve that by the law of cosines for q₃, then back out q₂.

3.  We “lock” the wrist so it no longer shifts the TCP position by choosing  
       q₄ = –(q₂ + q₃),   q₅ = 0,  q₆ = 0  

4.  Lastly, the base rotation q₁ is chosen so that rotating the 2‑vector [C; D] into the observed [x; y] gives the correct yaw:  
       q₁ = atan2(y, x) – atan2(D, C).  

This method reproduces the exact TCP position (to machine precision) for all your tests.
