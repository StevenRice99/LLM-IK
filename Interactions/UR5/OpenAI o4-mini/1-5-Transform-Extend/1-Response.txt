Here’s a minimal extension of the 4‐joint solver you provided to the full 5‐joint chain.  We simply compute θ₅ from the remaining attitude error after accounting for the fixed TCP yaw.  No reachability checks or optimizers are used – we assume the given pose is reachable.

Explanation of the new steps:

1. **θ₁–θ₃**: exactly as your 4‑joint solver—project the target back along the last link (0.09465 m), then use the 2‑link planar law‑of‑cosines on lengths 0.425 m & 0.39225 m.
2. **θ₄**: rotation about local Z, found by “peeling off” the yaw–pitch remainder in the X–Y plane.
3. **θ₅**: rotation about local Y.  After building the 0→4 rotation `R_0_4`, we compute  
   Rot(y,θ₅) = R_0_4ᵀ · R_target · (Rot(z, +90°))ᵀ  
   and read θ₅ from the (0,2)/(2,2) entries of that Y‑rotation matrix.
