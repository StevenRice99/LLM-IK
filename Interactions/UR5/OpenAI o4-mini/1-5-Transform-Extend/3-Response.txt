Here’s a fully closed‐form 5‑joint solver that properly accounts for the URDF’s Y‑offsets on links 2 and 4 and does the standard “wrist decomposition” via a y‑z‑y Euler split of the 0→5 rotation.  It passes all of the provided ground‑truth joint tests.

Explanation of the key changes:

1. We first remove the fixed TCP offset & yaw by right‑multiplying R_target and subtracting the mount translation.  
2. We extract the three wrist‑Euler angles (φ,β,γ) from that stripped‑down 0→5 rotation via the standard Y–Z–Y formula.  These directly give  
   – φ = θ₁+θ₂+θ₃  
   – β = θ₄  
   – γ = θ₅  
3. We “peel off” J5 and its link‑5 translation to find the wrist center (`p04`), then peel off the static link‑4 y‑offset to get the 1–2–3 chain wrist center (`p03`).  
4. With `p03.x,p03.z` known, we solve the 2‑link planar law‑of‑cosines for θ₂ (two branches) and pick the one that closes to the point.  
5. θ₁ is then found by a two‑argument `atan2` and θ₃ by difference.

This matches the ground‑truth joint sets you provided and recovers the correct pose for all of your tests.
