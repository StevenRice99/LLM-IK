The code was tested on multiple trials with valid inputs but failed to reach all targets. The solution for the joints generated from a working inverse kinematics solver have been provided for you to learn from:
Failed to reach position [-0.310393084189222, -0.10897629104022101, -0.7851299497198381] and orientation [3.116690926761482, 0.018371942753227, -1.586245779791849]. Instead reached position [-0.2942514457729632, -0.10897629104243493, -0.7275318979304749] and orientation [3.1166909267944507, 0.018371942797918317, -1.5862457779972057]. The correct joint values were [-2.655820017977595, 1.23123404999999996854923435367357154035516941803507506847381591796875E-7, -1.357441276260853, 3.165596550707256, 5.38675698785686] and the joints produced by the code were [-2.868355611195887, 0, 1.9966870352579633, 3.1175887575930705, 2.24516427587122].
