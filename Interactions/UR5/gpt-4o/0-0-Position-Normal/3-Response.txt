The failures indicate a sign inconsistency in how the solution interprets the relationship between the target position and the calculated joint angle \( \theta \). Specifically, the correct joint values are the negatives of those returned by the current implementation. To fix this issue, we need to negate the calculated angle \( \theta \) to align the solution with the expected behavior.

### Corrected Implementation:
```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p: The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    # Extract the x and y components of the target position
    x, y, z = p

    # Compute the angle theta using atan2 and negate it to match the expected orientation
    theta = -math.atan2(x, y)
    
    return theta
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
1. **Issue Identified**:
   - The forward kinematics likely applies a rotation matrix that rotates in the opposite direction of the computed angle \( \theta \) in the current implementation.
   - This results in the manipulator being mirrored across the axis of rotation, leading to positions that are reflections of the target.

2. **Fix Applied**:
   - Negating the computed angle \( \theta \) resolves this issue by ensuring the rotation aligns with the forward kinematics.

This corrected implementation should now produce joint values consistent with the desired targets.
