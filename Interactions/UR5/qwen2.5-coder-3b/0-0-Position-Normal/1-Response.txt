To solve the inverse kinematics problem for the given 1-degree-of-freedom serial manipulator, we need to determine the joint angle that will place the TCP at the desired position \([0, 0.13585, 0]\). The manipulator has a single revolute joint with an axis of rotation along the Z-axis.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to derive the inverse kinematics solution:

1. **Understand the Manipulator Geometry:**
   - The manipulator has one link.
   - The position of the TCP is given as \([0, 0.13585, 0]\).
   - The joint axis is along the Z-axis.

2. **Define the Position Vectors:**
   - Let \( p_{\text{TCP}} = [x_{\text{TCP}}, y_{\text{TCP}}, z_{\text{TCP}}] \) be the position of the TCP.
   - Let \( p_{\text{link}} = [0, 0, l] \) be the position of the link relative to its base.

3. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The distance between the base and the TCP is given by:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{x_{\text{TCP}}^2 + y_{\text{TCP}}^2}
     \]
   - Since the link is along the Z-axis, the position of the link relative to the base can be written as:
     \[
     p_{\text{link}} = [0, 0, l]
     \]

4. **Determine the Joint Angle:**
   - The joint angle \(\theta\) is the angle between the link and the horizontal plane.
   - Using trigonometry, we can find \(\theta\) as follows:
     \[
     \cos(\theta) = \frac{x_{\text{TCP}}}{d}
     \]
     \[
     \sin(\theta) = \frac{y_{\text{TCP}}}{d}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Joint Angle:**
   - The joint angle \(\theta\) can be calculated using the arctangent function:
     \[
     \theta = \arctan2(y_{\text{TCP}}, x_{\text{TCP}})
     \]
   - Ensure that the angle is within the specified limits \([-6.2831853, 6.2831853]\).

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def inverse_kinematics(p: tuple[float, float, float]) -> float:
    """
    Gets the joint values needed to reach position "p".
    :param p :The position to reach in the form [x, y, z].
    :return: The value to set the link to for reaching position "p".
    """
    x_tcp, y_tcp, z_tcp = p
    
    # Calculate the distance from the base to the TCP
    d = math.sqrt(x_tcp**2 + y_tcp**2)
    
    # Calculate the joint angle using arctan2
    theta = math.atan2(y_tcp, x_tcp)
    
    # Ensure the angle is within the specified limits
    if theta < -math.pi:
        theta += 2 * math.pi
    elif theta > math.pi:
        theta -= 2 * math.pi
    
    return theta

# Example usage
target_position = (0, 0.13585, 0)
joint_angle = inverse_kinematics(target_position)
print(f"The joint angle to reach the target position is: {joint_angle} radians")
```

This function calculates the joint angle \(\theta\) that will place the TCP at the desired position \([0, 0.13585, 0]\) for a single revolute joint along the Z-axis. The result is within the specified limits of \([-6.2831853, 6.2831853]\).
