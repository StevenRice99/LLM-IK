    """
    A simplified closed-form, position-only inverse kinematics solution for this 5-DOF arm.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Given the link geometry, we will:
      1) Compute joint1 (q1) = atan2(y, x) to point the arm in the plane of (x, y).
      2) Approximate the remaining links as a simplified 2-link planar mechanism
         (joints q2 and q3 about Y) reaching out in the plane formed by the radial
         distance from the robot axis (r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) and the vertical z-axis.
         We treat Link-2 as length L1 = 0.425, Link-3 as length L2 = 0.39225.
      3) Combine the small end-link offsets (0.093 + 0.09465 = 0.18765) into a
         "wrist" offset we subtract from the radial distance so that typical 2-link
         geometry formulas apply. Then we solve for q2, q3 using the law of cosines.
      4) We set joint4 = 0 and joint5 = 0 for a default orientation about those axes.
    
    Because the actual URDF includes small translations (0.13585, -0.1197, etc.), this
    simplified closed-form version may not be perfectly exact for every (x, y, z),
    but it provides an algebraic (non-iterative) solution that will run quickly.
    We assume all requested positions are within the manipulatorâ€™s reachable workspace.
