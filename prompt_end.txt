2. Fully implement the closed-form analytical inverse kinematics solution you produced in the following Python method. You may not leave any parts incomplete or with placeholder values as the inverse kinematics must be fully implemented.

def inverse_kinematics(p: list, q: list) -> list:
	"""
	Solve the inverse kinematics to reach position and rotation, both in the reference frame of the chain's origin.
	:param p: The position for the end effector to reach in the Cartesian form [x, y, z].
	:param q: The orientation for the end effector to reach in the quaternion form [w, x, y, z].
	:return: A list of the joint values in radians needed for the end effector to reach the position and orientation.
	"""
	# You must complete this method fully without any placeholder parts.
